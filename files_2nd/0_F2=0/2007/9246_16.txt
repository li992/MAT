Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 note 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 11 March 2008 and the balance sheet was signed on the Boards behalf by P J Hill and J C Silver.
The Laird Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill and the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations and defined benefit assets.
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 17.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 36.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Group comprises The Laird Group PLC the Group and all of its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, plus any costs directly attributable to the combination.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities and is recognised as goodwill.
Currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the Income Statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the Income Statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
58 The Laird Group PLC note 2 Accounting policies continued Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the Income Statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 during the year, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where a right to a refund exists.
This is a change in accounting policy.
Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect this.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they become payable.
Share based payments The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income Statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis.
The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending on its nature.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met.
Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than three years.
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The Laird Group PLC 59 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 note 2 Accounting policies continued Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Income Statement.
Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
Interest Interest is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years or less Leasehold buildings 50 years or the lease term if less Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and are expensed to the Income Statement as incurred.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
60 The Laird Group PLC note 2 Accounting policies continued Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is a component of the Group that operates within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
Exceptional items These items are presented within the relevant Income Statement category.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Trade receivables are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the Income Statement.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the Income Statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the Income Statement.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
The Laird Group PLC 61 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 note 2 Accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Net investment hedges These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swap contract has not been designated as a hedge and gains or losses arising on this contract are taken to the Income Statement.
During the year the Group has adopted IFRS 7, which gives further disclosure surrounding the Groups financial instruments.
The new disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
While there has been no effect on the financial position or results, comparative information has been revised where necessary.
Treasury shares The Laird Group PLC shares held in the Laird Group 1990 Employee Benefit Trust ESOP are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash in the balance sheet comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses principally administration costs are excluded.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling, and distribution.
Provisions These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced on or before the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.

The Groups average expected tax rate is a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates and may vary depending upon results in each jurisdiction.
On 21 March 2007, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that with effect from 1 April 2008 the standard rate of UK Corporation tax will reduce from 30% to 28%.
The reduced tax rate was included in the Finance Bill 2007.
The Finance Bill passed through the House of Commons on 27 June 2007 and is therefore considered substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits.
The total amount of research and development activity expensed during 2007 is 25.1m 2006, 20.9m.
There is no indication of impairment for capitalised development costs.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
No indications of impairment to goodwill were identified.
Antenna and Wireless Systems had a goodwill balance of 182.3m at the year end 2006, 135.6m.
Electronic Components and Systems had a goodwill balance of 179.4m at the year end 2006, 172.2m.
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
For Antenna and Wireless Systems and Electronic Components and Systems the key assumptions were: Projected cash flows for 2008 to 2012 2006: 2007 to 2011 The equity market risk premium, calculated as 4.0% 2006, 4.0%.
This is an internally calculated figure, having been confirmed with external advisors as being reasonable Lairds beta, calculated as 1.1 2006, 1.1.
This is an internally calculated figure, having been confirmed with external advisors as being reasonable The forecasts provided are based on figures approved internally for the 2008 budget, which also include estimates for 2009 to 2012.
Cash flow for 2013 has been increased at a conservative rate estimate of 3% 2006, 3% per annum.
The cash flow figures were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1% 2006, 10.3%.
With regard to the assessment of value in use for both Antenna and Wireless Systems and Electronic Components and Systems, management believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the value in use to be lower than the carrying value.
The Laird Group PLC 73 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 note 17 Intangible assets continued Other acquired intangible assets Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets: Brand names 5 years Trade secrets 8 to 15 years Trade marks and names 5 to 15 years Patents the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right Licence the remaining duration of the 20 year legal right Customer relationships 10 years The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period.
Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an indefinite life.
18 Business combinations Acquisition of businesses in 2007 The Group purchased three businesses during the year for a total consideration of 83.4m in cash, all of these purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Book and fair values of the net assets of businesses acquired, stated at rates of exchange at the date of acquisition were as follows: Fair values Book to the values Group m m Property, plant and equipment 1.3 1.3 Intangible assets 31.1 Inventories 3.3 3.3 Trade and other receivables 7.8 7.5 Income tax recoverable payable 0.3 1.2 Trade and other payables 6.3 6.3 Deferred tax liabilities 1.0 10.3 Net assets acquired 5.4 25.4 Goodwill arising on acquisition 58.0 Consideration 83.4 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration including transaction costs 82.4 Deferred cash consideration 2.6 Net cash acquired 1.6 83.4 In January 2007, AeroComm Inc, a USA based supplier of wireless communications solutions was acquired for a consideration of 19.1m.

Also in February 2007, M2sys Co. Ltd, a South Korean based supplier of actuation devices, was acquired for 17.0m.
The Group has acquired a 100% interest in all of the acquisitions noted above.
Underlying profit before tax for the entities acquired in the period totals 11.9m since acquisition.
If all of the acquisitions noted above had been held for the full year, revenues would have been 7.8m higher at 572.1m and profits would have been 1.4m higher, at 52.9m.
There have been changes made during 2007 to the provisional fair values of 114.2m assigned to acquisitions made in 2006 and deferred consideration arising from prior year acquisition agreements.
The effect of these changes was to increase goodwill carried forward at 31 December 2007 by 0.2m and total consideration by 0.3m.
Details of all significant subsidiaries held by the Group are disclosed in the list of Principal subsidiaries on page 94.
After the balance sheet date the Group has acquired Ezurio Limited for a consideration of 12.5m.

Also in December 2006, Coolab AB, a Swedish based supplier of thermoelectric modules and cooling systems, was acquired for 8.9m.
Profit before tax for the entities acquired in the period totals 2.9m since acquisition.
If all of the acquisitions noted above had been held for the full year, continuing revenues would have been 37.7m higher at 408.3m and continuing profits would have been 2.2m higher, at 41.8m, discontinued revenues would have been 1.8m higher at 239.5m and discontinued profits would have been 0.3m higher at 27.1m.

The effect of the interest rate swaps are discussed under fair value hedges below.
Derivative financial instruments The Group holds interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure with an underlying notional principal amount of $70m.
The contracts have not been designated as a hedge and the increase in the fair value during 2007 of 1.2m 2006, 0.2m, has been taken to the Income Statement.
Interest rate and currency profile The Groups policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs.
$70.0m 35.2m of US Private Placement loans were swapped from fixed to variable interest rates for a five year term, expiring in 2009.
Interest rate risk The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The interest rate considered is US dollar, being the currency in which the Group has historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.
Where the Group has taken out fixed to variable interest rate swaps, the hedged loans are treated as floating rate borrowings for the purpose of the sensitivity analysis.
The 2007 analysis below reflects a larger possible change in interest rates than in 2006, due to increased volatility in the financial markets.
Effect on profit before tax m 2007 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 0.3 A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
2006 25 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 0.2 A 25 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
The Laird Group PLC 81 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 note 28 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Laird Technologies customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares.
Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context.
Foreign currency risk The Groups revenues and profits are affected by currency movements on translating overseas revenues and profits into sterling for reporting purposes.
The actual translation effects on cross border transactions which involve the sale of goods and services in currencies foreign to a Group entity are not significant taking into account that a number of currencies are linked to the US dollar.
The Group does not have significant transactional currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities on which net currency gains and losses would be recognised in the Income Statement.
The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities, and forward currency contracts and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges.
Effect on profit Effect on before tax equity m m 2007 5% appreciation of the US dollar 2.1 4.5 5% appreciation of the Euro 0.4 5% appreciation of the Renminbi 0.7 2006 5% appreciation of the US dollar 1.4 6.3 5% appreciation of the Euro 0.2 5% appreciation of the Renminbi 1.0 A 5% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2007 the Group held no forward foreign exchange contracts 2006, 34 designated as hedges of expected future purchases from overseas suppliers.
The forward currency contracts were used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these purchases.
The terms of these contracts were for the Group to purchase a total of US$22,750,000 between 3 January 2007 and 27 September 2007 at an average exchange rate of US$ 1.9093.
The fair value movement in the period on these contracts was nil 2006, loss of 0.3m.
Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $181.7m of debt 91.3m which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States subsidiaries, Czk 374.1m 10.3m designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Czech Republic subsidiary and Sek 122.7m 9.6m designated as a hedge of the net investment in Swedish subsidiaries.
These amounts are being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Expiring between four and five years 165.8 150.8 165.8 150.8 Loan covenants The principal covenants in the Groups committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net borrowings are based on UK GAAP and are set out below: Interest cover The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, and amortisation EBITA to be not less than 2.5 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2007.
Fair value of financial instruments The US Private Placement loans with a book value of 81.2m 2006, 96.6m have an estimated fair value of 78.1m 2006, 96.0m which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2007.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

During the year 218,464 ordinary shares were issued under the Companys 1994 executive share option scheme for a consideration of 680,933 and 1,026,712 ordinary shares were issued under the Companys 2003 executive share option scheme for a consideration of 2,522,583.
177,262,248 ordinary shares of 28.125p each were in issue at the year end 2006, 198,174,845 shares of 25p each.
At 31 December 2007, options to subscribe for 2,272,388 ordinary shares at prices between 161p and 587.5p were outstanding under the Companys executive share option schemes.
Options outstanding under the schemes are held by 29 individuals and are exercisable at various times up to 15 May 2017.
No further options have been granted since the year end.
30 Share based payments The Directors remuneration report on pages 45 to 51, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting requirements for the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plans.
Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan RSP vest 3 years after they have been awarded to the employee, provided the employee is still employed by the Group.
All share based payments are equity settled.
An expense of 2.0m was recognised in the year 2006, 1.6m before employers national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded and the share options granted.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards in issue at the beginning of the year, and those granted during the year.

The balance of the share options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and do not result in a charge against profits in accordance with the transitional arrangements of IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 542p 2006, 383p.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2007, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4.4 years 2006, 4.0 years.
The Laird Group PLC 85 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 note 30 Share based payments continued The following table shows the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movements in share options issued under the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 571p 2006, 380p.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2007, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 7.3 years 2006, 7.6 years.

The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
The non-market company performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of LTIP awards during the year was 439p 2006, 253p, of RSP awards during the year was 545p 2006, 427p and of share options granted during the year was 162p 2006, 119p.

The expected volatility of the LTIP and RSP shares is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on LTIP or RSP shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.

90 The Laird Group PLC note 36 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
15 employees 2006, 400 are members of six different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 2,100 2006, 1,900 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 14.1m 2006, 3.2m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2007, at their market value, is estimated at 97.9m 2006, 83.2m and the liabilities estimated at 88.9m 2006, 93.2m.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on the balance sheet where there is an unconditional right to a refund.
The resultant aggregate net pension asset under IAS 19 is 8.1m 2006, 10.4m deficit.
The impact of adopting IFRIC 14 was to recognise 11.8m 2006, 0.5m of retirement benefit assets and to increase the actuarial gains recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense from 8.8m loss to 3.0m gain 2006, 4.2m gain to 4.7m gain.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension assets and liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows: Schemes Schemes in surplus in surplus with a right Other with a right Other to a refund schemes Total to a refund schemes Total restated restated restated 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 m m m m m m Annuities 3.9 4.9 8.8 10.3 10.3 Equities 32.9 8.3 41.2 4.2 41.3 45.5 Gilts and bonds 31.0 9.8 40.8 27.3 27.3 Other including cash 7.0 0.1 7.1 0.1 0.1 Total market value of assets 74.8 23.1 97.9 4.2 79.0 83.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 62.3 26.6 88.9 3.3 89.9 93.2 Funded status 12.5 3.5 9.0 0.9 10.9 10.0 Disallowed assets 0.2 0.7 0.9 0.4 0.4 Surplus deficit in the schemes 12.3 4.2 8.1 0.5 10.9 10.4 There are minor variations in the assumptions used by the different actuaries employed to value the separate schemes.
The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.9% per annum 2006, 4.8% and those for equities at 8.4% per annum 2006, 7.8%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates of return from the main asset classes.
For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed.
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
The mortality assumption used at the year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each members year of birth.
The expected lifetime of a participant who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on the above mortality tables: Age Males Females 65 21.9 24.8 65 in 15 years 22.8 25.6 For IAS 19 the schemes liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 3.4% per annum 2006, 3.0%, salary increases of 4.4% per annum 2006, 4.0% and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.7% per annum 2006, 5.1%.
The only variation to these assumptions was the discount rate used to calculate the liabilities of the Laird Technologies plan, which was 4.9% per annum 2006, 6.0%.

The directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense from the date of inception of the company schemes to 31 December 2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to defined benefit plans will be 1.1m in 2008, which is expected to include 0.7m of additional contributions to be paid over and above regular contributions.
Within Sweden, the Group operates a plan, included within a multi-employer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a defined benefit plan, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Groups proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the plan.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the plan.
As a result the scheme is reported as if it were a defined contribution plan, although it is actually a defined benefit plan.
