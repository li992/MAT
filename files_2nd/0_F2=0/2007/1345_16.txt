First priority senior secured credit facility In connection with the NationsRent acquisition, on 31 August 2006 the Group repaid the outstanding borrowings under its $800m first priority asset based senior secured loan facility and replaced it with a new $1.75bn first priority asset based senior secured loan facility ABL facility.
The new ABL facility consists of a $1.5bn revolving credit facility and a $250m term loan and is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.

At 30 April 2007 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 175bp.
The ABL facility carries minimal amortisation of 1% per annum $2.5m on the term loan and is committed until August 2011.
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are tested only if available liquidity is less than $125m.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2007 was 295m $589m reecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 18.6m $37.2m.
As the ABL facility is asset based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.

The Group has an unrecognised UK deferred tax asset of 2.0m 2006: 34.3m in respect of losses, as it is not considered probable this deferred tax asset will be utilised.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 11.6m 2006: 9.2m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Awards were granted under this plan in 2000 and 2001 and are exercisable up to February 2010 and 2011, respectively, as all performance conditions have been satisfied.
On exercise by the option holder, the difference between the mid-market price of Ashtead Group plc shares on that day and the grant prices of 94.09p and 115.31p, for the 2000 and 2001 awards respectively, multiplied by the number of units held will be paid by way of a cash award to the holder, net of applicable taxes.
The fair value of the awards at 30 April 2007 was based on the share price on that date.
Investment Incentive Plan Details of the Investment Incentive Plan IIP are given on page 41.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
No awards were granted under the IIP in 2007.
The fair value of awards granted during 2004 was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 48.50p, nil exercise price, no dividend yield, volatility of 125.4%, a risk free rate of 4.9% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.

qxd 12 7 07 12:20 pm Page 79 79 ASHTEAD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 ACQUISITIONS NationsRent Companies, Inc. NationsRent On 31 August 2006, Sunbelt acquired the entire issued share capital of NationsRent for a total consideration of $592m plus acquisition costs.
As part of the NationsRent acquisition, the Group has also agreed to pay deferred contingent consideration of up to $89m.
The amount of the deferred contingent consideration is linked to the Companys share price performance over the three years from 1 September 2006 to 31 August 2009.
In the event that the Companys share price measured on a five day average basis rises by more than 22.2% above the reference price of 204p as adjusted for the bonus element of the rights issue, contingent consideration becomes payable at the rate of $5m for every additional 1% rise in the share price up to a maximum of 40% above the reference price.
Accordingly, deferred contingent consideration starts to become payable when the Companys share price reaches 250p with the maximum $89m being payable at 286p.
The contingent consideration is payable on a quarterly basis in cash.
It is not practicable to estimate reliably the amount of contingent consideration which will become payable and accordingly no provision has been made.
NationsRents revenues and estimated operating profits under IFRS and Ashtead Group plc specic accounting policies for the period pre-acquisition 1 May to 31 August 2006 were $230.7m and $19.2m respectively.
For the previous full year 1 May 2005 to 30 April 2006 NationsRents estimated revenue and operating profit were $605.8m and $14.9m respectively on the same accounting basis.
Due to the operational integration of NationsRent and Sunbelt since acquisition, in particular the movement of rental equipment between profit centres and the merger of some profit centres, it is not practical to report the revenue and profit of the acquired business post acquisition.
The provisional goodwill arising on acquisition is as follows: Acquirees At estimated book value fair value m m Net assets acquired Inventory 31.4 28.0 Trade and other receivables 55.4 54.4 Cash and cash equivalents 6.5 6.5 Property, plant and equipment: rental equipment 287.5 340.4 other assets 45.1 39.8 Intangible assets tradename and distribution agreements 4.3 17.9 Assets held for sale 31.1 Trade and other payables 85.7 90.8 Deferred tax liability net of acquired tax losses of 28.7m 5.4 29.2 Debt 220.0 232.6 Net assets acquired 119.1 165.5 Consideration paid Cash 311.2 Amount receivable relating to adjustment to initial consideration 0.3 Directly attributable costs 6.1 317.0 Goodwill 151.5 The book value of NationsRent in the table above is stated under US GAAP.
On emergence from bankruptcy in 2003 NationsRent adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in a significant write down in the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, particularly property, plant and equipment.
Accordingly, it is not practicable to present the book value of NationsRents assets under IFRS.
$28.0m of the consideration payable for the ordinary equity share capital of NationsRent was paid at closing to an escrow agent to secure the warranties and indemnities given by the vendors in the merger agreement.
$22.0m has already been released with $21.5m going to the vendors and $0.5m returned to Sunbelt.
The remainder will either be released to the vendors in stages by 31 August 2007 as the related warranties and indemnities expire or will be used to meet any agreed warranty or indemnity claims.
qxd 11 7 07 11:46 am Page 80 80 ASHTEAD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED Lux Trafc Controls Limited Lux On 16 October 2006, A-Plant purchased the entire issued share capital of Lux for total consideration of 15.8m and attributable costs of 0.3m.
The acquisition included arrangements for the vendor to acquire from Lux for cash immediately after closing assets valued at 0.3m and consequently, before costs, there was a net cash outow of 15.5m in connection with the acquisition.
The consideration payable was subject to downwards only adjustment to the extent that Luxs net assets at closing are less than 4.25m.
The necessary closing accounts have now been prepared and agreed with 60,000 of the 0.5m escrow amount being returned and the balance released to the vendor.
The net assets acquired and the goodwill arising on the acquisition are summarised in the table below: Acquirees book value At fair value m m Net assets acquired Inventory 0.3 0.1 Trade and other receivables 2.4 2.8 Assets acquired by the vendor immediately after closing 0.3 0.3 Property, plant and equipment: rental equipment 3.8 4.2 other assets 0.7 0.5 Intangible assets tradenames, customer list and non-competes 3.1 Trade and other payables 2.8 2.8 Short term borrowings 0.3 0.3 Deferred tax liabilities 0.4 1.3 Debt 0.2 0.2 3.8 6.4 Consideration paid Paid in cash at closing 15.8 Directly attributable costs 0.3 16.1 Goodwill 9.7 Luxs revenue and operating profit in the period from 1 May 2006 to 16 October 2006 were 9.5m and 0.6m, respectively.
For the same reasons as NationsRent, it is not practical to report the revenue and profit of the acquired business post acquisition.
Goodwill arising on both the NationsRent and Lux acquisitions reects the benets of the acquisitions arising to the Group not reected in the tangible and identiable intangible assets acquired.
In the case of NationsRent, this reects principally the operational synergies available post acquisition, the intrinsic value of the workforce and the increased opportunities available to Sunbelt as a result of its scale.
Similarly for Lux it reects the acquired workforce and the benets brought to A-Plants business of a leading position in the rental trafc systems market.
