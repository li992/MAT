Accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the current and preceding periods.

Rentals payable under leases for plant and machinery are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over the total lease term.
iii Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
This fair value is expensed in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest as adjusted for any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received from employees is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
