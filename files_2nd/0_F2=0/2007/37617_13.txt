In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account has not been presented for the Company.
There are no recognised gains and losses other than the result for the year, hence a statement of recognised gains and losses has not been presented.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or where it is more practical, an average rate for the week or month for all transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that week or month as long as the relevant exchange rates do not fluctuate significantly.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in other operating income and losses in the profit and loss account.
Subsidiary and associate undertakings The Companys shares in subsidiary and associate undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less provision for any impairment incurred.
Exchangeable bonds The Company has a contract with Forester Limited, a special purpose vehicle, which issued exchangeable bonds for the Companys own shares.
Under the terms of the contract between the Company and Forester Limited, the Company will issue a fixed number of shares for a fixed amount of consideration when bondholders exercise their conversion options.

Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments Although the Company does not incur a charge, the issuance by the Company to its subsidiaries of an award over the Companys shares represents additional capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries.
An additional investment in subsidiaries results with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the awards issued spread over the underlying awards vesting periods.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements, and directly in equity, in the period in which the dividend is paid or approved by the Companys shareholders, if required.
Dividends received from subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the period in which they are received.

Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the blalance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that it can be recovered.
The Company does not discount its deferred tax position as the effect would not be material.
Segmental reporting The Company being an investment holding company, only has one segment.

Warning to Shareholders Over the last year many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a connection to the company concerned.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way: many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports on the company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation and make a record of any other information they give you, e. g. telephone number, address etc.
Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved.
The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up-to-date and any other appropriate action can be considered.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
The FSA can, preferably, be contacted by completing an online form at www.
uk pages doing regulated law alerts overseas.
shtml or, if you do not have access to the internet, on 0845 606 1234.
They are not able to investigate such incidents themselves but will record the details and pass them on to Man Group plc and liaise with the FSA.
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found on the FSA website www.
