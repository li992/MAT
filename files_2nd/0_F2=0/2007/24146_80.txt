Contingent liabilities and commitments a Past sales The Group has made provision for the estimated cost of settling complaints in respect of past sales.
Although the provisions are regularly reviewed, the final outcome could be different from the provisions established as these costs cannot be calculated with certainty and are influenced by external factors beyond the control of management.
Such uncertainties include future regulatory actions, media attention and investment performance.
The majority of the uncertainty relates to endowment mortgages although a number of other products are being reviewed as an ongoing process.
It is expected that the majority of endowment cases requiring compensation will be settled in the next year.
b Operating leases where the Group is lessee The Group leases a number of properties under operating leases.
These leases typically run for a period of 50 years, with an option of renewal at the end of the lease.
Lease terms include annual escalation clauses to reflect current market conditions.
