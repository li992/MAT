Performance Share Plan The vesting of awards is subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee.
During the year the Remuneration Committee granted 110,204 ordinary shares of 10p each at nil value to the executive directors of the Company.
Following the 4:1 share split these converted to 440,816 ordinary shares of 2.5p each.
The vesting of these awards will be dependent on the Companys earnings per share performance over the three year period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009, with the following vesting schedule to apply: Companys EPS performance over the performance period % of award vesting Equal to less than RPI 18% 0% Equal to RPI 18% 25% Equal to RPI 45% or better 100% Between RPI 18% and RPI 45% Pro rata between 25% and 100% The BlackScholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: Share price on date of grant 5.07 Exercise price Nil Expected volatility using historic performance 50% Risk-free rate 5% Dividend 20.0p Expected percentage options exercised versus granted 100% Actual life 3 years Granted on 5 October 2007.
