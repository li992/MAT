Accounts Headlam Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
SEGMENT REPORTING The groups activities are wholly aligned to the sales, marketing, supply and distribution of floorcovering products.
These activities are carried out from business centres located in both the UK and Continental Europe.
The groups internal management structure and financial reporting systems treat the UK and Continental Europe as two separate segments because of the difference in reward arising from these two markets and this forms the basis for the geographical presentation of the primary segment information given below.
Unallocated assets comprise deferred tax assets.
Unallocated liabilities comprise income tax, deferred tax liabilities and employee benefits.
Management has access to information that provides details on sales and gross margin by principal product group and across the five principal business sectors which comprise Regional multi-product, National multi-product, Commercial regional, Residential specialist and Commercial specialist.
However, this information is not provided as a secondary segment since the groups operations are not managed by reference to these sub classifications and the presentation would require an arbitrary allocation of overheads, assets and liabilities undermining the presentations validity and usefulness.
