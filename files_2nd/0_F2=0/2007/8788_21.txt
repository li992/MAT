Segmental analysis Segmental information The primary segmental reporting format is determined to be the geographical segment according to the location of the asset.
The Directors consider the Group to have a single class of business, being the exploration for, development and production of oil and gas reserves.
Accordingly, no secondary segmental information is presented.
There are four geographic reporting segments.
The Ukraine and US are involved with production and exploration: the Rest of World are involved in exploration and the UK is the home of the head office.
The Rest of World segment comprises operations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Georgia and Turkey.
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between segments.
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

Additionally, the Group wrote off $7.1m relating to the Golitza B1 well in Bulgaria which was dry.
The Group previously recognised an impairment charge in respect of certain producing assets in Ukraine.
The impairment reflected uncertainty regarding the political and regulatory environment in Ukraine together with the relatively low Ukrainian oil and gas prices.
In 2006, following a step change in Ukrainian gas prices and easing of political and regulatory uncertainty, it was determined that the factors giving rise to the impairment have reversed and the impairment was reversed in 2006.
The amount of the reversal was determined by reference to the recoverable amount of the associated assets.
Recoverable amount was calculated based on expected future cash flows of the cash-generating unit discounted at a rate of 10%.
The cash generating unit is the Groups Novo-Nikolaevskoye complex in Ukraine.
Consideration was given to the amount of depreciation that would have been suffered in the period since the impairment charge was taken.
The carrying value was reinstated in 2006 at a value not higher than the carrying value had the impairment not been made.
The cost of inventories calculated by reference to production costs expensed in 2007 was $40.5m 2006: $34.5m.

Share-based payments Share options Share options are granted to Executive Directors and senior management based on performance criteria.
The scheme rules are described in the Directors Remuneration Report and repeated below.
All share-based payments are equity settled.
At 31 December 2007, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the years 2008 to 2017, to acquire 2,271,500 2006: 3,629,531 shares of the Company at prices ranging from 0.1675 to 3.83 per share 2006: 0.1675 to 3.83.
The vesting period of the options is three years, with an exercise period of seven years, making a 10-year maximum term.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.
2007 2006 Number WAEP Number WAEP Outstanding as at 1 January 3,629,531 89.47p 6,246,531 46.45p Granted during the year 367,000 298.00p 305,500 330.77p Exercised during the year 1,725,031 70.61p 2,922,500 22.76p Outstanding at 31 December 2,271,500 151.21p 3,629,531 89.47p Exercisable at 31 December 692,500 40.94p 479,031 20.80p Included within this balance are options over 396,531 2006: 2,471,531 shares for which an income statement expense has not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or before 7 November 2002.
These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of the options is 70.61 pence.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of the options is 22.76 pence.
For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2007, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.45 years 2006: 1.71 years.
During the year, share options were granted in accordance with the New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved Share Option Scheme collectively the New Share Option Schemes that were introduced in 2001.
They reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 the ABI Guidelines.
For the options to vest there has to be an increase in share price combined with a comparison to an external benchmark the Financial Times Stock Exchange Oil & Gas Producers Index FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index.
As a result of an increase in share price in the first quarter of 2006, the Company moved up into the FTSE 250 Index FTSE 250 and the benchmark was therefore reviewed and the Remuneration Committee decided that the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index was the most appropriate.
The Rules of the New Share Option Schemes address eligibility, timing of grants and exercise of options etc, and require that the shareholders are to be consulted if any substantive amendments to the Rules are required.
The Remuneration Committee Committee has discretion as to the application of the Rules of the New Share Option Schemes, particularly in the level of awards and the setting of the level of performance conditions.
Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 77 Notes to the accounts continued 26.
Share-based payments continued The Committee has prepared internal guidelines to enable it to administer the New Share Option Schemes.
In awarding share options the Committee takes into account the ABI Guidelines in terms of individual and collective limits, the need for demanding Performance Conditions etc, and other factors such as the performance of the Company and the individual in the previous 12 months, the effect of the vesting of grants awarded in previous years e. g. dilution, cost to the Company and the overall remuneration level annual salary, bonus award and benefits of the individual relative to the market.
Grants are made by reference to the market value mid-Market price of the Companys shares under option at the time of grant.
Executive Directors and employees are not required to pay for the grant of share options.
After three years the number of options that can be exercised is determined by two factors: 1 the actual increase in the Companys Share Price: and 2 a comparison of the actual increase in the share price to the change in the FTSE FI until the end of June 2004, FTSE SI until the end of February 2006 and the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index after that date.
The share price and FTSE factors will be multiplied together and the resultant figure will be applied to the number of options granted to an individual to determine the number of options to be vested.
The structure has been designed to introduce a sliding scale as distinct from a specific individual benchmark.
It will require the share price to double and this increase to be in the top quartile of the growth in the FTSE FI SI Oil & Gas Producers Index for all of the awards granted to an individual to determine the number of options that vest.
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee has determined that an option holder will only be able to exercise up to 50% of vested options at any one time and up to 50% after a period of 12 months, unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 58.8 pence 2006: 21.771 pence.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the standard binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the Companys share price directly.
The performance condition based on performance relative to other companies is modelled with a Monte Carlo model.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.
2007 2006 Dividend yield % 0.60 0.30 Historical volatility % 45.50 49.40 Expected share price volatility % 45.50 49.40 Risk-free interest rate % 5.10 4.73 Expected life of option years 4.75 3.50 Weighted average share price pence 151.21p 89.47p Bonus scheme The performance criteria of the Directors and senior employees bonus payments includes a component that relates directly to JKXs share performance over the vesting period and a component which relates to the performance of JKX share price in relation to the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index.
The full details of the bonus performance criteria are explained in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 45 and 46.
The bonus accrued for 2007 was $1.4m 2006: $1.4m and was paid in January 2008.
Capital commitments Under the programmes for the development and production of oil and gas reserves in Ukraine and Russia, the Group had committed $4.5m to future capital expenditure on drilling rigs and facilities at 31 December 2007 2006: $3.5m.

Business combination On 22 November 2007, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Yuzhgazenergie LLC, an oil and gas exploration and development company basin in Russia.
Glengary, held 25.15 per cent shareholding in JKX Oil & Gas plc at the date of acquisition.
As a related party transaction the acquisition was approved by the shareholders of JKX Oil & Gas plc at an Extraordinary General Meeting.
Disposal of Oklahoma assets In December 2003, JKX disposed of its Oklahoma assets for $8.8m.
The consideration was to be paid in two equal tranches of which $4.4m was paid in December 2003 and the balance was due December 2004.
In December 2004, JKX entered into a US Dollar loan agreement with Avalon Exploration Inc. which bore interest at 10% and was to recover principal and interest over a three-year period.
In February 2006, Avalon Exploration Inc. paid down the loan, including principal and interest.
Ukrainian and Russian business environment Ukraine and Russia display emerging market characteristics, and the legislation and business practices regarding banking operations, foreign currency transactions and taxation are constantly evolving as the governments attempt to manage the economies.
Risks inherent in conducting business in an emerging market economy include, but are not limited to, volatility in the financial markets and the general economy.
Uncertainties over the development of the tax and legal environment, as well as difficulties associated with the consistent interpretation and application of current laws and regulations, have continued.
As at 31 December 2007, oil and gas assets based in Ukraine and Russia represent approximately 66% and 28% respectively of the Groups oil and gas assets.
The Groups operations and financial position may be affected by these uncertainties.
The Groups financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability, and classification of assets or the amounts or classifications of liabilities that may result from these uncertainties.
