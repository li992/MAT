i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year against budget.
The current maximum award for each half-year amounts to 600,000 shares or a maximum annual award of 3,000 per employee if smaller.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against its budget.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award, otherwise the shares will be forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS Under the scheme, details of which are contained in the remuneration report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
A total of 1,645 employees received awards under this scheme during 2007.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2007 scheme is 964,000.
Individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Group's earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the same three-year period.
ADMIRAL GROUP plc 85 The range of awards is as follows: If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the remuneration report.
