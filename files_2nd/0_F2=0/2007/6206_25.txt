"46 Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 18 Issued capital and reserves continued Share capital in the consolidated balance sheet From a legal perspective, Foseco plc acquired Foseco Jersey Limited, but as Foseco Jersey Limited had the power to govern the financial and operating activities of its legal parent at the date of the acquisition, IFRS 3 states that the transaction must be accounted for as a ""reverse acquisition"", i. e. Foseco Jersey Limited is treated as if it had acquired Foseco plc, rather than vice versa."
This accounting treatment has the consequence that the balance sheet shows the share capital of Foseco Jersey Limited rather than the capital issued by Foseco plc.
The amounts recognised as issued capital in the consolidated financial statements has been determined by adding the issued capital of Foseco Jersey Limited immediately before the business combination to the cost of the combination.
However, the equity structure appearing in the consolidated financial statements i. e. the number and type of equity instruments issued, and the denominator in the earnings per share calculations reflects the equity structure of Foseco plc, including the equity instruments issued by Foseco plc to effect the business combination.
