Acquisitions 125. a Vimercate On 9 August 2007, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the voting equity in Europa Swan SARL, now SEGRO Lux Vimercate Vimercate, a company incorporated in Luxembourg, for 69.4 million.
Vimercate was previously part of the Europa Capital Group, and is owner of a business park at Vimercate, North East Milan, close to the A51 Eastern Milan bypass.
The Vimercate business park is in a well-established zone where many of the leading technology and communications sector businesses are based.
The Vimercate business park has potential for significant further development itself and is also adjacent to the keystone Torre Bianche mixed use development complex.
b Lyon On 10 August 2007, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the voting equity in Bowland SARL, a company registered in Luxembourg, for 30.2 million.
Bowland SARL was previously owned jointly by Longbow S. A. a subsidiary of Longbow plc and by the Apollo Real Estate Fund.
Bowland SARL owns a portfolio of warehousing and light industrial buildings close to Lyon airport at St. Exupry.
The acquisition of the Lyon portfolio gives the Group an immediate presence in the main area for logistics premises in the Lyon region, with the potential benefit of further-improved transport links over the medium term.
The portfolio is of higher than average quality for the French provinces, for which the trend of occupier demand relative to present supply is indicated as encouraging.
The acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
For Lyon, it was considered on reassessment that the goodwill that had arisen on acquisition had no value and therefore it was written off to the income statement.
For Vimercate, negative goodwill arose on acquisition which has been immediately credited to the income statement and is included within property operating expenses.
Details of the book values and the fair values of the assets and liabilities at the dates of the acquisitions, after making the necessary adjustments described above, are summarised as follows: Book values Book values Fair value Fair Lyon Vimercate adjustment value m m m m Non-current assets investment properties 14.3 45.5 37.4 97.2 Other current assets 0.4 0.4 Deferred tax liability 8.9 8.9 Receivables 1.3 9.0 10.3 Cash 0.4 3.4 3.8 Current liabilities falling due within one year 0.9 1.4 2.3 Net assets at date of acquisition 15.1 56.9 28.5 100.5 Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions, net 0.9 Total consideration 99.6 Estimates have been applied in arriving at certain costs relating to the acquisition and therefore the goodwill has been ermined provisionally at 31 December 2007. det SEGRO.
