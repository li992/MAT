Due to the fact that these amendments were not substantively enacted as at 31 December 2007, their effects have not been reflected within the Groups results.
The directors have estimated that should these amendments be substantively enacted during the year ending 31 December 2008, the deferred tax liability held in the consolidated balance sheet would increase by 6.5 million with a corresponding charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
