Deferred consideration which was expected to be paid was accrued in respect of acquisitions made in 2006 and prior years amounting to 9.1m.
The impact of this was to increase goodwill by the same amount.
As required by IAS 12 deferred taxation is calculated on intangible assets recognised as a result of an acquisition, the impact of this was to increase goodwill in 2006 by 2.6m and to create a deferred tax liability of the same amount.
As a result of the above, total goodwill of 39.3m was recognised in 2006.
Acquisitions in 2006 included the Sinclair Henderson group of companies, Ruddle Wilkinson Limited, Synaptic Systems Limited, Webline Limited now known as Capita Financial Software Limited, Stirling Trustees Limited and Two Ten Communications Limited.
The performance of these acquisitions post their inclusion in the Group could not be ascertained as they had been fully integrated within existing offerings.
Within goodwill there were certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquirees and could not be measured reliably.
These items included customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
