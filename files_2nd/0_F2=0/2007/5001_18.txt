The secondary format is geographical segments showing the geographical origin of the Groups activity and net assets.
Further details on these business segments are given in the Business Review on pages 15 to 25.
The Group operates in two principal geographical areas: the UK and western continental Europe.
Two further segments are identified: eastern continental Europe and the rest of the world.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-onyear.
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level.
Capital employed excludes items of a financing nature, taxation balances, pension liabilities and fixed asset investments: segmental capital employed comprises identifiable segment assets less segmental liabilities.
Average capital employed is the average monthly capital employed.
The adjusted return on average capital employed is defined as operating profit before exceptional items divided by average capital employed.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following segments have cash-generating units containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2007 2006 m m UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 140.6 140.3 Plastic Packaging 31.8 31.7 172.4 172.0 Segments with no cash-generating units containing individually significant goodwill 5.7 5.8 178.1 177.8 As set out in accounting policy i in note 1, the Group tests its goodwill for potential impairment annually.
The recoverable amount of the Groups cashgenerating units is calculated on the present value of their respective expected future cash flows the value-in-use or the net selling price fair value, if greater.
Given the limited available information on the likely fair value of the Groups assets, the recoverable amount used is predominately the value-in-use.
The value-in-use calculations use a pre-tax discount rate of 10.6%, derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, and discount a five-year period with a terminal value.
The cash flows included in the value-in-use are based for the forthcoming and subsequent financial years on the Groups Plan approved by the Board of Directors: subsequent years cash flows are based on estimates of future performance.
The key assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: long-term sales growth up to 3.0%: capital expenditure equal to annual depreciation: and nominal growth in profit at terminal value up to 3.0%.

During the year, Rubezhansk acquired and then subsequently cancelled 20% of its share capital: as a consequence of this and the purchase of 1.1% of the reduced share capital, the Group increased its holding in Rubezhansk to 49.6%.
The acquisition by Rubezhansk of the 20% shareholding was made at a discount to the underlying net asset amount.
As a consequence, negative goodwill of 2.0m arose on DS Smith Plcs shareholding, which has been treated as exceptional in the income statement see note 4.
During the year the Group sold 8.5% of Tri-Wall KK shares, reducing its holding to 6.3%.
The Group retains significant influence over Tri-Wall KK through representation on the Board of Directors and active participation in policy-making processes.

In addition, swap counterparties also agreed to pay fixed-rate dollar interest of 6.24% per annum on a principal amount of $25m in exchange for floating dollar interest linked to dollar LIBOR and fixed-rate sterling interest of 6.85% per annum on a principal of 25m in exchange for floating sterling interest linked to sterling LIBOR.
In August 2004, the Group entered into a further note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of DS Smiths 5.66% senior notes and US$95m of 5.80% senior notes, which will mature on 25 August 2014 and 25 August 2016, respectively.
The Group entered into swap transactions with a bank counterparty under which it made payments of US$105m and US$20m in return for 86.5m and 16.5m, respectively, and a payment of $75m in return for 40.8m.
The swap counterparty agreed to pay fixed-rate dollar interest of 5.66% per annum and 5.80% per annum, respectively, in exchange for floating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR and fixed-rate dollar interest of 5.80% per annum in exchange for fixed-rate sterling interest at rates of 6.21% per annum.

Financial instruments The summary of the Groups key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Risk Management sections of the Business Review on pages 26 to 32.
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into to help achieve the Groups risk management objectives.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and commodity risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the financing of these activities.
The assets and liabilities as at 30 April 2007 in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m m m Derivatives held to Manage the Groups exposure to foreign exchange exposure on foreign currency investments 7.4 9.7 7.4 9.7 Manage the interest rate and currency exposures on borrowings 0.2 0.8 23.1 15.2 22.9 14.4 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 0.2 0.8 30.5 24.9 30.3 24.1 Derivatives held to Hedge future transactions energy costs 0.7 4.3 2.6 1.9 1.9 2.4 Hedge future transactions foreign exchange on purchases and sales of goods and services 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.2 Total derivative financial instruments 0.9 5.1 33.4 27.0 32.5 21.9 Current 0.7 3.7 1.7 2.0 1.0 1.7 Non-current 0.2 1.4 31.7 25.0 31.5 23.6 0.9 5.1 33.4 27.0 32.5 21.9 i Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currency of which differs from the Groups presentational currency.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps.
ii Interest rate and currency risk on borrowings The Groups policy on interest rate risk is designed to reduce the Groups exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges, to swap fixed-rate debt into floating-rates, and as cash flow hedges, to swap floating-rate debt into fixed-rates.
The Group is exposed to currency risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges part of this exposure through cross-currency swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
0.1m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges.
This will be recycled to the income statement with the underlying hedged interest, which will occur over periods to 2016. iii Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to price risk on energy purchases.
Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
1.3m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges.
This will be recycled to the income statement with the underlying hedged transactions, which occur within two years.
iv Foreign exchange risk on transactions The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk where a business unit makes product sales and materials purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges, resulting in 0.1m net of tax being deferred in equity.
v Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk and does not enter into financial instruments to manage credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.

Financial instruments continued vi Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arms-length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value the note purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only the portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which bear floating-rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
For current and non-current receivables note 15 and current and non-current payables note 16 and provisions note 22 fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value and is not included in the table below.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items: Assets Liabilities Net 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 72.7 70.5 72.3 70.5 Employee benefits including pensions 7.1 16.1 7.1 16.1 Other items 14.3 7.9 8.7 5.8 5.2 2.1 Tax assets liabilities 21.4 24.0 81.4 76.3 60.0 52.3 Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been recognised in respect of the following items: Assets Liabilities 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Tax losses 3.3 6.4 Unremitted earnings of overseas operations 4.7 4.3 Total 3.3 6.4 4.7 4.3 The tax losses above do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been provided for in respect of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as there is no current intention for any of the relevant overseas entities to remit their earnings.

At 30 April 2007 deferred tax assets were recognised for all taxable temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses except where it is unlikely that taxable profit will be available against which to offset the loss.
In March 2007, the UK government announced an intention to amend UK tax legislation to reduce the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% from 1 April 2008 and also to remove tax depreciation on UK industrial buildings from 2011 onwards.
At 30 April 2007 these changes in legislation had not been substantively enacted and therefore the UK tax rate applied for the purposes of the measurement of the Groups deferred tax in the Annual Report is 30% and no amendment to deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to certain UK buildings.
Had the legislation been substantively enacted on 30 April 2007, the Group estimates its net deferred tax provision would have increased from 60.0m to 73.0m.

In respect of the Companys shares that are held by the Group see below, all rights are suspended until those shares are reissued.
A reconciliation of the movement in share capital is given in note 9 to the Company balance sheet on page 97.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Own shares The reserve for the Companys own shares comprises the cost of the Companys shares held by the Group.
The Group operates a General Employee Benefit Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Executive Share Option scheme, the Restricted Share Plan discontinued in 2004 and the Long-Term Incentive Plan established in 2004.
At 30 April 2007, the Trust held 1.9m shares 2006: 2.6m shares.
The market value of the shares at 30 April 2007 was 4.6m 2006: 3.9m.
Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Minority interest The non-controlling shareholders of one subsidiary in respect of which a minority interest is recognised in these financial statements have an option to put their shareholding to the DS Smith Group.
On the exercise of this put option, the purchase price of the shares will be calculated by reference to the recent profitability of the subsidiary involved, using a multiple-based formula.
During the current financial year, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC clarified the accounting treatment to be adopted in circumstances such as these.
Accordingly, a liability of 12.3m has been recognised and a corresponding entry has been recorded against minority interest, as shown in the table on page 83.
Post-retirement benefits Liability for defined benefit obligations During 2006 07 the Group operated two funded, defined benefit schemes in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme the Group scheme and the DS Smith Containers scheme the Containers scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the Containers scheme were transferred to the Group scheme on 30 April 2007, with the effect that only the Group scheme operates from 1 May 2007.
The Group made agreed annual contributions of 14.0m to the Group scheme in 2006 07 2005 06: 14.0m and contributions of 0.6m to the Containers scheme 2005 06: 0.6m.
Future contributions will be in part dependent on the results of the triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 30 April 2007 and related discussions between the Group and the combined schemes trustees.
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these are, in aggregate, not significant to the Group.
The financial information given on pages 85 and 86 includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was as at 5 April 2004, which has been updated to 30 April 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Containers scheme was valued in 2004 and this valuation has been updated to 30 April 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.
All valuations used the projected unit method.
Both the Group scheme and the Containers scheme are closed to new entrants.
Because of this, the average age of the active members is likely to increase at future valuations and this will lead to an increasing current service contribution rate: this may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary resulting from leavers and retirements.

Using these tables, a male member currently aged 40 is expected to live for a further 43.2 years, while a male pensioner aged 65 is expected to live for a further 16.9 years.
The tables above have been used as at 30 April 2007 and 30 April 2006 and reflect published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the consideration of the mortality experience of scheme members.

Share-based payment expense The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: i An Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS is operated for Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Approved and unapproved options are granted to UK and overseas executives on a phased basis.
The vesting of any options granted under this Scheme is subject to the achievement of longterm performance conditions, being that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three-year period following grant.
The base financial year for the purposes of measuring earnings per share growth will be the financial year prior to the grant date.
Normally, no part of the option will vest unless the long-term performance conditions have been achieved and the vesting period of three years service has been attained.
ii In the past, Executive Directors and other senior executives received an award of shares in the Company equal in value to the participants annual cash bonus, pursuant to a Restricted Share Plan RSP.
The award of these shares is dependent upon performance in the relevant financial year.
There is a vesting period of three years service.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2004. iii In September 2004, the Group established a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The key features of the plan are that: awards will be made to selected Executive Directors and other senior executives over shares in the Company: performance will be measured over a single period of three financial years: awards will vest based on the Companys total shareholder return being the increase in share price and the value of reinvested dividends compared to a comparator group of companies, being the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts for initial awards: if the Companys total shareholder return is ranked in the upper quartile of the comparator group or higher, the full award will vest, reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance: and additionally, no awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Companys earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three year period.
During the year, awards totalling 1,520,663 shares were made to participating executives under the LTIP.
At 30 April 2007, the total number of shares awarded and outstanding under the LTIP was 3,987,241 2006: 2,929,312.
