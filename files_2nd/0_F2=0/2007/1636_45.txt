indd 38 07 06 2007 13:54:32 AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2007 Financial statements IFRS Share options have been granted under both plans to certain employees of the Group and remain outstanding as follows: Number Number of options of options Exercise Date of grant Share option plan 2007 2006 price p 30 March 2000 Employee Scheme 3,600 26,700 114.17 19 January 2001 Employee Scheme 14,802 174.90 19 January 2001 Executive Scheme 524,598 174.90 12 July 2001 Employee Scheme 34,350 90,768 159.83 12 July 2001 Executive Scheme 120,732 120,732 159.83 1 July 2004 LTIP 90,000 90,000 3.33 20 July 2005 Employee Scheme 11,304 11,304 265.33 20 July 2005 Executive Scheme 244,227 244,227 265.33 28 June 2006 LTIP 78,648 3.33 582,861 1,123,131 These options are normally exercisable in full or in part between the 3rd and 7th anniversaries of the date of grant.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2007 is 3.2 years 2006 3.2 years.
The average fair value of options granted during the year was 3.53 2006 0.89.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 0.03 to 2.65 2006 0.03 to 2.65.
The Group recognised total expenses of 177,000 and 84,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the years ended 31 March 2007 and 2006 respectively.
Details of the share option plans are as follows: a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP On 28 June 2006 a total of 78,648 share options were granted under the AVEVA Group plc LTIP.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 3.33p.
These options are subject to performance conditions which are based on average growth in earnings per share achieved over the 3 years from 200607 to 200809.
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2007: 2007 Dividend yield 0.60% Expected volatility 31.90% Risk-free interest rate 4.89% Expected life of the option 3 years Weighted average share price 3.62 Weighted average exercise price 0.03 A total of 90,000 share options were granted under the LTIP to certain senior executives on 1 July 2004.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the nominal value of the underlying ordinary shares, which is 3.33p.
The extent to which the options are exercisable will depend on the ranking of the Company in terms of total shareholder return measured against other companies in the London Stock Exchange techMARK 100 index.
The performance conditions will be measured 3 years from the date of grant and there is no allowance for retesting.
The contractual life of each option granted is 7 years and the options become exercisable 3 years after the date of grant.
The options lapse if the option holder leaves the employment of the Group with certain specic exceptions.
The options vest in accordance with the following scale: Total shareholder return ranking Percentage vesting of shares subject to option 75% and above 100% Median to 75% Pro rata on a straight line basis Median 33% Below median Nil 61 1 AVV ar07 back.

The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2005: 2005 Dividend yield 1.23% Expected volatility 30.0% Risk-free interest rate 5.09% Expected life of the option 3 years Weighted average share price 1.83 Weighted average exercise price 0.03 b Employee and executive share option plan Options have also been granted under the AVEVA Group plc Employee Share Option Scheme and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
Pre-2004 grants The options are normally exercisable in full or in part between the 3rd and 7th anniversaries of the date of grant.
The options will lapse if not exercised by the 7th anniversary from the date of grant.
All options are subject to performance conditions, which require earnings per share to outperform RPI utilisation by a total of 10% over a 3 year rolling period.
The share option rules were established at the time of the Companys initial public offering in 1996 and the performance conditions set were commonly used at that time.
2005 grants On 20 July 2005, a total of 255,531 options under the AVEVA Group plc Executive and Employee Share Option schemes were awarded.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option would be that Earnings per Share EPS in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2006.
2006 Dividend yield 0.90% Expected volatility 33.44% Risk-free interest rate 4.21% Expected life of the option 5 years Weighted average share price 2.65 Weighted average exercise price 2.65 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
