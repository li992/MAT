Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Company financial statements.
a Basis of preparation Group and Company The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
Based on these adopted IFRS, the directors have made assumptions about the accounting policies expected to be applied, which are set out below.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
c Foreign currency translation i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
d Financial instruments i Derivatives The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its foreign currency exposures.
Derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is entered into unless fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised.
Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is negative.
ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 45 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued d Financial instruments continued ii Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs.
The fair value on acquisition is normally the cost.
Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the income statement when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables is impaired.
However, if a longer-term loan or receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts discounted using the prevailing market rates.
The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or interest income.
Subsequent to initial recognition these assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment includes leasehold improvement and office equipment.
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The useful lives are estimated to be five years.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.
f Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
g Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
h Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
46 ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 1 Significant accounting policies continued i Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.
j Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
k Share-based payments The Group issues share options to its employees under the share option plans.
The awards have been classified as equity-settled under IFRS 2.
The fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes formula, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
l Own shares Own shares are held by an Employee Benefit Trust EBT which acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share option plan.
The holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group.
Own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings.
m Revenue Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement as and when the related services are provided.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Specific revenue recognition policies are: i Management fees Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Where management fees are received in advance these are recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on experience of average holding periods for investments.
ii Performance fees Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise.
This is usually at the end of the performance period.
iii Other revenue Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the Group.
This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.
Other revenue also includes foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of transactions in foreign currencies.
The accounting policy on foreign currency translation is described in note 1 c. n Distribution costs Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.
ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 47 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued o Operating leases Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded in other operating income.
p Interest income and interest expense Interest income and expense are calculated using an effective interest rate method.
Interest income comprises interest receivable on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, and on funds invested.
Interest expense comprises interest payable on trade and other payables.
q Taxation i Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
r Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Currently, management consider that the Groups services comprise one business segment being provision of investment management services and that it operates in a market that is not geographically segmented.
48 ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 1 Significant accounting policies continued s Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following IFRS endorsed by the EU were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements: IFRS 7: Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 10: Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11: IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007. t Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 24. u Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee or that guarantee expires for any reason.
Company In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company.
Investment in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with a further adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
There is no difference between the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2007 2006 Weighted average number of ordinary shares used in calculation of basic earnings per share 667,467,808 660,200,000 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 38,827,815 26,859,915 Weighted average number of ordinary shares used in calculation of diluted earnings per share 706,295,623 687,059,915 7 Share-based payments Group and Company share-based compensation plans The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during the reporting year.
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme EMI Scheme The Group issued share options through its EMI Scheme in October 2000.
As at June 2004 all options held under the scheme were exercised.
The shares held as a result of exercising EMI options were accounted for on a cash settled basis up until 28 April 2006 when the policy was changed to equity settled.
The EMI Scheme is no longer operative and there are no options outstanding under this scheme.
The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme Option Scheme The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000.
Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years and vest after five years from date of grant.
The fair value of options at each reporting year end have been accounted for on a cash settled basis up until 28 April 2006, and on an equity-settled basis thereafter.
No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan Omnibus Plan The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Companys IPO in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options and or nil cost options.
The Omnibus Plan will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares.
These elements can be used singly or in combination.
It is intended they will be complementary and ensure that any cyclical fluctuations do not have an excessively adverse effect on employee remuneration in circumstances where the Group has performed well.
The Approved Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Companys IPO in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value options to selected employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding 30,000 per employee.
The CSOP qualifies as a UK tax approved company share option plan and approval has been obtained from HMRC.
As at 30 June 2007 there have been no awards made under the CSOP.

Therefore, volatility has been calculated for options granted in the period by taking the average of the historic volatility of four of the Companys quoted peers over the preceding four-year period.
The average volatility of these four quoted peers as on each reporting date is considered as the long-term mean and used for valuing options.
Peers selected were public quoted fund management companies which were considered to offer suitable coverage in terms of business mix to be a reasonable proxy for volatility for the Company.
8 Dividends An analysis of dividends paid is as follows: Group and Company Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2007 2006 Interim dividend 15.5m 55.0m Dividend per share 2.30p 8.33p Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when approved by the shareholders.
On 12 September 2007 the board proposed a final dividend of 6.7p per share for the year ended 30 June 2007.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be 44.7m.
ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 55 Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Intangible assets goodwill Group and Company The goodwill balance of 4.1m 2006: 4.1m relates to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.
An annual impairment review of goodwill has been undertaken.
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit and therefore no further split into smaller cash generating units is possible.
Therefore, impairment testing of goodwill is carried out for the Group as a whole.
The recoverable amounts of the business are determined based on future forecast profitability and cash flow projections.
The key assumptions on which management has based their projections are the expected fund flows and growth of AuM, which determine management and performance fee income.
There has been no gross impairment to date and no movement in goodwill.
10 Fair value of financial instruments There is no material difference between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to published price quotations.
11 Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk management relates to risk to the Group in respect of its own assets and liabilities.
The Group has limited exposure to financial instruments in respect of its own assets and liabilities.
They include forward foreign exchange contracts, cash deposits and trade receivables and payables.
The main risks arising from financial instruments are foreign currency risk, exposure to interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below.
Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
Effective interest rates applicable to financial instruments are as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2007 2006 % % Deposits with banks 5.57 5.28 As at As at 30 June 30 June 2007 2006 m m Items repricing within one year or less: Deposits with banks 218.0 132.7 Items repricing in more than one year but not more than two years: Loans included within Trade and other receivables 0.1 3.6 56 ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 11 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk It is the Groups policy to ensure that it has sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12 months.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
The Groups business is impacted through its exposure to fee income being principally US dollars while its cost base is largely sterling denominated.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to mitigate exposure to foreign currency risk where it is considered that the sterling values of such amounts are at risk.
The use of such instruments is limited and is subject to approval by the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition to foreign currency fee revenue, the Group has a foreign currency exposure in respect of bank account balances held in US dollars.
The financial effect of the realised and unrealised hedging gains during the year and the impact of the movement of the foreign exchange rates on the Groups non-sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities is shown in note 2.
At 30 June 2007 forward contracts totalling US$30m were outstanding with a maturity profile of less than one year 30 June 2006: US$90m.
Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
The Groups principal exposure to credit risk arises from default of an investment management client in respect of fees due and banks in respect of deposits and derivative positions.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
Bank deposits are liquid short-term deposits with banks which have credit ratings ranging from A to AA.
