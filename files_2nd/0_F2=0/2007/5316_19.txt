The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2004 and has been updated to 31 March 2007 by a qualied independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The deficit on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the deficit has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd as it is not possible to do so.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc part of it.
