Deferred tax assets not recognised on the balance sheet are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Revenue losses 24.8 24.9 Other 12.3 14.6 Total potential deferred tax assets not recognised 37.1 39.5 In addition to the above, the Group has surplus UK Advance CorporationTax carried forward of 12.6m 2006: 12.6m which is not recognised.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 458.2m 2006: 352.3m.
