The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that 3.6m of the provision will be utilised in 2008, 1.4m in 2009 and the remaining balance of 6.7m utilised from 2010 onwards.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a rate of 6.0% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning & remediation obligations relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment.
The provisions reflect uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
The provisions, which have been discounted at rates of between 4% to 7.5%, are expected to be utilised over a period of 12 to 42 years.
The Group expects the other provision of 0.9m to be fully utilised in 2008.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit plan was closed to new UK employees who are now offered membership of the defined contribution plan.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
Pensions arrangements are also in place for most overseas employees, principally in the form of money purchase plans.
During the year, the trustees of the UK scheme with support of the Company, purchased annuity policies in relation to the pensioners and deferred pensioners of the scheme.
These annuity policies fully insure 141.0m of the UK schemes obligations at 31 December 2007.
The movement in the value of the asset matches exactly the movement in the liability at each balance sheet date and thus significantly reduces the risk within the UK pension scheme.
The effect of this is recognised in actuarial losses on plan assets in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Valuations of the defined benefit plans are produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.
