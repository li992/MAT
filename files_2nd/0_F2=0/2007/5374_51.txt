The principal funds are four UK pension schemes, one defined contribution and three defined benefit.
In all cases, the assets of the schemes are held by independent custodians and are kept entirely separate from the assets of the Group.
No loans have been made by any scheme to any Group company and no shareholdings of the schemes have been used as security for any loans to any Group company.
i Defined contribution plan Flexiplan The pension charge for Flexiplan represents contributions due from the employer.
During the year it amounted to 5.2m 2006: 4.6m with 0.4m 2006: 0.4m outstanding at the year end.
ii Defined benefit plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees in the UK, the principal schemes being the Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP and the Scottish Radio Holdings Pension Scheme SRH in the UK.
Under the scheme rules, participants are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0% and 67% of final salary on the attainment of retirement age.
All schemes are closed to new participants.
In July 2006 the Group accelerated funding of 6m into the SRH scheme which fully funded the scheme on an IAS 19 Employee Benefits basis at that time.
The Group intends to fully fund the IAS 19 deficits in existence at 31 March 2007 by the next triennial actuarial valuations.
The pension charge for the year for all schemes for continuing operations was 0.5m 2006: 0.8m and for discontinued was nil 2006: 0.3m.
