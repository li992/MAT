Notes to the regulatory accounting statements 1.
Adoption of new accounting standards New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations adopted in 2006 07 During the year ended 31 March 2007, National Grid Gas has adopted the following amendments to standards and interpretations.
None of these had a material impact on consolidated results or assets and liabilities.
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease provides guidance on determining whether arrangements which convey the right to use an asset in return for a series of payments should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds addresses the issues of how a contributor to such a fund should account for its interest in the fund and how obligations to make additional contributions should be accounted for.
IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment relates to the European Unions Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, which deals with the responsibility of producers for the backlog of waste for goods sold to private households.
IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies deals with what is meant by the phrase measuring unit current at the balance sheet date and also with how an entity accounts for opening deferred tax items in its restated financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: The Fair Value Option restricts the ability of entities to designate financial assets and liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss to those financial instruments that meet certain specified conditions.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Financial Guarantee Contracts define a financial guarantee contract and specify which accounting standard will apply to such contracts.
Generally, financial guarantee contracts are within the scope of IAS 39.
However, where the issuer of a financial guarantee contract has previously asserted that it regards such contracts as insurance contracts, then they may elect to apply either IAS 39 or IFRS 4 to those contracts.
The Company accounts for such contracts as insurance contracts.
Amendment to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates clarifies the requirements of IAS 21 regarding an entitys investment in foreign operations and, in particular, the treatment of monetary items entered into as net investment hedges.
New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted National Grid Gas has yet to adopt the following standards and interpretations.
These will be adopted on 1 April 2007, but are not expected to have a material impact on consolidated results or assets and liabilities.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 addresses the issue of whether IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment applies to transactions in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives prohibits reassessment of the treatment of embedded derivatives subsequent to initial recognition unless there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the contract, in which case reassessment is required.
IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment states that any impairment losses on goodwill and certain financial assets recognised in an interim financial statement may not be reversed in subsequent interim or annual financial statements.
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving subsidiary undertakings for instance, options over a parents shares should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet endorsed by the EU IFRS 8 Operating segments sets out the requirements for the disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments and about the entitys products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates and its major customers.
IFRS 8 achieves convergence with the US accounting standard, FAS 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information with minor differences.
If this standard had been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2007, it is not expected that it would have had a material impact on consolidated results or the presentation of those results.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing costs removes the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
Implementation of this amendment is not expected to have any impact on consolidated results or consolidated assets and liabilities as National Grid Gass accounting policy is to capitalise borrowing costs.
IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services, for example, under private finance initiative contracts PFI contracts.
The impact of this interpretation on consolidated results or consolidated assets and liabilities has not yet been assessed.

Reconciliation to the annual report and accounts of National Grid Gas plc continued Sold DNs represent the results, assets and liabilities attributed to the four DNs sold by National Grid Gas on 1 June 2005.
Further details of these sales are provided in the National Grid Gas Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06.
These sold DNs are not presented as discontinued operations within these regulatory accounting statements, as they each hold their own separate gas transporter licence and are not within the scope of the gas transporter licence under which these regulatory accounting statements are prepared.
The regulatory accounting statements for each of these four sold DNs are not prepared by National Grid Gas.

Exceptional items and remeasurements Exceptional items and remeasurements are items of income and expenditure that, in the judgement of management, should be disclosed separately on the basis that they are material, either by their nature or their size, to an understanding of National Grid Gass financial performance and significantly distort the comparability of financial performance between periods.
Items of income or expense that are considered by management for designation as exceptional items include such items as significant restructurings, write-downs or impairments of non-current assets, material changes in environmental provisions and gains or losses on disposals of businesses or investments.
Remeasurements comprise gains or losses recorded in the income statement arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to the extent that hedge accounting is not achieved or is not effective.

Payroll costs and employees continued d Share option and award schemes National Grid operates three principal forms of share option and award plans in which National Grid Gass employees and Directors participate.
These are an employee Sharesave scheme, a Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Share Plan.
In addition, there are two historical plans under which awards are outstanding, but no further awards are being granted.
These are the Executive Plan and the Share Matching Plan.
Information on these schemes is only available for National Grid Gas as a whole and not in respect of the businesses and activities included in these regulatory accounting statements.
The information in respect of National Grid Gas can be found in its annual report and accounts, available from the Company Secretary, 1-3 Strand, London WC2N 5EH.
Directors emoluments The businesses reported in these regulatory accounting statements are not entities with statutory Directors.
Accordingly, there are no relevant Directors emoluments.
Details of the emoluments of the Directors of National Grid Gas are provided in the Directors report on page 33.
Pensions Substantially all National Grid Gass employees are members of the defined benefit section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme the scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to National Grid Gas.
Accordingly, National Grid Gas accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme provides final salary defined benefits for employees who joined prior to 31 March 2002 and defined contribution benefits for employees joining from 1 April 2002.
The scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
It is subject to independent actuarial valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contribution, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP at 31 March 2006.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was 12,743m and the value of the assets represented approximately 97% of the actuarial value of benefits due to members, calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2006 on an ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.
There was a funding deficit of 371m on the valuation date.
The results of the actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2006 showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 32% of pensionable earnings 29% employers and 3% employees.
The ongoing contribution rate does not include an allowance for administration expenses.
These contributions are reviewed annually.
From 1 April 2007, the rate used for the recovery of administration costs was 3.7% of salary.
Employers are currently, therefore, paying a total contribution rate of 32.7%.
In line with the agreement made after the 2003 valuation, no funding of the deficit identified in the 2006 actuarial valuation will need to be provided to the scheme until the outcome of the actuarial assessment at 31 March 2007 is known.
At this point, National Grid will pay the gross amount of any deficit up to a maximum amount of 520m 364m net of tax into the scheme.
Until the 31 March 2007 actuarial valuation has been completed, National Grid has arranged for banks to provide the trustees of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme with letters of credit.
The main conditions under which these letters of credit could be drawn relate to events that would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as National Grid Gas plc becoming insolvent or National Grid failing to make agreed payments into the scheme.
The following disclosures relate to the scheme as a whole and include amounts not recognised in these regulatory accounting statements, but which are recognised in the accounts of National Grid plc.

ii A promotional age related scale has been used where appropriate.
iii The assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The assumed life expectations for a retiree at age 65 are as follows: Years Today: Males 20.0 Females 22.3 In 20 years: Males 21.2 Females 23.4 Sensitivities at 31 March 2007 all other assumptions held constant: A 0.1% reduction in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the pension and other post-retirement obligation of 200m and an increase in the annual pension cost of 2m.
A 0.5% increase in the long-term rate of increase in salaries would lead to an increase in the pension and other post-retirement obligation of 78m and an increase in the annual pension cost of 2m.
An increase of one year to life expectations at age 60 would lead to an increase in the pension and other post-retirement obligation of 403m and to an increase in the annual pension cost of 2m.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the plan.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the schemes actuaries.
The long-term target asset allocation for the scheme is 36% equities, 56% bonds and 8% property and other.
National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory Accounting Statements 2006 07 57 9.

Interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprises interest on bank loans and overdrafts 8m 2006: 10m and interest on other borrowings 177m 2006: 154m.
Interest on the funding attributable to assets in the course of construction was capitalised during the year at a rate of 5.9% 2006: 6.0%.
Derivative net gains on fair value hedges includes a net loss on the hedging instruments of 22m 2006: 9m net loss offset by a net gain of 28m 2006: 1m net loss from the fair value adjustments to the carrying value of debt.
ii The deferred tax charge includes a charge relating to prior years of nil 2006: deferred tax credit of 7m before exceptional items and remeasurements and 4m 2006: deferred tax credit of 7m after exceptional items and remeasurements respectively.
The 2006 amount includes a current year credit relating to exceptional items and remeasurements of 4m.
iii The overseas corporate tax charge of 4m relates to exceptional items and remeasurements 2006: credit of 1m relating to exceptional items and remeasurements.

The effect of the changes subsequently enacted in the 2007 Finance Act has not yet been fully determined, but is expected to reduce the allocated deferred tax liability provided at 31 March 2007 by approximately 86m in the year ending 31 March 2008 and increase profit for the year by the same amount.
The estimated impact on deferred tax on other recognised gains and losses included in equity is not expected to be significant.
This decrease in deferred tax is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent with effect from 1 April 2008.
The impact of other announced changes to the UK Corporation Tax system has not yet been assessed.

Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities and equity or other indices.
Derivatives enable their users to alter exposure to market or credit risks.
National Grid Gas uses derivatives to manage both treasury and operational market risks.
Derivatives are carried at fair value and are shown in the balance sheet as separate totals of assets and liabilities.
Asset values represent the cost of replacing all transactions with a fair value in our favour assuming that all relevant counterparties default at the same time, and that the transactions can be replaced immediately in the market.
Liability values represent the cost to counterparties of replacing all their transactions with a fair value in their favour in the case of default.
Derivative assets and liabilities on different transactions are only netted if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of set-off exists and the cash flows are intended to be settled on a net basis.
Treasury financial instruments Derivatives are used for hedging purposes in the management of exposure to market risks.
This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from the maturity and other profiles of National Grid Gass assets and liabilities.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained in note 18.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
These are described as follows: 68 National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory Accounting Statements 2006 07 17.
Derivative financial instruments continued Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the hedging period.
Cash flow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained to manage this exposure, and designated as cash flow hedges, where they qualify.
Fair value changes on designated cash flow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash flow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship National Grid Gass policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement within interest expense and other finance costs.
Operational financial instruments Commodity derivatives are used to manage commodity prices associated with gas distribution operations.
As these contracts are for normal usage in our operations and are not settled net, they are carried at cost and are recognised within trade receivables or payables as appropriate.

Derivative financial instruments continued The following information on derivative financial instruments largely comprises a simple apportionment of such information in respect of National Grid Gas plc as reported in its annual report and accounts.
Accordingly, disclosures are only provided in total and not by regulatory business.
National Grid Gass use of derivatives may entail a derivative transaction qualifying for one or more hedge type designations under IAS 39.

Financial risk factors National Grid Gass activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of National Grid plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units.
The National Grid plc Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity as discussed further in National Grid Gass treasury policy, described on pages 23 to 25.
The information provided below in respect of financial risk factors includes financial amounts which are simple apportionments of such amounts in respect of National Grid Gas plc, as reported in its annual report and accounts.
a Market risk Foreign exchange risk National Grid Gas raises finance in various currencies and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from related currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.
With respect to near term foreign exchange risk, National Grid Gas uses foreign exchange forwards to manage foreign exchange transaction exposure.
Its policy is to hedge a minimum percentage of known contracted foreign currency flows in the period out to six months and also in the period six to twelve months in order to mitigate foreign currency movements in the intervening period.
Where cash forecasts are uncertain, National Grid Gas generally covers a percentage of the foreign currency flows depending on the certainty of the cash flows.
During 2007 and 2006, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: 2007 2006 Sterling Euro US dollar Other Total Sterling Euro US dollar Other Total m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 113 - - - 113 156 - - - 156 Financial investments 247 - - - 247 29 - - - 29 Bank overdrafts 4 - - - 4 -- -- - Borrowings 3,006 161 315 218 3,700 1,380 457 487 281 2,605 Pre-derivative position 2,650 161 315 218 3,344 1,195 457 487 281 2,420 Derivative effect 705 181 298 218 8 1,261 561 496 281 77 Net debt position 3,355 20 17 - 3,352 2,456 104 9 - 2,343 Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk There are no significant interest-bearing assets maintained on an ongoing basis.
The income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose National Grid Gas to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose National Grid Gas to fair value interest rate risk.
The interest rate risk management policy, as further explained on page 24, is to minimise the finance costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt.
Some of National Grid Gass borrowings issued are index-linked, that is their cost is linked to changes in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI.
Management believes that these borrowings provide a good hedge for revenues and regulatory asset values that are also RPI-linked.

ii Represents financial instruments which are not directly affected by interest rate risk, including investments in equity or other non-interest bearing instruments.
72 National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory Accounting Statements 2006 07 18.
Financial risk factors continued b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a portfolio basis for the National Grid group as a whole.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
National Grid Gass limits are managed by National Grid plc, as explained in Treasury policies on page 24.
As at 31 March 2007 and 2006, National Grid Gas had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
It is not expected that there will be any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under allocated derivative financial contracts as shown in note 17 was 57m 2006: 150m : after netting agreements it was 41m 2006: 102m.
This exposure is further reduced by collateral received as shown in note 22.
Wholesale and retail credit risk The DNs principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These lay down the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value for each credit rating.
The Metering businesss principal commercial exposure is governed by long-term contracts with gas suppliers which require monthly payment.
Sales to retail customers, such as those requiring connections, are usually settled in cash or using major credit cards.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 20. c Liquidity analysis National Grid Gas manages its liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom position which is used to demonstrate funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date: At 31 March 2007 At 31 March 2006 Due Due Due Due Due Due Due between between 3 years Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total 1 year years years beyond Total m m m m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 1,171 302 324 2,147 3,944 644 199 340 1,726 2,909 Interest payments on borrowings i 107 88 71 1,373 1,639 114 98 78 629 919 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 477 5 - - 482 426 32 - - 458 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts receipts 32 22 6 73 133 55 31 26 183 295 Derivative contracts payments 34 18 8 102 162 34 30 7 45 116 1,757 391 397 3,549 6,094 1,163 328 399 2,217 4,107 i The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking into account future issues.

National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory Accounting Statements 2006 07 73 18.
Financial risk factors continued d Sensitivity analysis at 31 March 2007 Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK Retail Prices Index.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full twelve-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: and sensitivity to the Retail Prices Index does not take into account any changes to revenue or operating costs that are affected by the Retail Prices Index or inflation generally.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK Retail Prices Index and UK interest rates, before the effects of tax.

The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the financial years 2008 to 2055 with some 33% of the spend projected to be spent over the next five years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
National Grid Gas has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2007 relating to gas site decontamination was 70m 2006: 72m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2007, 7m of the total restructuring provision 2006: 10m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, largely to be paid within the next financial year.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2007 include 17m 2006: nil in respect of employer liability claims.
The employer liability claims are based on prior claims experience and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.
