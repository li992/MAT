The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows.
B Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
C Depreciation of property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as set out above.
The selection of these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement.
D Post retirement benefits The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes depends on the selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, mortality and expected return on scheme assets.
Differences arising from actual experiences or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods.

Given that both food and general merchandise are sold from the same locations it is not practical to provide segmental information on operating assets and capital expenditure at this level.
2 2 The assets and liabilities in the comparative period relate to Kings Super Markets.
3 3 Non-operating assets and liabilities include balances in respect of financing and taxation.
Revenue originates in the following geographical segments: United Kingdom 8,218.6m last year 7,473.5m and International 369.5m last year 324.2m.
The value of goods exported from the UK, including shipments to international subsidiaries, amounted to 438.0m last year 367.6m.
Included within UK Retail is an operating profit of 19.5m last year 9.6m in respect of fees received from HSBC in relation to M&S Money.
Accordingly, 7.4m of revenue has been reclassified from foods to general merchandise.
Within general merchandise 20.8m of revenue has been reclassified between clothing and home.

The adjusted earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings excluding the effect of property disposals and exceptional items.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

One of the most significant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the Scheme for the period to March 2006 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent year.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the PMA92 and PFA92 tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2 20 00 07 7 2006 Y Ye ea ar rs s Years Current pensioners at age 65 males 2 21 1.. 0 0 18.8 Current pensioners at age 65 females 2 23 3.. 5 5 22.6 Future pensioners at age 65 males 2 21 1.. 9 9 19.8 Future pensioners at age 65 females 2 24 4.. 3 3 23.6 D D A An na ally ys siis s o of f a as ss se et ts s a an nd d e ex xp pe ec ct te ed d r ra at te es s o of f r re et tu ur rn n The major categories of assets as a percentage of total plan assets are: 2 20 00 07 7 2006 % % % Property partnership interest 9 9 UK equities 1 16 6 17 Overseas equities 2 27 7 30 Government bonds 7 7 16 Corporate bonds Triple B or above 4 41 1 27 Cash and other 10 1 10 00 0 100 The expected long-term rates of return are: 2 20 00 07 7 2006 % % % Property partnership interest 5 5.. 5 5 UK equities 8 8.. 4 4 8.0 Overseas equities 8 8.. 4 4 8.0 Government bonds 4 4.. 7 7 4.3 Corporate bonds Triple B or above 5 5.. 3 3 4.9 Cash and other 4.5 O Ov five er ra allll e ex xp pe ec ct te ed d r re et tu ur rn n 6 6.. 6 6 6.2 The overall expected return on assets assumption is derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.

Inland Revenue rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
The fair values of the options granted during the year have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below: 2 20 00 07 7 2006 3 3 y ye ea ar r p plla an n 5 5 y ye ea ar r p plla an n 3 year plan 5 year plan Grant date N No ov v 0 06 6 N No ov v 0 06 6 Nov 05 Nov 05 Share price at grant date 6 69 98 8p p 6 69 98 8p p 436p 436p Exercise price 5 55 59 9p p 5 55 59 9p p 349p 349p Option life in years 3 3 y ye ea ar rs s 5 5 y ye ea ar rs s 3 years 5 years Risk free rate 5 5.. 4 4% % 5 5.. 3 3% % 4.3% 4.2% Expected volatility 2 21 1.. 5 5% % 2 27 7.. 5 5% % 25.8% 29.8% Expected dividend yield 2 2.. 2 2% % 2 2.. 2 2% % 2.7% 2.7% Fair value of option 2 20 00 0.. 6 6p p 2 24 47 7.. 8 8p p 120.6p 143.6p Volatility has been estimated by taking the historic volatility in the Companys share price over a three or five-year period.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years on the assumption that 15% of three-year options and 20% of five-year options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Company.
No further options may be granted under any schemes other than the 2005 scheme.
No awards have been made under the 2005 scheme.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 46.
Performance targets are assessed over a three-year period from the date of grant with no ability to re-test any grants.
Once options have vested they can be exercised during the period up to ten years from grant date.

Under the Plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on earnings per share growth over three years.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 45.
Awards under this scheme have been made in 2004 05 and 2005 06.
During the year, 3,511,040 shares last year 3,694,559 were awarded under the Plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 572.9p last year 365.7p.
D D D fide ef fe er rr re ed d S Sh ha ar re e B Bo on nu us s P Plla an n The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005 06 as part of the annual bonus scheme for approximately 450 of the most senior managers.
As part of the bonus scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three years.
There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment, and the value of any dividends earned during the deferred period will be paid at the end of the period.
During the year, 1,923,413 shares were awarded under the Plan in relation to the 2005 06 annual bonus.
The fair value of the shares awarded was 550.0p.
E E R Re es st tr riic ct te ed d S Sh ha ar re e P Plla an n A Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention of senior employees who are vital to the success of the business recovery and growth.
The Plan operates for senior executives below Executive Director level.
Awards under the Plan are made as part of ongoing reviews of reward packages, and recruitment tools for new employees.
The shares are held in trust for a period of between one and three years, at which point they are released to the employee, subject to them still being in employment.
During the year, 38,622 shares last year 564,336 have been awarded under the Restricted Share Plan.

The Plan currently operates for one member of senior management, and it is intended that no further awards are made under this Plan.
Participants were required to invest one-third of any annual bonus earned in shares of the Company.
The pre-tax value of the invested bonus would be matched by an award of shares, with the extent of the match determined by the Total Shareholder Return performance measure.
No awards have been made during the year last year nil.

The scheme was not open to those employees who participated in the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The Plan allows employees to invest a proportion of their bonus in shares of the Company.
These investment shares must be held by the participant for three years, during which time they will receive dividends.
At the end of the three-year holding period, if the participant is still in employment with the Company, and still holds the investment shares, they will receive one matching share for every four that they bought.
During the year, 41,086 matching shares have been awarded under the Share Matching Deal Plan, at a fair value of 596.4p.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and changes in income and costs.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a three-year period, which takes account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
Cash flows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.0%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for retail businesses in the UK.
Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to retail businesses.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9.5% has been used.

The average lease term for equipment is five years and 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
22 PARTNERSHIP LIABILITY TO THE MARKS & SPENCER UK PENSION SCHEME The partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme of 496.9m last year nil relates to the amortising liability in respect of the obligations of the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
The Group has agreed a plan with the Pension Scheme Trustee to address the majority of the deficit by transferring properties with a current market value of 1.1bn into a partnership established by the Group.
A limited interest in this partnership was contributed to the Pension Scheme on 13 March 2007.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
The properties held in the partnership have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc.
The pension scheme is entitled to a distribution from the profits of the partnership of 50m per annum for 15 years from July 2008.
The Group has the right to buy out the Trustees partnership interest at any point for an amount equal to the net present value of the remaining annual distributions due to the pension scheme.
Each year the obligation will reduce as payments are made to the pension scheme by the partnership and an interest charge will be taken to the income statement representing the unwinding of the discounted obligation at an implied interest rate of 5.32%.
The fair value of this liability was 495.3m last year nil.
23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury Policy and Financial Risk Management The Group operates a centralised Group Treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Group Treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: 8 82 2 w ww ww w.. m ma ar rk ks sa an nd ds sp pe en nc ce er r.. c co om m a an nn nu ua allr re ep po or rt t2 20 00 07 7 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC Notes to the financial statements continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued a Liquidity funding risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term notes, securitised loan notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a Euro Medium Term Note programme of 3bn, of which 1.2bn last year 1.7bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
Shortterm borrowings are backed by a 1.2bn five-year committed syndicated bank facility, of which 296.9m last year nil was drawn down at the balance sheet date.
b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the sterling, euro and Hong Kong dollar variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date fixed rate borrowings amounted to 1,374.5m last year 1,137.7m representing three public bond issues and finance leases.
Based on the financial liabilities and assets as at the balance sheet date a one percentage point movement in average interest rates will have a 3.0m last year 6.2m impact on the Groups net interest charge.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group Treasury hedge these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 456m last year 270m with a weighted average maturity date of six months last year six months.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
However, the translation exposures arising on the overseas net assets are hedged with foreign currency debt.
As at the balance sheet date, 234m last year nil and HK$113m last year HK$nil currency debt was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 128m last year 109m.
d Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suffer financial loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions.
Exposures are managed through Group Treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure credit ratings.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 68m last year 42m, other receivables 53m last year 33m, cash and cash equivalents 180m last year 363m and derivatives 2m last year 76m.
The Group does not have any material exposures to concentrations of credit risk with any one counterparty.

The attributes of these derivatives matched the characteristics of the underlying debt hedged.
Derivatives moving floating debt to fixed were designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives moving fixed debt to floating were designated as fair value hedges.

To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables then associated fair value movements previously recognised in equity are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 March 2007 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 14 months from the balance sheet date.
With the exception of the Groups fixed rate bond debt and the partnership liability see note 22, there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups fixed rate bond debt was 1,177.3m last year 915.0m, the fair value of this debt was 1,162.9m last year 940.8m.

The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities after the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 Income Taxes during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
2 Following a change in external interpretation of IAS 12 Income Taxes the opening balance sheet at 3 April 2005 has been restated to recognise 48.4m of additional deferred tax assets arising on fixed asset temporary differences.
At 1 April 2006 this balance was previously reported as 143.4m and has been restated to 95.0m.
In arriving at the deferred tax on fixed assets, credit has been taken for capital losses with a tax value of 57.0m last year 56.1m.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries amount to 226.7m last year 187.0m.
The Group is claiming UK tax relief for losses incurred by some of its current and former European subsidiaries.
In the light of continuing litigation, no asset has been recognised in respect of these claims.
The aggregate consideration received was 44.9m last year 61.8m.
