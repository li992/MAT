20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 36 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc the group for the year ended 30 June 2007 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 6 September 2007 and the balance sheet was signed on the boards behalf by Sir Patrick Brown and Nicholas Swift.
The Go-Ahead Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU as they apply to the consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2007, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The group is required to comply with international accounting requirements under IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements except in extremely rare circumstances where management concludes that compliance would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective to present fairly its financial statements.
On that basis, the group has departed from the requirements of IAS19, Employee Benefits and has accounted for its constructive but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension Scheme RPS under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements.
Details of the background and rationale for this departure are provided in note 26.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation A summary of the groups accounting policies applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007 are set out below.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except when otherwise indicated.
As noted above, the group has taken the decision to depart from the requirements of IAS19 Employee Benefits so as to present fairly its financial performance, position, and cash flows in respect of its obligation for the RPS.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results ultimately may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are in relation to: the measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets requires estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate and growth rate, as detailed in note 13: the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires the estimation of future changes in salaries, inflation, the expected return on assets and a selection of a suitable discount rate, as set out in note 26: and the measurement of uninsured liabilities is based on an assessment of the expected settlement of known claims and estimate of the cost of claims not yet reported to the group, as detailed below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2007.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries for use in the consolidation are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent group and are based on consistent accounting policies.
All intergroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Minority interests represent the interests not held by the group in Govia Limited, a 65% owned subsidiary, and are presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the income will flow to the group and the value can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Rendering of services The revenue of the group comprises income from road passenger transport, rail passenger transport and aviation services including parking revenues.
Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport authorities.
Aviation revenue represents funds receivable generated from contracts in place with airlines and other aviation businesses.
It also includes parking revenue generated through the operation and management of car parks and associated services, which include security and bus transportation.
Where the group acts as a managing agent at a car park it recognises only the commission earned as revenue.
Rail revenue comprises amounts based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry, in respect of passenger receipts and other related services such as rolling stock maintenance and commission on tickets sold.
In addition, franchise subsidy receipts from the DfT and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs are treated as revenue, and franchise premium payments to DfT are recognised in operating costs.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers journey or for other services based on the proportion of services provided.
The attributable share of season ticket or travel card income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travel card.
Rental income Rental income is generated from rental of surplus properties and subleasing of rolling stock and railway infrastructure access.
It is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Finance revenue Interest on deposits is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
36 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 37 Government grants Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to a non-current asset, value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to the income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.
Uninsured liabilities The group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties.
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits.
An accrual is made within current liabilities for the estimated cost to the group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
On the basis that the group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are classified as current.
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the group.
Franchise bid costs A key part of the groups activities is the process of bidding for and securing franchises to operate rail services in the UK.
All franchise bid costs incurred prior to achieving preferred bidder status are treated as an expense in the income statement irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the bid.
Directly attributable, third party incremental costs incurred after achieving preferred bidder status are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over the life of the franchise.
Profit revenue sharing agreements The rail companies have certain revenue and profit sharing agreements with the DfT.
An accrual is made within amounts payable to central government for the estimated cost to the group of the relevant amounts payable.
Exceptional items The group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of revenue or expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow better understanding of financial performance.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Land and buildings are recognised initially at cost and thereafter measured at fair value less depreciation on buildings and impairment subsequent to the date of valuation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Valuations of land and buildings are performed by either the directors or by a qualified valuer, frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted on a prospective basis if appropriate at each financial year end.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease terms.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on cost or fair value, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings over 10 to 100 years Rolling stock over 8 to 15 years Plant and equipment over 3 to 15 years The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve except where it reverses a decrease in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the income statement.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement except to the extent of any existing surplus in respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.
An annual transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to revenue reserves for the depreciation relating to the revaluation surplus.
Upon disposal any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions of businesses since 3 July 2004 are accounted for under IFRS3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the costs of the business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS3 at the acquisition date.
It is capitalised and carried as an asset on the balance sheet.
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill, this is released immediately to the income statement.
In some instances certain fair value accounting adjustments are required to be made using provisional estimates, based on information available, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the 12 months following the acquisition, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
37 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 38 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill continued Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous amounts, and has been subject to impairment testing as at the transition date and annually thereafter.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 27 June 1998 has not been reinstated.
In the event of subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates, goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal to be charged to the income statement.
Impairment of assets The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount, being the higher of the assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The reinstated amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal, on assets carried at a valuation, is treated as a valuation increase.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Franchise assets Where the conditions relating to the award of a franchise require the group to assume legal responsibility for any pension liability that exists at that point in time, the group recognises a liability representing the fair value of the related net pension deficit that the group expects to fund during the franchise term.
When a pension deficit exists at the start of the franchise, a corresponding intangible asset is recognised, reflecting a cost in acquiring the right to operate the franchise.
If a pension surplus exists at the start of the franchise then a corresponding deferred income balance is recognised, representing a government grant.
The intangible asset or deferred income balance is amortised through the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the franchise.
The carrying value of franchise assets is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the award of the franchise and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Software Software, that is not integral to the related hardware, is stated at cost less amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement evenly over its expected useful life of 3 to 5 years.
Inventories Stocks of fuel and engineering spares are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and costs incurred in bringing the items to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs of sale.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets and derivatives Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with IAS39.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The group uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with fuel price fluctuations.
Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the cash flow hedge results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a liability, then at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-financial asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the period which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of the related non-financial asset as described above.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
38 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 39 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortisation of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or other fide-recognition of debt, are recognised directly in the income statement.
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet, with a corresponding liability being recognised, and are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Treasury shares Re-acquired shares in the group, which remain uncancelled, are deducted from equity.
Consideration paid and the associated costs are also recognised in shareholders funds as a separate reserve for own shares.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the groups shares is transferred from the reserve for own shares to revenue reserves.
Retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension schemes: both defined benefit and defined contribution.
The costs of these, as described below, are recognised in the income statement within operating costs.
As discussed below, the group has invoked the provisions of IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements and has departed from the requirements of IAS19 in respect of the rail pension schemes.
Non-rail schemes The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of obligations during the period, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
The group has applied the option under IAS19 to recognise actuarial gains and losses in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the period in which they occur.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost, along with the current service cost, is recognised in the income statement within operating costs.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Contributions payable under defined contribution schemes are charged to operating costs in the income statement as they fall due.
Rail schemes Our train operating companies participate in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a defined benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK Rail Industry.
This is partitioned into sections and the group is responsible for the funding of these schemes whilst it operates the relevant franchise.
In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
A liability or asset is recognised in line with other defined benefit schemes in the group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability or asset represents the deficit or surplus that the group expects to fund or benefit from during the franchise term.
This represents a departure from IAS19 so as to present fairly the groups financial performance, position and cash flow in respect of its obligations for the RPS.
Share-based payment transactions The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS2 and has applied IFRS2 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, determined by an external valuation using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled options, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc market conditions.
The cost of options is recognised in the income statement over the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised, at each reporting date, reflects the extent to which the period to vesting has expired and the directors best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
39 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 40 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities for taxation purposes, and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
It is provided for on all temporary differences, except: on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Otherwise, tax is recognised in the income statement.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 Amendment to IAS1: Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 Amendment to IAS23 Borrowing costs 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC Effective date IFRIC10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on Defined Benefit Assets, Minimum Funding Requirements 1 January 2008 The directors are currently reviewing the requirements of IFRIC 8, 12 and the amendment to IAS23 to determine whether there will be a material impact on the groups financial statements.
Upon adoption of IFRS7 the group needs to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposures in greater detail.
Apart from this the directors do not anticipate the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.

The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets, as detailed in the divisional review in Go-Ahead at a glance on page 4.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The group has only one reportable geographical segment, being the United Kingdom.
Business segments The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding the groups business segments for the years ended 30 June 2007 and 1 July 2006.

Sharesave Scheme The group operates a HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved savings-related share option scheme, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003 the Sharesave Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme is open to all group employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months service with a group company at the date they are invited to participate in the scheme.
Qualifying employees are invited to save between 5 and 75 per month up to a maximum of 250 per month across all schemes for a period of three years.
At the end of that period, employees can apply the amounts saved, together with a bonus, in acquiring shares in the company at a minimum price equal to 80% of their market price at the time of invitation.
There are savings-related options at 30 June 2007 as follows: Scheme maturity 1 June 2010 1 July 2009 1 June 2008 1 Jan 2006 Option price 19.14 14.62 12.10 4.84 No.

The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The key assumptions input into the model used for the options granted in the year to 30 June 2007 were: 2007 2006 % per annum % per annum Future share price volatility 20.0 20.0 Future dividend yield 2.5 2.5 Future risk-free interest rate 5.4 5.4 Forfeiture rate 10.0 10.0 Option life 3 years 3 years The future share price volatility assumption is based on the daily share price movements over the three year period preceding the award date, rounded to the nearest 5%.
Share Incentive Plan The company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP.
The SIP is open to all group employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months service with a group company at the date they are invited to participate in the plan.
The SIP permits the company to make four different types of awards to employees free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and dividend shares, although the company has, so far, made awards of partnership shares only.
Under these awards, the company invites qualifying employees to apply between 10 and 125 per month in acquiring shares in the company at the prevailing market price.
Under the terms of the scheme, certain tax advantages are available to the company and employees.

The LTIP provides for executive directors and certain other senior employees to be awarded shares in the company conditional on specified performance conditions being met over a period of three years.
Refer to the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 21 to 26 for further details of the LTIP.
The expense recognised for the LTIP during the year to 30 June 2007 was 0.4m 2006 0.1m.
The fair value of LTIP options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

During the year our TOCs have negotiated a new basis for determining the cost of electricity going forward.
In return for agreeing to revise the terms of the related track access agreements to reflect this new basis, Network Rail required the group to make a one-off compensation payment during the year.
This cost has been identified as an exceptional item, given the size of this payment and the fact that it was made to secure a fundamental change to the basis on which the group is charged for EC4T.
The redundancy and re-organisation costs in 2006 were as a result of significant re-organisations in the aviation division and the South Coast bus operations, plus actual and planned redundancies following the handover of the Southeastern rail franchise.
Property relocation costs were costs incurred during the major depot restructuring programme at Metrobus in 2006.
The profit on sale of properties related to disposals of various bus depots in 2006.

The brought forward element of the franchise intangible is made up of 17.8m relating to the opening deficit in the RPS pension schemes and 17.9m relating to the best estimate of the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise assets relating to the Southeastern rail franchise.
The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the franchises being seven years and eight years respectively.
The franchise intangible for the Southeastern franchise was initially recognised at 17.9m and has a carrying value of 14.1m as at 30 June 2007.
During the year, the final cost of the Southeastern acquired intangible asset has been ascertained and agreed with the DfT and the adjustment in the year reflects this.
Software costs Software costs capitalised exclude software that is not integral to the related hardware.
There are no internally generated costs that have been capitalised.
Customer contracts The addition relates to the value attributed to customer contracts and relationships purchased as part of the groups acquisitions during the year.
The value is calculated based on the unexpired term of the contracts at the date of acquisition and is amortised over that period.
Goodwill As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is annually tested for impairment.
The goodwill charge of 2.4m 2006 2.4m is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to be impaired annually.
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the groups business operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by cash generating unit is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Plane Handling 16.1 16.1 Meteor Parking 19.7 15.1 New Southern Railway 5.8 8.2 Metrobus 6.5 6.5 Go South Coast 28.6 27.0 Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1 Go West Midlands 3.8 4.1 London Bus 9.6 92.2 79.1 49 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 50 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three year period.
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts, using the following growth rates which reflect the directors view of long term growth rates in each business: 2007 2006 % % Plane Handling 2.25 2.25 Meteor Parking New Southern Railway 3.00 3.00 Bus companies 3.00 3.00 The cash flows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a discount rate of 10.6% 2006 10.7%, based on the groups weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash generating unit of 0-2% 2006 0-2%.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cash flows, the discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
The operating cash flows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff costs and general overheads.
These assumptions are influenced by several factors both internally and externally.
The directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts and have therefore not presented any sensitivity analysis.

21 Provisions Depots m At 1 July 2006 8.0 Utilised 6.7 At 30 June 2007 1.3 A significant redevelopment of the depot facilities at one of the groups rail subsidiaries is virtually complete.
Whilst the majority of the project has been funded by the DfT, there was a risk that the group would need to fund part of the final total cost of the project.
On that basis a provision existed as at 1 July 2006 to cover the element that the group anticipated it would be required to fund.
The majority of this has been settled in the year and the remaining element of the provision is expected to be settled in the next two years.

The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 3.8m 2006 3.2m being the contributions paid and payable.
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The Go-Ahead Plan is a group plan for related companies where risks are shared.
The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in the groups financial statements according to IAS19.
Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that company.
The Go-Ahead Group plc accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid.

This is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The plan is open to new entrants.
Southern Vectis Group Pension Scheme Employees of the Southern Vectis group of companies participate in the Southern Vectis Group Pension Scheme.
Other pension arrangements Employees of Meteor Parking and aviance have access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements.
The expense recognised for this is 0.4m 2006 0.2m, being the contributions paid.
The Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees of New Southern Railway Limited and London and South Eastern Railway Limited are members of sections of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
In addition to the defined benefit cost, brass matching AVC company contributions of 0.7m 2006 0.4m were paid in the year.
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS scheme rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.
IAS19 would require the group to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation under the terms of each franchise agreement.
Following industry practice, the group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations.
In all other respects the groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes.
In doing so, the group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS1 and departed from the requirements of IAS19 Employee Benefits in order to achieve a fair presentation of the groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment, which is that portion of the deficit surplus projected to exist at the end of the franchise which the group will not be required to fund benefit from.
If the group had accounted for the rail schemes in accordance with the full provisions of IAS19 the following adjustments would have been made to the financial statements: 2007 2006 m m Balance sheet Defined benefit pension plan 6.0 23.4 Deferred tax asset 2.9 11.4 Deferred income government grant 9.2 13.2 Intangible asset 1.1 1.5 13.4 26.7 Statement of recognised income and expense Actuarial losses 15.2 6.2 Tax on actuarial losses 4.3 1.9 10.9 4.3 Income statement Operating costs franchise adjustment 1.3 1.5 Intangible asset amortisation 0.3 0.4 Release of deferred income government grant 4.1 4.1 Curtailment gain 2.5 Deferred tax charge 0.9 1.5 2.2 3.2 IAS19 disclosures All of the above plans have been accounted for under IAS19 covering employee benefits.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the groups activities, namely working capital, fixed assets expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buy backs.
The group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
Interest rate risk The main risk arising from the groups financial instruments is changes in interest rates.
The boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to six months.
Excluding fixed rate debt, the group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.
Details of interest rates are shown in note 28.
Liquidity risk The group has bilateral arrangements, totalling 200m at 30 June 2007 2006 145m with prevailing interest rates and dates of maturity as detailed in note 20.
The majority of the groups road passenger vehicles are financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
Operating leases The group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This results in 0.4m 2006 0.9m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 10.1m 2006 21.1m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent guarantees.

The group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.
As at 30 June 2007 the group had derivatives in place for 60,000,000 litres of fuel, representing approximately half of the current years anticipated fuel usage in our bus businesses.
Foreign currency risk The group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material.
Should larger foreign currency transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign exchange risk.
Credit risk The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cash flows.
The majority of the groups receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies such as the DfT.
The group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this, the group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
Managing capital The group aims to optimize its capital structure by holding an appropriate level of debt relative to equity.
The appropriate level of debt is set with reference to a number of factors and financial ratios.
These include expected operating and capital expenditure cash flows, dividend policy, contingent liabilities and restricted rail cash, and the level and likelihood of potential acquisition and disposal opportunities.
The group uses an on-market share buy back programme as the principal means of increasing the level of debt relative to equity.
28 Derivatives and financial instruments a Fair values The fair values of the groups financial instruments carried in the financial statements have been reviewed as at 30 June 2007 and are as follows: 2007 2006 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 0.7 0.7 Fixed rate debt 43.1 40.7 22.4 22.0 42.4 40.0 22.4 22.0 The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 18,19 and 20 is not significantly different to their carrying amount.
The fuel price derivatives were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing rates.
b Hedging activities At the year end, the group had various fuel price swaps in place.
Cash flow hedges were placed over 60m litres of fuel for the year ended 28 June 2008, and 17m litres of fuel for the period 1 July 2010 to 31 October 2012.
The fair value of the asset has been recognised on the balance sheet.
The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices.
The gains and losses on instruments used for hedging fuel price risk are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
There are no net unrecognised gains losses as at 30 June 2007.
