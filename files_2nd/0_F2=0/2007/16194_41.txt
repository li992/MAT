The carrying amount of the Groups oil and gas assets includes an amount of 8,147,000 2006: 10,381,000 in respect of assets held under finance leases.
Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
