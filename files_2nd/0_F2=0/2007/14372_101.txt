SHARE CAPITAL The principal trading market for the Ordinary Shares is the London Stock Exchange.
The Ordinary Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
On 15 December 2003 a ratio change was effected whereby the number of ordinary shares represented by each ADS changed from ten to five.
All prices of ADSs prior to this date have been restated to reflect this ratio change.
TheADR facilityis sponsored by TheBankof NewYorkactingas depositary.
All the Ordinary Shares, including those held by directors and officers, rank pari passu with each other.
Following approval by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting in December 2005, on 23 January 2006, the 2 Ordinary Shares of 12 9 pence were redenominated as Ordinary Shares of US 20.
The new US Dollar Ordinary Shares carry the same rights as the previous Ordinary Shares.
The shares continue to be traded on the London Stock Exchange and quoted in Sterling.
The ADSs continue to represent five Ordinary Shares.
In order to comply with English law the Company has issued 50,000 of shares in Sterling.
These were issued as Deferred Shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value.
These were allotted to the Chief Executive, though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another memberofthe Boardshouldit so wish.
Shareholdings As at 12 March 2008, 8,861,618 ADSs equivalent to 44,308,090 Ordinary Shares or approximately 4.98% of the total OrdinaryShares inissue, were outstandingand were held by 62 registered holders.
As at 12 March 2008, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 23,310 registered holders of Ordinary Shares, of whom 92 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 215,639 Ordinary Shares less than 1% of the total issued.
Because certain Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of OrdinaryShares resident inthe US.
