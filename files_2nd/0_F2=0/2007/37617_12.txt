Staff costs and employees continued c Pension benefits The Group operates various pension schemes throughout the world, including a number of funded defined benefit and contribution schemes.
Where appropriate, the fund assets, liabilities and pension costs for the year are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit schemes.
i Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2007 2006 $m $m Continuing operations 9 7 Defined contribution pension costs for discontinued operations totalled $17 million 2006: $10 million giving a total for the Group of $26 million 2006: $17 million ii Defined benefit schemes The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuations as at 31 March 2007 were: UK scheme US scheme Swiss scheme 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 5.4 5.0 5.75 3.0 3.0 Price inflation 3.2 3.0 1.5 1.5 Expected return on plan assets 6.9 6.7 8.0 3.0 3.0 Future salary increases 5.8 5.6 5.0 5.0 5.0 Pension in payment increases 3.5 3.25 Deferred pensions increases 5.0 5.0 The US scheme was terminated during the year.
Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
The latest actuarial valuation of the largest scheme, the Man Group plc Pension Fund formerly known as the ED & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, a UK defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 2005, using the Projected Unit Cost method.
This is a closed scheme and the current service cost is expected to increase as the members approach retirement.
For the UK scheme, the Group has agreed to contribute 34.2% of pensionable salaries each year until 2008.
The Group made an additional $19 million contribution in August 2006.
The following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions applied and sensitivities in the valuation of the Groups largest scheme, the UK scheme.
The discount rate is based on yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration.
The annualised yield on the index constructed by iBoxx of AA rated stocks of duration of 15 years or more was 5.4% at 31 March 2007 4.94% at 31 March 2006.
The mean term of the 15-year index falls short of the mean term of the liabilities of the Fund of around 20 years, but in the absence of suitable data, the iBoxx yields are thought to be an appropriate guide.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Investment market conditions suggest an expected return on equities of around 8.0%, expected bond returns of around 5.2%, and expected return on other plan assets hedge funds, cash of around 7.6%.
The pension increase entitlement for the majority of members in the Fund is RPI subject to a minimum of 3.0% per annum and a maximum of 5.0% per annum.
Pension increases have been assumed to be at a rate of 3.5% per annum reflecting the possibility that future increases are likely to be higher than price inflation.
99 Man Group plc Annual Report 2007 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 5.
Staff costs and employees continued In light of recent experience, which suggests that there has been lower mortality than previously assumed, it is thought appropriate to update the mortality tables to allow for the general improvements being experienced.
As a result, the table of mortality rates PA92C05 with no age rating is now being used.
In addition, allowance is made for future improvements in mortality rates by reducing the discount rate by 0.25% per annum, which increases the balance sheet liabilities.
In practical terms, the table below sets out the expectations of life for male and female members currently aged 60 and for those who will be 60 years old in 20 years time.
Current life expectancy Life expectancy in 20 years time years years Male aged 60 24.4 25.8 Female aged 60 27.5 28.8 The figures presented below make no allowance for the withdrawal of Brokerage employees as a result of the planned IPO.
The current expectation is that this will take place with effect from 1 July 2007.
The trustees of the Fund have not yet agreed the terms on which any transfer to the new scheme to be established by Brokerage will be made.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on a profit for the year of $1,285 million 2006: $1,014 million for continuing and discontinued operations, and a profit for the year of $175 million 2006: $54 million for discontinued operations.
The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share for continuing and discontinued operations is based on 1,852,685,662 2006: 1,804,148,292 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after excluding the shares owned by the Man Group plc employee trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The diluted earnings per share is based on a profit for the year of $1,310 million 2006: $1,047 million for continuing and discontinued operations, and a profit for the year of $175 million 2006: $54 million for discontinued operations.

The comparison of fair value to book value for borrowings is shown in Note 22 and for repurchase contracts in Notes 15,17 and 21. c Brokerage uses netting agreements for certain transactions including stock lending, stock borrowing, repurchase, reverse repurchase, and similar transactions.
Such transactions are performed under standard market agreements.
Derivative transactions for clients are transacted under the Groups standard terms of business in each location which provide for netting in the event of default.
Over-the-counter transactions are performed mostly under International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are negotiated bilaterally and provide for a single net settlement in the event of default of either counterparty.
d Brokerage acts as a matched principal broker in stock lending and borrowing, repurchase and reverse repurchase and similar collateralised financing transactions.
These transactions involve the receipt of stock against the payment of cash collateral and or the pledge of non-cash collateral or the pledge of stock against the receipt of cash and or non-cash collateral.
Cash collateral paid under such agreements is shown on the balance sheet in trade receivables Note 18 as secured stock lending and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Cash collateral received under such transactions is recorded in trade payables Note 21 as secured stock borrowing and securities purchased under agreements to resell.
Transactions where stock is pledged against the receipt of non-cash collateral or where stock is received against the pledge of non-cash collateral are not recorded on the balance sheet.
The non-cash collateral pledged in such transactions is recorded in short term investments where the Group has purchased and owns such non-cash collateral.
The non-cash collateral is not recorded on the balance sheet where it has been borrowed and subsequently re-pledged.
Substantially all of the non-cash collateral received under such agreements is passed back to counterparties as collateral for other stock lending type transactions.
Substantially all of the investments in equities and bonds, recorded in short term investments Note 20 are passed as collateral to counterparties involved in such transactions.
At 31 March 2007, the division had paid net margin of $917 million $2006: $727 million to its counterparties and received net margin of $490 million 2006: $435 million from its counterparties.

Intangible assets continued a Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units equivalent to each of the Groups acquisitions categorised by business segment.
The carrying amounts are presented below: 2007 2006 $m $m Asset Management: Glenwood 76 76 RMF 621 621 Man Investments Australia 88 76 773 Brokerage: GNI 52 Fox 7 Union Cal 1 FADC 1 61 785 834 To determine whether impairment exists, the carrying value of goodwill is compared with the assets recoverable amount on an annual basis at the balance sheet date.
All of the recoverable amounts were calculated based on value in use.
To calculate the value in use, an estimate of future cash flows from each acquisition and expectations about possible variations in the amount of these cash flows have been considered, including where acquired businesses have been integrated into existing businesses.
An appropriate risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate is applied to these future cash flows, resulting in a balance representing their value in use, which is compared with the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether impairment exists.
The key assumptions used by management for value in use calculations for each acquisition, by business segment, include: Rates p. a Asset Management: Net management fee growth 5% Net performance fee growth 0% Discount rate 10% Brokerage: Growth rate 0% Discount rate 10% Discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect estimates that the market would expect of an investment with an equivalent risk profile.
A range of growth rates is used to simulate expected best and worst case scenarios, taking into consideration past performance and expectations for market development.
The growth rates used in the discounted cash flow models are conservative in that they are lower than managements expectations and those included in the budgets for future years.
In Asset Management, even if the growth rates applied to net management fee income were reduced to zero, net performance fee income excluded altogether and the discount rate increased to 15%, there would still be no impairment to goodwill.
As a result of these calculations, no impairment was identified.
b Intangible assets with finite useful lives Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
In addition these are reviewed for impairment if there are any indications of impairment.
No indications of impairment were evidenced during the year.

The investment in BlueCrest includes goodwill of $198 million 2006: $174 million.
The increase in the year relates to currency movements.
This is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the assets recoverable amount on an annual basis at the balance sheet date.
A value in use basis is used to calculate the recoverable amount by estimating the future cash flows for net management fee income and net performance fee income and discounting them at an appropriate risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The discount rate applied is 10% and net management fee income is assumed to grow at 5% per annum and net performance fee income is assumed to remain constant no growth.

As stated in the Principal Accounting Policies there are some instances where the Group has investments in certain fund entities over which it is able to exert significant influence but not control.
These are classified as associates.
The Group has applied the scope exclusion within IAS 28 Investments in Associates for mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities and has classified such holdings as short-term investments and measured them at fair value through the income statement in accordance with IAS 39.
In accordance with IAS 28, summarised financial information relating to these investments is included in the table below together with associates where equity accounting is applied.
The investments in these fund entities are either liquidity investments, to aid investors wishing to buy and sell investments in the fund entities, or seeding investments.
These investments are not held for the long-term and there are frequent changes in the level of the Groups ownership of investments.
The summarised aggregate financial information of associates is as follows: Weighted Pre-tax average Assets Liabilities Revenues profit loss interest held Year ended 31 March 2007 $m $m$m$m % BlueCrest Capital Management 204 177 482 232 25.00 Fund entities held at fair value through profit or loss 17,810 832 1,077 400 3.66 Other associates where equity accounting is applied 213 90 103 32 22.02 18,227 1,099 1,662 664 Year ended 31 March 2006 BlueCrest Capital Management 105 52 329 210 25.00 Fund entities held at fair value through profit or loss 7,770 1,461 605 453 2.60 Other associates where equity accounting is applied 206 89 64 3 21.86 8,081 1,602 998 660 b Investment in joint ventures The summarised aggregate financial information of joint ventures where an economic interest is held is as follows: 2007 2006 $m $m Balance sheet: Non-current assets 2 Current assets 15 19 Current liabilities 4 2 Non-current liabilities Net assets 11 19 Income statement: Income 16 6 Expenses 8 4 Profit for the year 8 2 117 Man Group plc Annual Report 2007 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 15.

Man Group plc Annual Report 2007 118 Financial Statements 15.
Other non-current investments continued Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such upon initial recognition.
The fair values of private equity investments are determined using the fair values of the underlying investments provided by the General Partner of the Limited Partnership.
The fair values of collateralised debt obligation investments are provided by third party investment banks and are determined using financial models that take into account a number of factors, including general interest rate and market conditions, macroeconomic and deal-specific credit fundamentals, and the use of cash flow projections based on assumptions regarding default and recovery.
The fair values of equity investments in US limited liability partnerships are determined by using the fair values of the underlying investments, which may include private placements and other securities for which values are not readily available, and are determined by the investment advisors of the respective underlying portfolio funds.
Investments in treasury bills and notes are held as collateral against repurchase contracts that are held to maturity.
The investments are held at amortised cost and the fair value of the investments are determined by discounting to present value the future interest and principal cash payments.
In the comparative period the fair value was $1,909 million.

Forester Limited, a special purpose entity details in Note 33, has issued guaranteed exchangeable bonds of 400 million at par value, guaranteed by Man Group plc and which mature in November 2009.
The bonds have the following features: 1 a coupon of 3.75%, paid semi-annually: 2 holders have the option at any time to exchange for Man Group plc ordinary shares at an initial exchange price of 12.82 2.13 post the sub-division of the ordinary shares : 3 Forester Limited can redeem the bonds early at their principal amount together with accrued interest at any time on or after 15 days after the fifth anniversary of the issue of the bonds if on not less than 20 days out of a period of 30 consecutive days the Man Group plc share price exceeds 130% of the then current exchange price or at any time if less than 15% of the total issue remains outstanding: and 4 Forester Limited has the option to redeem either on maturity or early redemption the bonds for a fixed number of shares.
On 5 November 2004, the terms and conditions of the exchangeable bonds were amended to remove the option, which Forester Limited had, to settle in cash rather than shares, upon exercise of an exchange right by a bondholder.
On 20 August 2006, 38% of the Groups exchangeable bonds were converted, following an offer by the Group to pay a fixed cash sum to bondholders.
The cost of the cash incentive offer amounted to $12 million and this has been expensed within the finance expense line of the income statement.
The remaining bonds are expected to convert within one year as a result of the Groups call option, which is exercisable in November 2007 and therefore the balance of exchangeable bonds outstanding is classified as amounts falling due within one year.
The maturity of non-current borrowings at their contractual repricing dates are as follows: 2007 2006 $m $m Amounts falling due: Between one and two years 154 45 Between two and five years 897 1,346 More than five years 49 106 1,100 1,497 The carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups borrowings are as follows: 2007 2006 Fair Carrying Fair Carrying $m $m $m $m Bank loans 249 249 27 27 Private placement notes senior debt 299 296 296 291 Private placement notes subordinated debt 210 203 205 199 Floating rate notes subordinated debt 408 398 405 398 Exchangeable bonds 462 443 663 609 1,628 1,589 1,596 1,524 Man Group plc Annual Report 2007 126 Financial Statements 22.
Borrowings continued The fair value of the exchangeable bonds is determined by reference to their listed price on the London Stock exchange.
The fair values of private placement notes excluding the effect of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps held as hedges are determined by reference to independent third-party issuers of similar debt instruments that have similar credit ratings.
Bank loans, overdrafts and floating rate notes are subject to floating rates of interest and the carrying amounts reflect their fair values.
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates, including and excluding the effect of interest rate swaps, were as follows: 2007 2006 Including Excluding Including Excluding swaps swaps swaps swaps % % % % Bank loans and overdrafts n a 6.3 Private placement notes senior debt 6.2 5.4 5.7 5.3 Private placement notes subordinated debt 7.5 5.9 7.1 5.9 Floating rate notes subordinated debt n a 6.6 n a 6.2 Exchangeable bonds 8.7 7.7 7.7 7.7 The Groups fixed rate borrowings have been swapped to floating rate for the duration of the fixed interest period.
All of the Groups borrowings are thus subject to floating rate charges, exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

In addition, 50,000 unlisted deferred Sterling shares 2006: 50,000 with a par value of 1 per share 2006: 1 per share were issued on 29 July 2004.
These shares are necessary to continue to comply with Section 118 of the Companies Act 1985, following the redenomination of the ordinary share capital into ordinary shares of 18 US cents each on that date.
The deferred Sterling shares have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, no rights to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting and no right to participate in any distribution in a winding up except for a return of the nominal value of the shares after the return on the nominal amount paid up on every other class of share and the distribution of 100,000,000,000 to every other holder of every other class of share.
