b Total provision for restructuring costs is made up of: 2007 2006 US$M US$M Redundancies 3 5 Business terminations including contract cancellations 102 163 105 168 The expenditure associated with total restructuring provisions is expected to be incurred over a period exceeding more than one year.
c Total provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs is made up of: 2007 2006 US$M US$M Operating sites 3,463 2,839 Closed sites 1,466 1,273 4,929 4,112 These restoration, closure and rehabilitation expenditures are expected to be incurred over the mine lives of our operations as restoration, closure and rehabilitation activities are required to be undertaken, with the majority expected to be paid over approximately the next 30 years.
The provisions for restoration, closure and rehabilitation are derived by discounting the expected expenditures to their net present value.
The estimated total site closure and rehabilitation cost undiscounted and in todays dollars to be incurred in the future arising from operations to date, and including amounts already provided, is US$11,521 million 2006: US$6,939 million.
Due to the nature of the closed site liabilities and the degree of uncertainty which surrounds them, the Group believes that it is reasonably possible that these liabilities could be in the order of 25 per cent 2006: 25 per cent greater, or in the order of 20 per cent 2006: 20 per cent lower than the US$1,466 million provided at year end.
The main closed site to which this total amount relates is Southwest Copper in the US and this is described in further detail below, together with a brief description of other closed sites.
Actual expenditure associated with these activities occurs both before and after closure and can continue for an extended period of time dependent on restoration, closure and rehabilitation requirements.
Southwest Copper, Arizona, US The BHP Copper Inc operations comprised several mining and smelting operations and associated facilities, much of which had been operating for many years prior to the BHP Billiton Group acquiring the operation in 1996.
In 1999, the facilities were effectively placed on a care and maintenance basis, pending evaluation of various alternative strategies to realise maximum value from the respective assets.
The BHP Billiton Group announced the closure of the San Manuel mining facilities and the San Manuel plant facilities in 2002 and 2003 respectively.
During the current year, the restart of the Pinto Valley mining operation was approved.
Pinto Valley is an open-cut copper mine in Arizona, USA, and part of Southwest Copper.
As such, the closed site provision relating to Pinto Valley was reclassified as an operating site provision.
A comprehensive review of closure plans conducted at the BHP Copper Inc facilities in 200304 indicated: a higher short-term closure costs due to changes in the nature of closure work required in relation to certain facilities, particularly tailings dams and waste and leach dumps: b a need for costs, such as water management and environmental monitoring, to continue for a longer period: and c an increase in the residual value of certain assets.
The closure provisions for BHP Copper Inc, including amounts in relation to Pinal Creek litigation, total US$603 million at 30 June 2007 2006: US$734 million.
In relation to Pinal Creek, BHP Copper Inc BHP Copper is involved in litigation concerning groundwater contamination resulting from historic mining operations near the Pinal Creek Miami Wash area located in the State of Arizona.
In 1994, Roy Wilkes and Diane Dunn initiated a toxic tort class action lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona.
In September 2000, the Court approved a settlement reached between the parties for a non-material amount.
A State consent decree the Decree was approved by the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona in August 1998.
The Decree authorises and requires groundwater remediation and facility-specific source control activities, and the members of the Pinal Creek Group which consists of BHP Copper, Phelps Dodge Miami Inc and Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co are jointly liable for performing the non-facility specific source control activities.
Such activities are currently ongoing.
As of 30 June 2007, we have provided US$122 million 2006: US$118 million for our anticipated share of the planned remediation work, based on a range reasonably foreseeable up to US$166 million 2006: US$138 million, and we have paid out US$55 million up to 30 June 2007.
These amounts are based on the provisional equal allocation of these costs among the three members of the Pinal Creek Group.
BHP Copper is seeking a judicial restatement of the allocation formula to reduce its share, based upon its belief, supported by relevant external legal and technical advice, that its property has contributed a smaller share of the contamination than the other parties properties.
BHP Copper is contingently liable for the whole of these costs in the event that the other parties are unable to pay.
BHP Copper and the other members of the Pinal Creek Group filed a contribution action in November 1991 in the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona against former owners and operators of the properties alleged to have caused the contamination.
As part of this action, BHP Copper is seeking an equitable allocation of cleanup costs between BHP Copper, the other members of the Pinal Creek Group, and BHP Coppers predecessors.
BHP Coppers predecessors have asserted a counterclaim in this action seeking indemnity from BHP Copper based upon their interpretation of the historical transaction documents relating to the succession in interest of the parties.
BHP Copper has also filed suit against a number of insurance carriers seeking to recover under various insurance policies for remediation, response, source control and other costs noted above incurred by BHP Copper.
Other closed sites The closure provisions for other closed sites total US$863 million at 30 June 2007 2006: US$539 million.
