85 Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Financial statements Group accounts Notes to the accounts continued For the year ended 31 March 13 Intangible fixed assets continued Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill or intangible assets might be impaired.
No impairment of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets was recognised in 2007 2006: nil.
Goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of AME Info FZ-LLC AME, Trades Exhibitions Limited TEL, and Yospace Technologies Ltd Yospace has been allocated to the group of assets or cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
When testing for impairment, recoverable amounts for all of the Groups CGUs are measured at their value in use by discounting the future expected cash flows from the assets in the CGUs.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on management approved budgets and the Groups five year plan and, in the case of businesses acquired in the year, the cash flow projections are consistent with the business acquisition plans.
Cash flows beyond the initial five year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 2.25% 2006: 2.25% which is inflation only.
The cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 12% 2006: 13%, the Groups current cost of capital.
These assumptions have been used for all CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
The most significant amounts of goodwill allocated to separate CGUs are 145m 2006: 147m allocated to the group of assets which generate cash flows from B2B international activities, and 278m 2006: 278m allocated to the group of assets which generate cash flows from radio activities in the UK.
The B2B international activities include WGSN, Cannes Lions and several smaller international assets.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation for the B2B international CGU and UK radio CGU are revenue and profit growth respectively, based on historical performance and expectations about future performance.
No other goodwill balances allocated to other CGUs, in aggregate 90m 2006: 80m, are individually significant to the Groups total goodwill balance.
The radio advertising market and industry are currently subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
Based on current estimates and forecasts the Group expects to be able to mitigate any potential decline in revenues such that the value in use will continue to cover the carrying value of the goodwill and intangibles associated with the radio UK CGU.
Brand value includes 45m 2006: 45m in respect of indefinite life brand values and is therefore not subject to amortisation.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets do not include any internally generated assets.
Businesses acquired during the year relate to intangibles identified as part of the acquisitions of AME, TEL and Yospace.
These intangibles all have a finite life and are being amortised over their useful lives.
No impairment of intangibles was recognised in 2007 2006: 14m.
The 2006 impairment charge related primarily to our healthcare titles, in particular, Nursing Times magazine, which is part of the B2B segment.
The increased amortisation compared to 2006 is as a result of the amortisation of newly acquired intangible assets and an accelerated amortisation period for print-based recruitment titles.
During the year, the Group reviewed the appropriateness of the remaining useful economic lives for its other intangible assets and no changes were deemed necessary.
The useful economic lives for the Groups intangible assets range from five to 20 years.
Other relates to the clear down of cost and accumulated depreciation for assets with a net book value of nil which are no longer used.
