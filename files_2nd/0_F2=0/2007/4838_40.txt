These reviews are carried out using the following criteria.
An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition.
Such acquisitions are determined to be a Cash Generating Unit CGU as determined by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating its value in use.
The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP.
The value in use is compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjp Nordic AS Elkjp, UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro and FotoVista S. A. FotoVista and are as follows: Key assumptions for 2007 Growth Pre tax rate beyond risk adjusted 2007 2006 five years discount rate million million Elkjp 2.2% 11.1% 516.3 528.5 UniEuro 1.4% 12.9% 325.9 431.4 FotoVista 1.8% 13.3% 141.9 The growth rate beyond five years applied to Elkjp and FotoVista is based on a single published GDP.
The growth rate beyond five years applied for UniEuro is based on the mid point in a range of growth rates in GDP provided by third parties.
The directors believe that this rate provides an appropriate reflection of the growth rate in the product markets in which UniEuro operates.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital with a risk premium reflecting the relative risks in the markets in which the businesses operate.
For UniEuro, a sustained period of weakness in the Italian economy highlighted by poor trading in the current period, coupled with increased competition in the market has caused the directors to revise significantly the projections for the five year period referred to above and which has been used to assess impairment in previous financial periods.
As a result of this revision, an impairment loss of 98.1 million has been recognised against UniEuro goodwill in the current period.
