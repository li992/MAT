Contingent liability The Groups subsidiary responsible for a contract with Scottish Water, Caledonian Environmental Services plc CES, has received a claim from its Design and Construction Consortium DCC, primarily in respect of the DCCs additional costs attributed by it to non-conforming influent at the treatment works.
CES is defending this claim and has also issued a counterclaim against the DCC.
As non-conforming influent is ultimately the responsibility of the client, CES has protected its position by issuing a claim against Scottish Water.
The directors do not expect any material loss to arise as a result of these claims.
