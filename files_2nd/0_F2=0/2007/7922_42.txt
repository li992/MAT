28 Share based payments Equity-settled share option scheme The Company has a share option scheme for certain key employees of the Group.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the par value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is typically three years, although initial awards have a vesting period of two years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of five years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

In 2007, 50,000 options were exercised on 23 January 2007.
The aggregate of the estimated fair value of the options exercised on this date is 720p per share.
The total charged for the year against equity was US$6,022,000.
If this amount, US$3,936,000 was capitalised 2006: US$nil and US$2,086,000 2006: US$938,000 was charged to the income statement in relation to the fair value of the awards granted under the share options scheme measured at grant date using a Stochastic Model.
The inputs into the Stochastic model are as follows: 2007 2006 2006 2007 January 2 year 3 year May Grant Grant options options Weighted average share price 1295p 637p 690.5p 690.5p Weighted average exercise price 2.5p 2.5p 2.5p 2.5p Expected volatility 36.9% 39.0% 36% 39% Expected life 3 Years 3 years 2 years 3 years Risk-free rate 5.5% 5.1% 4.4% 4.5% Expected dividends 0% 0% 0% 0% Expected volatility is usually determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 2 years.
The Companys Ordinary Shares commenced trading on 2 April 2004, giving nearly three years worth of historic share price data at the time of the grant.
This data gives an historic share price volatility of 88.4% and 74.4% for the January and May 2007 awards respectively 97.5% for 2006 awards.
However, this includes the period immediately post flotation when a Companys share price is likely to be more volatile than its longer term average indeed the Companys volatility had fallen to 52% over the last six months prior to the January grant.
In these circumstances, IFRS 2 permits consideration of the historic volatility of other similar entities for which more trading activity is available.
The Directors therefore considered at the volatilities of other companies in the FTSE Oil and Gas producers sector over periods commensurate with the expected terms of the awards i. e. 2 and 3 years.
This showed that the average volatility of these companies is around 39.0% and 36.9% in the three years to January 2007 and May 2007 respectively.
Therefore the valuations were performed using this proxy volatility based on other similar companies.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Directors best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
