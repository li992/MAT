Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the financial statements except as noted below: Change in accounting policy share-based payments The Company has adopted UITF41 Scope of FRS 20 and UITF44 Group and Treasury Share Transactions in these financial statements.
When a parent grants share-based payments to employees of a subsidiary, UITF41 states that the parent receives services from employees indirectly through its subsidiary which should be accounted for as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary by the parent.
In these financial statements the Company has therefore recognised an increase in the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries for grants of equity instruments subsequent to 7 November 2002 and a corresponding credit to equity.
This has required the restatement of the comparative results, with a 3.6m increase in retained earnings.
The increase in retained earnings non-distributable in 2007 was 4.4m.
IMI plc recharges the full share-based payments charge in respect of each employee to the principal employing company.
Amounts recharged to subsidiaries are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in the subsidiary as this recharge is considered to form part of the determination of the net capital contribution from the parent in respect of the share-based payment arrangement.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards except for certain financial instruments as defined by FRS26 Financial instruments: measurement which are stated at fair value.
The Company has not presented a separate profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Under FRS1 Cash flow statements, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Company is included in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained in FRS8 Related party disclosures and has not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group.
Related party transactions with the Companys key management personnel are disclosed in note 28 to the Group financial statements.
The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and has taken the exemption under that standard from disclosure on the grounds that the Group financial statements contain disclosures in compliance with IFRS7.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation included in the profit and loss account.
Investments The Companys cost of investment in subsidiary undertakings is stated at the aggregate of a the cash consideration, b the nominal value of the shares issued as consideration when section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 applies and c in all other cases the market value of the Companys shares on the date they were issued as consideration.
IMI plc Annual Report 2007 103 company notes to the financial statements C1.
Significant accounting policies continued Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
Financial instruments The principal financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the Groups risk management policy.
Interest differentials are taken to net interest in the profit and loss account.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options are recharged to subsidiary undertakings.
The total amount recharged over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options at the date of grant is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the amount recharged to subsidiary undertakings.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Treasury shares The consideration paid by the Company on the acquisition of treasury shares is charged directly to retained earnings in the year of purchase.
If treasury shares are subsequently cancelled the nominal value of the cancelled shares is transferred from Share Capital to the capital redemption reserve.
Dividends or shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
