EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Scottish and Southern Energy Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Details of these schemes, all of which are equity settled, are as follows: i Discretionary share option scheme In the past, the Company operated this scheme, under which senior executives and staff were awarded share options.
The options granted to the senior executives from 1996 were subject to the performance criterion of normalised earnings per share over a three year period showing average compound annual growth rate of at least 2% above the increase in the UK retail price index for that year.
This criterion was met and any remaining discretionary share options are now exercisable.
This scheme has now ended and no options have been granted under this scheme since 1998. ii Savings-related share option schemes Sharesave This scheme gives employees the option to purchase shares in the Company at a discounted market price, subject to the employees remaining in employment for the term of the agreement.
Employees may opt to save between 5 and 250 per month for a period of 3 or 5 years.
At the end of this period, the employees have six months to exercise their options by using the cash saved including a bonus equivalent to interest.
If the option is not exercised, the funds may be withdrawn by the employee and the option expires.
iii Share Incentive Plan SIP This scheme allows employees the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company on a monthly basis.
Employees may nominate an amount between 10 and 125 to be deducted from their gross salary.
This is then used to purchase shares Partnership shares in the market on the final business day of each month.
These shares are then held in trust for a period of 5 years, at which point they are transferred at no further cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during the 5 years, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
In addition to the shares purchased on behalf of the employee, the Company will also match the purchase up to a maximum of 5 shares Matching shares per month.
Again these shares are held in trust for the five years until they are transferred to the employee.
If an employee leaves during the first three years, or removes his her partnership shares, these matching shares are forfeited.
In addition to the above, at 31 March 2005 the company made a special award of 50 free shares to all employees in employment at both 31 March and 20 August 2005 in recognition of their contribution to the success of the company.
Under the arrangements for the award, the shares will be held in trust for five years, at which point they will be transferred to the employees at no cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during years four and five, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
iv Deferred bonus scheme This scheme applied to senior managers and executive directors.
Those eligible were awarded an amount equal to their cash bonus for the period which was adjusted by a multiplier of between 0.7 and 1.35 depending on three factors, namely: relative performance in terms of Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three year period compared to the FTSE100: safety: and relative performance in terms of customer complaints as recorded by energywatch.
This amount was then used to purchase shares in the market which are held in trust on behalf of the employee for a period of three years, at which point the employee is entitled to exercise the award.
In addition to shares purchased using the adjusted bonus award, additional shares will also be purchased using any dividends received on the shares held by the trust.
If the employee resigns, they lose all outstanding awards.

EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued v Performance Share Plan Following approval at the AGM on 27 July 2006, this new share scheme has been introduced.
This scheme applies to executive directors and senior executives.
Those eligible are awarded a maximum value of share awards of 100% of base salary.
These awards will vest after three years to the extent that certain performance conditions are met.
These performance conditions are as follows: 50% of the award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR target relative to other FTSE100 companies over the performance period, with full vesting if the Company is above the 75th percentile and 30% vesting if the Company is at the median, with pro rata vesting between the median and 75th percentile and subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied on the underlying financial performance: the remaining 50% of the award is subject to an Earnings Per Share EPS growth target with full vesting occurring if adjusted EPS is 8% above RPI per annum and 30% vesting if adjusted EPS is 3% above RPI per annum with pro rata vesting between 3% and 8% above RPI.
There will be no vesting of the relevant portion of the award if the TSR minimum target is not met or the minimum EPS growth target is not achieved.
As allowed by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002, which were unvested at 1 January 2005, have been included.
A charge of 6.8M 2006 4.0M was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these schemes.
Of the outstanding options at the end of the year, none were exercisable.
The fair value of these shares at vesting, calculated using the Black-Scholes model, and the assumptions made in that model are as follows: July 2003 July 2004 July 2005 July 2006 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year Price 659p 667p 730p 739p 1,012p 1,023p 1,216p 1,226p Expected volatility 17% 17% 17% 17% 15% 15% 19% 19% Risk free rate 4.7% 4.8% 4.7% 4.8% 4.1% 4.2% 4.7% 4.7% Expected dividends 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% 4.2% 4.2% 4.8% 4.8% Term of the option 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs Underlying price at grant date 630p 630p 699p 699p 967p 967p 1,180p 1,180p Strike price 562p 562p 622p 622p 886p 886p 999p 999p Expected price volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 12 months.
Benefits under other schemes are not subject to valuation using the Black-Scholes model.
In addition to the sharesave schemes detailed above, at 31 March 2007 there were outstanding options under the 2001 sharesave issue.
Since the shares under this scheme were granted prior to 7 November 2002, they have not been included as permitted by the transitional rules under IFRS 1.
However, at 31 March 2007, the outstanding options are as follows: Number Date from Date of grant at 31 March 2007 Price pence which exercisable Expiry date October 2001 12,095 566 December 2006 May 2007 Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2007 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 92 for the year ended 31 March 2007 27.
