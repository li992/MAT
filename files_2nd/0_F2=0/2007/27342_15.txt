NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2007 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES New Star Asset Management Group PLC is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The parent formally EaglePilot PLC was incorporated on 10 January 2007, changed its name to New Star AM PLC on 5 April 2007 and on 12 June 2007 changed its name to New Star Asset Management Group PLC.
The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling rounded to the nearest thousand, the currency of the parent company.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1e ii.
a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except that the following assets are stated at their fair values: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Groups financial statements.
As the June 2007 scheme of arrangement did not result in any change in shareholders of the Group, the Group financial statements have been prepared adopting reverse acquisition accounting principles and section 131 merger relief to account for the scheme of arrangement and introduction of New Star Asset Management Group PLC as the new holding company as if it had always been the parent company of the Group.
Accordingly the Group financial statements do not recognise any goodwill on acquisition and include the costs of the Group prior to the scheme of arrangement.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1989, a separate income statement account has not been presented for the Company.
c New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will impact the Groups reported earnings in the period of initial application.
The Group plans to apply these standards in the reporting periods when they become effective.
The new standards include IFRS 8 Operating Segments which is effective for accounting periods after 1 January 2008.
The Group is reviewing the criteria for segmental information and its current position of one investment management segment.
d Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of New Star Asset Management Group PLC and each of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control begins to the date that control ceases.
The Groups Employee Benefit Trusts are included in the consolidated financial statements.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses are eliminated in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
42 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued e Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions denominated in foreign currencies arising during the accounting period are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate ruling at that date.
All exchange gains or losses are taken to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the measurement of fair value.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are shown as a separate component of equity.
f Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost represents purchase cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition.
Subsequent expenditure on property and equipment is only capitalised when it is probable that there will be future economic benefit.
All other expenditure is recognised as an expense in the Income statement.
The costs of purchasing and implementing software, together with associated relevant expenditure, are capitalised where the relevant conditions in IAS16 are met.
Software is recorded initially at cost and then depreciated on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
The depreciated cost of the software is reviewed each year end to determine whether there is an indication of impairment.
Any depreciation or impairment is charged in the income statement.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold improvements Period of the lease Computer equipment 3 years Software 3 years Furniture and equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 3 years The residual values and useful lives of the assets are reviewed at least annually.
If there is evidence of impairment then the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
Any depreciation or impairment is charged in the income statement as an expense.
g Intangible assets management contracts The cost of the rights to manage assets is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Where the management contracts do not have a defined life, an estimate of the useful life is made and the costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives.
Where the management contracts have a defined useful life, the cost is amortised over the period of the contract.
The amortised cost of these management contracts is reviewed annually to ensure no impairment has occurred.
Any amortisation or impairment is charged in the income statement as an expense.
43 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Intangible assets management contracts continued The estimated useful lives for the retail contracts acquired in 2003 was 6 years and for the Family Assurance and Exeter Financials Fund was based on the finite life of the contract, which is 4 years and 33 months respectively.
h Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss on available-for-sale financial assets is recognised only when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and it is considered very unlikely that the carrying amount will be recovered.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that has been recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement even though the financial asset has not been derecognised.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement for an impaired asset is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
i Financial instruments i Derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
These contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges and changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffective part of the hedge is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Derivative instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
ii Investments Non current investments are designated as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any movement in fair value being recognised in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When the investment is sold or written off, the cumulative gain or loss dealt with through this reserve is recognised in the income statement.
iii Stock of shares units The stock of shares units represents shares held in the Groups open-ended investment companies and unit trusts.
They are held for trading and are stated at fair value, with any movement in fair value being recognised immediately in the income statement.
j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses.
44 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
l Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at amortised cost.
m Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are held at amortised cost with any difference between amortised cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
n Employee benefits defined contribution plans The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable in accordance with contractual terms.
o Share-based payments The Group operates schemes that allow employees, including Directors, to purchase shares in the Company.
The employee purchases the shares with a loan advanced by one of the Groups EBTs.
The employees have charged the relevant shares held by them in favour of an EBT by way of security for their obligations to the EBT.
The employees obligations to pay or repay sums to the EBT are of a limited recourse nature as the employees liability is capped at the proceeds of sale of the shares charged by them.
The Group calculates the fair value of these awards using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value is recognised as an employee cost in the income statement over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares, being the period from the date of grant.
The amount recognised is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual numbers of shares that the employees become unconditionally entitled to.
The Group also operates share option schemes that allow employees, including Directors, to purchase shares in the Company.
The fair value of the options is measured on the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised in the income statement is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual number of options that vest.
All schemes are classified as being equity settled.
Surpluses in the Groups EBTs are recognised in the income statement when paid.
p Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when there is a current obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that a future outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
A property provision for lease obligations is recognised where the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from the lease are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the lease.
q EBT reserve The EBT reserve represents realised profits, shares at cost held by the Groups EBTs less loans secured by shares sold by the Groups EBTs.
45 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued r Revenue Revenue comprises management and advisory fees, gross performance fees, gains or losses arising on the Groups holdings in shares of open-ended investment companies OEICs and unit trusts and property acquisition fees.
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group and it can be reliably measured.
To the extent that the Group collects and pays amounts in respect of the services provided to investors by intermediaries upon the sale of units, then the amounts received and paid are not included in the Income Statement.
The following specific recognition criteria have been adopted: i Management and advisory fees Management and advisory fees are recognised over the period in which the service is provided.
ii Front-end fees Where front-end fees are received for the sale of OEICs and unit trusts the net retained fee is recognised on sale.
iii Performance fees Performance fees are recognised when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise.
This is at the end of the performance period.
iv Gains or losses arising on the Groups holdings in shares of open-ended investment companies and unit trusts Where holdings are classified as held for trading then any movement in fair value is recognised immediately.
v Property acquisition fees Property acquisition fees are recognised using the percentage completion method.
s Expenses i Fees and commissions Fees and commissions in respect of the management of investment management contracts are recognised over the period the service is provided.
Included in fees and commissions is the share of the management and performance fees received payable to third parties including fund managers.
ii Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
iii Exceptional items An item is considered to be an exceptional item if it does not usually occur in the normal course of the business and, or it is unusually large as to mislead a reader if it is not shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
t Finance income and finance cost Interest income and expense are calculated using the effective yield basis.
Finance income comprises interest on short-term deposits and finance cost comprises interest paid on borrowings and the amortised transaction costs on borrowings.
u Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
46 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued u Taxation continued Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is probable that there will be future taxable profits available against which to offset the asset.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
v Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
w Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements The preparation of the financial statements necessitates the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements.
These estimates, assumptions and judgements affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date as well as affecting the reported income and expenses for the year.
Although the estimates are based on managements knowledge and best judgement of information and financial data, the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that and prior periods, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The significant estimates and judgements in drawing up the Groups consolidated financial statements are in connection with any impairment and the principal assumptions underlying the valuation of the Groups share-based payments.
x Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
i Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
ii Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
47 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2 REVENUE SEGMENTAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The Group operates as a single asset management business, and the directors do not consider the different sources of revenue and geographic regions within the business as separate business segments within the meaning of IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
The risks and returns to the Group across the different income sources and geographic regions are not significantly different and it is the clients themselves who have the different risk return profiles.
All of the Groups clients are consuming the same service asset management and the fund managers may manage funds across two or more different income sources and geographic regions.
On this basis New Star considers itself to be a single segment investment management business.
3 EXCEPTIONAL IPO COSTS Exceptional IPO costs in 2007 totalling 2,388,000 relate to the costs incurred in respect of the admission of the shares in New Star Asset Management Group PLC to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchanges main market for listed securities and the costs of the capital reorganisation.

For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate risk, see note 24.
2007 2006 000 000 Non-current liabilities Bank loan 266,249 On 19 April 2007, New Star Asset Management Group PLC entered into a loan facility agreement with the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland for a facility of 350 million to enable the Company to make the payments to New Star shareholders under the 2007 scheme.
The term loan is repayable in full on 30 June 2013.
300 million was drawn down on the term loan in June 2007 and the balance at the end of the year was 270 million.
The loan is charged at a floating rate of LIBOR plus up to 1.50%.
The costs of arranging the financing, 4,120,000, have been offset against the debt in accordance with IAS 39 and are being amortised over the life of the debt.
The Company has entered into a reducing balance interest rate swap IRS on 300 million and an interest rate cap on 50 million.
The purpose of the IRS is to exchange floating for fixed interest payments.
The Company also has a revolving credit facility of 35 million available for the Groups general working capital requirement.

The Group has capital commitments for settlement after 31 December 2007 of 700,000 in relation to leasehold improvements 2006: nil other than those already disclosed in note 12.
58 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 22 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension scheme The Group operates a defined contribution scheme.
The pension charge for the year represents contributions payable by the Group to the fund and amounted to 3,316,591 2006: 2,883,309.
Contributions amounting to 353,995 2006: 236,998 were payable to the scheme at the year end and are included in creditors.
Share-based payments Pre 1 November 2005 Share Scheme The Group operates an employee share scheme involving the Groups EBTs, the trustee of which is New Star Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The EBTs have subscribed in cash for shares and then sold those shares to employees at market value on terms that require employees to pay 0.01 per share initially, with any balance due being payable on disposal of the underlying shares or, if earlier, 18 November 2009 or the date on which the Groups interim results for the period to 30 June 2009 are announced.
Alternatively employees have subscribed in cash for shares, with the EBTs having made cash loans available to the employees to enable them to discharge their subscription obligations.
These cash loans are repayable on disposal of the underlying shares or, if earlier, 18 November 2009 or the date on which the Groups interim results for the period to 30 June 2009 are announced.
Of the shares held by employees, a certain number are subject to redemption or repurchase by the EBTs if performance criteria are not met.
All shares held by employees, to the extent they have not vested, are forfeited on the employee leaving the Group in circumstances rendering them a bad leaver although the Board has discretion to waive this provision in whole or part.
In all cases, employees have charged the relevant shares held by them in favour of an EBT by way of security for their obligations to that EBT.
The employees obligations to pay or repay sums to the EBTs are of a limited recourse nature as each employees liability is capped at the proceeds of sale of the shares charged by him.
At the year end, the EBTs were owed approximately 15.3 million 2006: 28.4 million by way of deferred purchase price or subscription loans.
As a result of the limited recourse nature of the employees liability, the shares sold and related loans provided by the EBTs have not been recognised but rather the cost of these shares has been deducted from capital employed in other reserves.
The facility extended to the EBTs by the Group has been repaid during the year 2006: 30.2 million.
Provided that employees are able to sell shares at varying prices up to 177p per share, the EBTs should recover the sums owed to them.
The EBTs made loans to directors and employees to meet certain tax liabilities relating to shares in the Company.
The total loans outstanding together with interest accrued at the year end amounted to 6.6 million 2006: 9.3 million.
On Admission to AIM various restrictions were imposed on the directors and employees for the disposal of their shares.
These restrictions were transferred to the ordinary shares as part of the Scheme and as at 31 December 2007 45% of the original ordinary shares are subject to restrictions.
On 18 November 2008 or if earlier the announcement of the Companys interim results for the period to 30 June 2008 a further 15% of the individuals original holding will become free of the restrictions on disposal: and on 18 November 2009 or if earlier the announcement of the Companys interim results for the period to June 2009 the remaining 30% of such ordinary shares will become free of restrictions on disposal.
59 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 22 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued If an employee ceases to be employed by the Group their shares still under the above restrictions are forfeited unless the employee is deemed a good leaver, that is if the employee ceases to be employed by the Group due to death or redundancy.
The Board has general discretion to waive these restrictions.
Under IFRS 2 there is a requirement to spread the fair value of these arrangements as a charge to the income statement.
The fair value of the shares issued has been calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share incentive at grant, taking into account any market based performance conditions and expected vesting of shares issued.

New Star 2007 Discretionary Share Option Scheme On 18 April 2007 the Group replaced the New Star 2005 Discretionary Share Option Scheme with the 2007 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Options over ordinary shares can be granted to all employees including full-time executive directors.
The Share Option Scheme is divided into two parts, an HMRC-approved scheme and an unapproved scheme.
The acquisition price payable on the option will be the mid-market price per ordinary share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the grant.
Options will be exercisable between three and 10 years and based on the individual remaining in employment by the Company.
The following share options granted under the Scheme were in place at 31 December 2007: Date option granted Option Number price per share of options Total 1 7 November 2005 2.095 542,320 1 3 April 2006 3.934 448,351 1 25 September 2006 3.753 330,226 1 3 April 2007 4.280 894,022 19 July 2007 4.435 2,226,317 2 October 2007 3.533 473,500 1 The option price has been rebased for the four-for-five share reorganisation as part of the scheme.

At the year end, the Group had 4,524,000 2006: 15,052,000 seed capital, excluding the stock of shares units, in funds managed by a Group Company note 12.
All amounts outstanding from related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash.
No guarantees have been given or received.
No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of any amounts owed by related parties.
24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups financial instruments comprise fixed asset investments, cash, borrowings and various items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The carrying value of these financial instruments are as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Assets Financial assets Non-derivative investments available for sale 4,524 15,052 Derivative financial assets hedge accounting 736 Stock of shares available for sale 681 663 Cash and cash equivalents loans and receivables 29,237 19,237 Trade and other receivables loans and receivables 99,006 103,255 Liabilities Derivative financial liabilities hedge accounting 7,502 Trade and other payables liabilities at amortised cost 101,074 80,832 Long-term borrowings liabilities at amortised cost 266,249 Other non-interest bearing liabilities liabilities at amortised cost 66 129 62 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The fair value of the above financial instruments equates to its carrying amounts, with the exception of long-term borrowings, where its fair value is the amount due to the bank of 270 million compared to the carrying value recorded at amortised cost.
The Groups non-derivative investments are entered into for the purposes of seeding newly-launched New Star funds.
The Groups income is derived mainly from funds managed for third parties.
The value of those funds is mainly dependent on market levels, the performance of the funds, net new business and exchange rates on overseas assets.
The Groups main risk arises from the level of the markets in which it invests and to a lesser extent credit risk, foreign currency, liquidity and interest rate risk.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
a Available-for-sale securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices from financial institutions at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs.
b Interest rate hedges The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on the quoted market price from the bank at the balance sheet date.
c Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Asset valuation risk Asset valuation risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group, either as a result of an asset not meeting its expected value or through the decline of assets under management generating lower fees.
The principal exposures of the Group are in respect of its seed investments in its own funds.
Lower management fee revenues could result from a reduction in asset values.
This risk is partially mitigated by asset class diversification.
The market value of the Groups available-for-sale investments on the balance sheet at 31 December 2007 was 4.5 million 2006: 11.8 million.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations.
This would be the risk of insufficient cash resources and liquid assets, including bank facilities, being available to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The cash generated from its operations during the year has been managed to ensure all regulatory capital requirements are met while continuing to repay the bank debt.
Given the cash generative nature of the Groups operations and the availability of short-term facilities, the Group has been able to ensure that any short-term requirements have been easily covered.
63 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is the risk that arises from the default of the counterparty.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, trade and other receivables.
The Group trades with only recognised creditworthy third parties.
These represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets and are represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of trade debtors relate to the groups open-ended products, where the risk is reduced to a market risk.
The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate and currency risk profiles The interest rate profiles of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2007 were as follows: Not directly exposed to interest Floating rate Fixed rate rate risk Total 2007 2007 2007 2007 000 000 000 000 Financial assets Financial asset investments 4,524 4,524 Cash and cash equivalents 29,237 29,237 Derivatives financial instruments 736 736 29,237 5,260 34,497 Financial liabilities Borrowings 270,000 270,000 Hedging derivative 275,000 275,000 Net 34,237 275,000 5,260 235,503 The interest rate profiles of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2006 were as follows: Not directly exposed to interest Floating rate rate risk Total 2006 2006 2006 000 000 000 Financial assets Financial asset investments 15,715 15,715 Cash and cash equivalents 19,237 19,237 19,237 15,715 34,952 The floating rate financial liabilities comprise interest bearing loans and borrowings, further details of which are included in note 17.
As a result of its bank loan, the Company entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap as described in note 17.
In order to reduce the Groups exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates LIBOR the interest rate swap was taken out to exchange the floating for fixed interest rate payments.
The derivative hedging instrument was based on the initial value of the loan 300 million with a quarterly reducing hedge amount based on an estimated repayment schedule to 30 March 2012.
The interest rate cap was taken out to protect the downside risk of the cashflow being less than expected.
The interest rate cap allows the Group to protect 50 million of debt at a rate of 6.25% effective from June 2008 with a maturity date of 30 March 2012.
64 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest rate and currency risk profiles continued The hedges are deemed effective under the requirements of IAS 39 and are held at fair value in equity.
The main interest rate risk for the Group is the borrowings, which the Group has covered by the interest rate hedges.
Any surplus cash will be used to repay the debt.
The financial assets not directly exposed to interest rate risk do not have a maturity date and principally comprise available-for-sale investments and financial assets.
The floating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and deposit balances, which earn interest at rates that fluctuate according to money market rates.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group is subject to short-term foreign exchange movements between the calculation date of fees in currencies other than sterling and the actual date of receipt.
The Group holds cash balances in US dollars, euros and Canadian dollars as a result of earning revenues in these currencies.
Foreign exchange risk is managed by converting surplus overseas currency into sterling, ensuring that regulatory capital requirements and foreign currency expenditure requirements are met.
The currency profiles of the Groups net foreign currency monetary assets at 31 December were as follows: Functional currency of USD Euro Sterling Other Total the operating company 000 000 000 000 000 2007 Sterling 5,967 677 439 7,083 US Dollar 1,321 929 15 2,265 Euro 852 5,048 5,900 6,819 1,998 5,977 454 15,248 2006 Sterling 6,339 1,642 822 8,803 US Dollar 1,514 789 3 2,306 Euro 519 281 800 6,858 3,156 1,070 825 11,909 If sterling were to strengthen weaken by 5% against all other operating currencies the exposure at the 31 December 2007 would be a profit loss to the income statement of approximately 726,000 2006: 567,000.
Capital risk requirement The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure it can continue as a going concern and to manage the individual regulated companies capital requirements whilst providing sufficient returns for shareholders.
During the year, the Company utilised the Groups surplus capital and raised additional debt for the purposes of the scheme of arrangement and return of capital.
The debt is due to be repaid in June 2013, although there is the ability to repay earlier.
This ensures that significant cash resources generated can be utilised on business opportunities where required.
65 NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The individual subsidiary companies all maintain sufficient net assets and all regulated subsidiaries meet their capital adequacy requirements.
The Group regularly reviews its forecasted regulatory capital position to ensure that it has sufficient headroom to enable this to be maintained under various scenarios.
The total movement in equity for the year is shown in note 20.
25 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS Dividends The board of directors has proposed a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 of 1.0p per share 2006: 5.0p amounting to 2.3 million.
The proposed dividend was proposed after the year end and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
26 CONTINGENCIES The Group has no contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2007 2006: nil.
27 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The estimates and assumptions that could have a risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities relate to intangible and financial assets.
The Group tests annually to ascertain whether the intangible and financial assets have suffered an impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 1 g. 28 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUPERVISION The Group has received a waiver from the consolidated capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority.
