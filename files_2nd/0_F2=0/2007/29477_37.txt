Sensitivity analysis The table below sets out the sensitivity of the profit and net assets to key assumptions.
The analysis reflects the change in the variable assumption shown while all other variables assumptions are left unchanged.
In practice variables assumptions may change at the same time as some may be correlated for example, an increase in interest rates may also result in an increase in expenses if the increase reflects higher inflation.
It should also be noted that in some instances sensitivities are non-linear.
