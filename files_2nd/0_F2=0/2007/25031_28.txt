Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as own shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same profit figure as that used in basic earnings per share and by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
