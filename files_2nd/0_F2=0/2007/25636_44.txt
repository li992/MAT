Provision is made for the future rental cost of vacant property.
In calculating the provision required, account is taken of the duration of the lease and any recovery of cost achievable from subletting.
Property provisions occur principally in the USA and UK and relate to a variety of lease commitments.
The longest lease terms for each country are to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
Litigation provisions At any point in time the Group can be involved in a variety of litigation issues.
A balance sheet provision is established in respect of such issues when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
The Group analyses its litigation exposures based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
Where appropriate the Group also provides for the cost of defending or initiating such matters.
The outcome of the currently pending and future proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.
Thus, an adverse decision in a current or future lawsuit could result in additional costs that are not covered, either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and are in excess of the presently established provisions.
It is possible therefore that the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the JLT Group could be materially affected by the unfavourable outcome of litigation.
"Where a litigation provision has been made it is stated gross of any third party recovery, all such recoveries are included as ""other debtors"" within trade and other receivables."
At 31st December 2007, in connection with certain litigation matters, the Group's litigation provisions include an amount of 0.2 million 2006: 10.2 million to reflect this gross basis and the corresponding insurance recovery has been included within trade and other receivables.
This presentation has had no effect on the Consolidated Income Statement for the period ended 31st December 2007 2006: nil.
Deferred consideration Provision is made in respect of additional consideration payable following the initial completion of an acquisition.
The value of the deferred consideration may be revised from time to time prior to final settlement.
Acquisition integration provisions Represent costs expected to be incurred as a result of combining and restructuring operations following a acquisition.
These costs are not associated with the ongoing activities of the company.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 37 the Group has discounted certain provisions to their present value.
The discount rate applied to each provision is appropriate to the nature of the provision and the location in which the liability occurs.
"The interest charge, represents the unwinding of the provision discounting, and has been included as part of ""Finance costs"" within the consolidated income statement."
