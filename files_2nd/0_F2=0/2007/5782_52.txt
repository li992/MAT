Shares issued were valued at market price at the date of acquisition.
The goodwill arises through the strengthening of the Groups geographical footprint, product pull-through opportunities with new clients and the value of the acquired workforce.
The revenue and operating profit of PWS for the year has not been disclosed as integration of the business has made this impracticable.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 April 2006, total Group revenue for the year would have been 561.8m, and operating profit for the year would have been 70.4m, after deducting intangible asset amortisation arising on consolidation of 6.9m.
