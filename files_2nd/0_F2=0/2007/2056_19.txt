FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Supplementary information gas and oil unaudited 121 On 20 December 2007, the Groups registration with the SEC was terminated and the Groups SEC reporting obligations also ceased with effect from that date.
BG Group continues voluntarily to use the SEC definition of proved reserves to report proved gas and oil reserves and to disclose the unaudited supplementary information detailed on the following pages 121 to 125, prepared on the basis of FAS 69.
BG Groups strategy aims to connect competitively priced gas to high value markets.
Hydrocarbon reserves, and gas in particular, are developed in relation to the markets which they are intended to supply.
Based on the above, the information below is disclosed on the basis of the following geographical areas: i the United Kingdom, ii Atlantic Basin, iii Asia and the Middle East, and iv Rest of the World.
The countries in the Atlantic Basin, Asia and the Middle East and the Rest of the World geographical areas are grouped as shown below to reflect the nature of the markets for BG Groups interests in these countries: Atlantic Basin Canada, Egypt, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and the USA Asia and the Middle East China, India, Kazakhstan, Oman, Thailand, Israel and areas of Palestinian Authority Rest of the World Algeria, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Italy, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Norway, Spain and Tunisia A PROVED RESERVES Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of gas and oil which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves are those quantities that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where relatively major expenditure is required for completion.
Proved undeveloped reserves comprise total proved reserves less total proved developed reserves.
The net movement in proved reserves during the year includes extensions, discoveries and reclassifications 63.3 mmboe, additions and disposals 8.5 mmboe decrease and revisions to previous estimates 55.1 mmboe.
Included within these movements is the net effect of changes in year end prices 117.0 mmboe decrease.
Production in the period was 220.1 mmboe net of Canadian royalty production of 0.2 mmboe.
Gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly since estimation of reserves involves subjective judgment.
Therefore, all estimates are subject to revision.
Increases in year end gas and oil prices in fields subject to Production Sharing Contracts PSCs may result in lower entitlements leading to reductions in proved reserves.

com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 123 B STANDARDISED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS The following tables set out the standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved gas and oil reserves and report the causes of changes in the standardised measure of the cash flows relating to reserves.
Future cash inflows have been computed by reference to the Groups estimate of third-party prices ruling at the year end and estimates of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flow information presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
The disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.

RESERVES AND RESOURCES Proved reserves BG Group utilises the SEC definition of proved reserves.
Further information on proved reserves can be found on page 121.
Probable reserves Probable reserves are those unproven reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggest are more likely than not to be recoverable.
Taken together with proved reserves, proved plus probable reserves comprise the best estimate of reserves for an asset and will normally be used in business planning.
Un-booked resources Un-booked resources are defined by BG Group as the best estimate of recoverable hydrocarbons where commercial and or technical maturity are such that project sanction is not expected within the next three years.
Risked exploration Risked exploration resources are defined by BG Group as the best estimate mean value of recoverable hydrocarbons in a prospect multiplied by the Chance of Success.
The term gross reserves means gross Proved reserves plus gross Probable reserves.
For details of BG Groups Reserves and Resources as at 31 December 2007, see table on page 17.
