18 Gas, P ower and Renewables Supplied by nature, harnessed by BP BPs ambitions to build an international wind business moved forward significantly in 2007 with the development of three projects on two continents.
The 300MW Cedar Creek wind farm in Colorado uses 274 turbines to generate enough carbonfree electricity to supply 90,000 average American homes.
This should soon be followed by the 60MW Silver Star I wind project in Texas, utilizing some of the largest wind turbines built in the US.
In India, the start-up of BPs first wind project in Asia, the 40MW Dhule facility in Maharashtra, is expected to avoid the production of up to 70,000 tonnes of CO 2 annually, compared with a conventional coal-fired power plant.

BP accelerates its position BPs newest LNG carrier, in the solar marketplace the British Emerald, is expected to avoid CO emissions 2 Already one of the leading players in of up to the solar industry, BP is accelerating its growth plans.
In 2007, we began an 36,000 tonnes expansion programme in the US, Spain annually and India that is expected to more than triple cell production capacity.
Our aim compared with other LNG carriers is to offer customers solar electricity at of similar size.
