6 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised on a geographical basis into four main sales regions: Asia Pacic, Americas, Central Eastern and Southern Europe CES and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa WEMEA.
Corporate functions and Research and Development operations are principally based in the UK and Sweden and are therefore not included in the sales regions analysis.
Each of these operating regions are organised and managed separately due to the differing local requirements in each market and therefore these are the primary segments.
The Group operates in one business segment: that of the supply of Engineering IT Solutions that supports the creation and operation of major capital assets such as power plants, process plants and ships of both naval and commercial type.
Following the acquisition of Tribon in 2004, the Group has successfully completed the integration of the Tribon operations into the AVEVA Group structure, which has included merging of the intellectual property to develop Vantage Marine, a new product which combines the Tribon and AVEVA Technology, integration and rationalisation of its ofces into the AVEVA ofce network and rationalisation of headcount.
