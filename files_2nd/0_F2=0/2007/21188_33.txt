The value of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme deficit has been notionally allocated between segments, based on current funding and the life proportion has been included within the long-term business net assets on an EEV basis.
Effective from 31 December 2006, the pension fund deficit notionally allocated to long-term business is net of the proportion of funding borne by the UK with-profit funds.
The long term business net assets on an EEV basis have been restated to include the minority interest on property investment vehicles held in the UK.
This change recognises that the embedded value reflects these investments post minority interest, whereas IFRS reports these investments gross.
Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Basis of preparation EEV basis The summarised consolidated income statement and balance sheet on pages 247 to 249 present the Groups results and financial position for the life and related businesses on the European Embedded Value EEV basis and for its non-life businesses on the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
The EEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the EEV Principles introduced by the CFO Forum in May 2004 and the Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures published by the CFO Forum in October 2005.
The Directors consider that the EEV methodology represents a more meaningful basis of reporting the value of the Groups life and related businesses and the drivers of performance, than IFRS methodology.
This basis allows for the impact of uncertainty in the future investment returns more explicitly and is consistent with the way the business is priced and managed.
At the time the Group adopted EEV principles in 2004, its approach to establishing economic assumptions, including investment returns, required capital and discount rates, was reviewed by Tillinghast, a firm of actuarial consultants.
The approach used by the Group is based on the established capital asset pricing model theory and remains in line with EEV principles and guidance.
The results for 2007 and 2006 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
Their report in respect of 2007 is included in the Report and Accounts on page 246 of this document.
Covered business The EEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
The Groups definition of new business under EEV includes contracts that meet the definition of non-participating investment contracts under IFRS.
Covered business includes the Groups share of our joint venture operations including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG and our operations in India, China, Turkey, Malaysia and Taiwan.
In addition, the results of Group companies providing significant administration, investment management and other services and of Group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
New business premiums New business premiums include: premiums arising from the sales of new contracts during the year: non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums: and expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are generally considered to represent new business in certain circumstances, including where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include 251 contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-defined and reasonably predictable.
Financial statements For group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Foreign exchange adjustments Embedded value and other balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies have been translated to sterling using the appropriate closing exchange rate.
New business contribution and other income statement items have been translated using an average exchange rate for the relevant period.
The exchange rates adopted in this announcement are shown on page 132.
EEV Methodology Overview Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash flows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another life business, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
Profits are then grossed up for tax at the full rate of corporation tax for the UK and at an appropriate rate for each of the other countries based on opening year tax rates.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued EEV methodology continued Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity basis.
The level of required capital for each business, which ranges between 100% and 150% of the EU minimum solvency requirement for our main European businesses and 250% of the EU minimum equivalent solvency requirements in the US, reflects the level of capital considered by the Directors to be appropriate to manage the business, allowing for our internal assessment of the level of market, insurance and operating risk inherent in the underlying products.
The same definition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus comprises the market value of shareholder assets in excess of local statutory reserves and required capital.
Value of in-force covered business The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
In the UK, shareholders distributable profits arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using best estimate assumptions of future experience.
In overseas businesses generally there are similar requirements restricting payments to shareholders from life businesses.
The value of in-force covered business includes an allowance for the impact of financial options and guarantees arising from best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value and from additional costs related to the variability of investment returns the time value.
The intrinsic value is included in the underlying value of the in-force covered business using deterministic assumptions.
The time value of financial options and guarantees has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques.
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash flows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
The time value is determined by deducting the average value of shareholder cash flows under these economic scenarios from the deterministic shareholder value under best estimate assumptions.
The cost of holding required capital is the difference between the required capital and the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate of the projected release of the required capital and investment earnings on the assets deemed to back the required capital.
Where the required capital is covered by policyholder assets, for example in the UK with-profit funds, 252 there is no impact of cost of capital on shareholder value.
The assets regarded as covering the required capital are those that the operation deems appropriate.
Financial statements The value of in-force covered business includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
Risk discount rates Under the EEV methodology, a risk discount rate RDR is required to express a stream of expected future distributable profits as a single value at a particular date the present value.
It is the interest rate that an investment equal to the present value would have to earn in order to be able to replicate exactly the stream of future profits.
The RDR is a combination of a risk free rate to reflect the time value of money plus a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
In particular, a risk margin is added to allow for the risk that expected additional returns on certain asset classes e. g. equities are not achieved.
Risk discount rates for our life businesses have been calculated using a risk margin based upon a Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The Group WACC is calculated using a gross risk free interest rate, an equity risk margin, a market assessed risk factor beta, and an allowance for the gearing impact of debt financing including subordinated debt on a market value basis.
The market assessed risk factor captures the markets view of the effect of all types of risk on our business, including operational and other non-economic risk.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 EEV methodology continued The RDR is only one component of the overall allowance for risk in EEV calculations.
Risk is also allowed for in the cost of holding statutory reserving margins, additional required capital and in the time value of options and guarantees.
Hence to derive the RDR the Group WACC is adjusted to reflect the average level of required capital assumed to be held, and to reflect the explicit valuation of the time value of options and guarantees.
In order to derive risk discount rates for each of our life businesses, the adjusted Group WACC is expressed as a risk margin in excess of the gross risk free interest rate used in the WACC calculation as described above.
This risk margin is used for all our main businesses including the US.
Business-specific discount rates are then calculated as the sum of this risk margin and the appropriate local gross risk free rate at the valuation date, based on returns on government bonds.
A common risk free rate, and hence a common RDR, is used for all of our businesses within the Eurozone.
Additional country-specific risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reflect additional economic, political and business-specific risk.
For example, risk margins ranging from 3.7% to 8.7% are applied to the Groups eastern European and Asian operations.
Within each business, a constant RDR has been applied in all future time periods and in each of the economic scenarios underlying the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees.
At each valuation date, the risk margin is reassessed based on current economic factors and is updated only if a significant change has occurred.
In particular, changes in risk profile arising from movements in asset mix are allowed for via the updated risk margin calculation.
Following the review of the risk margin at 31 December 2006, the Directors decided to leave the life embedded value risk margin unchanged at 2.7%.
The market assessed risk factor beta had reduced since the initial risk margin was originally set, implying a reduction of the risk in the life business.
Following the review at 31 December 2007, the Directors have decided to maintain the life embedded value risk margin at 2.7%.
Management will keep the risk margin under review and will make adjustments as necessary to reflect past trends and future expected trends in the riskiness of the life business, based on the beta.
The sensitivity disclosures on page 265 indicate the impact to the embedded value that would arise for a change in the risk discount rate.
Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the Groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benefits and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders benefits and shareholders reflect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Where under certain economic scenarios additional shareholder injections are 253 required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
Financial statements Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between our life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements has been included in results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the EEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the Groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the EEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and new business contribution calculations for the relevant territory, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing balance sheets, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued Components of life EEV return The life EEV return comprises the following components: new business contribution written during the period including value added between the point of sale and end of the period: the profit from existing business equal to: the expected return on the value of the in-force covered business at the beginning of the period, experience variances caused by the differences between the actual experience during the period and expected experience based on the operating assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: the impact of changes in operating assumptions including risk margins: the expected investment return on the shareholders' net worth, based upon assumptions applying at the start of the year: investment return variances caused by differences between the actual return in the period and the expected return based on economic assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: and the impact of changes in economic assumptions in the period.
The life EEV operating return comprises the first three of these components and is calculated using economic assumptions as at the start of the year and operating demographic, expenses and tax assumptions as at the end of the year.

254 Financial New business contribution statements The table below sets out the premium volumes, the contribution from and the resulting margin achieved on new business written by the life and related businesses.
The contribution generated by new business written during the year is the present value of the projected stream of after tax distributable profit from that business.
New business contribution before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution after tax at the full corporation tax rate for UK business and at appropriate rates of tax for other countries.
New business contribution has been calculated using the same economic assumptions as those used to determine the embedded value as at the start of the year and operating assumptions used to determine the embedded value as at the end of the year, and is rolled forward to the end of the financial year.
New business contribution is shown before and after the effect of required capital, calculated on the same basis as for in-force covered business.
New business sales are expressed on two bases: annual premium equivalent APE and the present value of new business premiums PVNBP.
The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the year plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate new business contribution, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
New business margin represents the ratio of new business contribution to PVNBP, expressed as a percentage.

There are no minorities in the United Kingdom or North America.
Principal economic assumptions 261 Deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each Financial reporting year.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields to obtain statements investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property and to produce risk discount rates.
Additional countryspecific risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reflect additional economic, political and business-specific risk, which result in the application of risk margins ranging from 3.7% to 8.7% in our eastern European and Asian business operations.
Expense inflation is derived as a fixed margin above a local measure of long-term price inflation.
Risk free rates and price inflation have been harmonised across territories within the Euro currency zone, except for expense inflation in Ireland where significant differences remain.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
Investment return assumptions are generally derived by major product class, based on hypothecating the assets at the valuation date.
Future assumed reinvestment rates are consistent with implied market returns at 31 December 2007.
Rates have been derived using rates from the current yield curve at a duration based on the term of the liabilities, or directly from forward yield curves where considered appropriate.
Assumptions about future investment mix are consistent with long-term plans.
In most cases, the investment mix is assumed to continue unchanged throughout the projection period.
The changes in assumptions between reporting dates reflect the actual movements in risk free yields in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone and other territories.
262 For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life Financial company.
Future returns on corporate fixed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an adjustment statements for credit risk.
Following the change made to the required capital in Norwich Union Annuity Limited, required capital in the United Kingdom is now 100% EU minimum for all life companies.
Required capital in Spain is 125% EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.
The level of required capital for the US business is 250% of the risk based capital, at the company action level, set by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The required capital is equivalent to 5% of the insurance liabilities on a local regulatory basis which is broadly equivalent to the required capital we hold for our main European businesses.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions and Avivas medium-term bonus plans.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
Stochastic calculations The time value of options and guarantees calculation allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix and bonus rates.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
This section describes the models used to generate future investment simulations and gives some sample statistics for the simulations used.
Two separate models have been used, for the UK businesses and for International businesses, to better reflect the characteristics of the businesses.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Principal economic assumptions continued United Kingdom Model Overall asset returns have been generated assuming that the portfolio total return has a lognormal distribution.
The mean and standard deviation of the overall asset return have been calculated using the evolving asset mix of the fund and assumptions over the mean and standard deviation of each asset class, together with the correlations between them.
Asset classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds.
The most significant assumption is the distribution of future long-term interest rates, since this is the most important factor in the cost of guaranteed annuity options.
Summary statistics The following table sets out the mean and standard deviations StDev of future returns at 31 December 2007 for the three most significant asset classes.
Interest rates are assumed to have a lognormal distribution with an annualised standard deviation of 11.5% p. a. for the natural logarithm of the interest rate.
Means have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, averaging the accumulation across th all simulations, and converting the result to an equivalent annual rate by taking the n root of the average accumulation minus one.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, taking the natural logarithm of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
Depending on the duration of the portfolio.
For the UK, the statistics are the same over all projection horizons.
Assumptions are also required for correlations between asset classes.
These have been set based on an assessment of historical data.
Returns for corporate fixed interest investments in each scenario are equal to the return on Government bonds plus a fixed additional amount, based on current spreads less a margin for credit risk.
International Model Government nominal interest rates are generated by a model that projects a full yield curve at annual intervals.
The model assumes that the logarithm of the short rate follows a mean reverting process subject to two normally distributed random shocks.
This ensures that nominal interest rates are always positive, the distribution of future interest rates remains credible, and the model can be calibrated to give a good fit to the initial yield curve.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one year bonds plus an excess return.
The excess return is assumed to have a lognormal distribution.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although 263 these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
Financial Asset classes statements The most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various durations.
In some businesses equities are also an important asset class.
Summary statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations of future euro and US dollar returns at 31 December 2007 for the three most significant asset classes: equities in the case of euro, short-term bonds defined to be of one year duration and long-term bonds defined to be ten year zero coupon bonds.
In the accumulation of ten year bonds, it is assumed that these are held for one year, sold as nine year bonds then the proceeds are reinvested in ten year bonds, although in practice businesses follow more complex asset strategies or tend to adopt a buy and hold strategy.
Correlations between asset classes have been set using the same approach as described for the United Kingdom.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, taking the natural th logarithm of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued Principal economic assumptions continued Other assumptions Taxation Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered, except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience.
Where appropriate, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the EEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to businesses included in the European Embedded Value calculations, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and new business contribution.
Valuation of debt Borrowings in the EEV consolidated balance sheet are valued on an IFRS basis, consistent with the primary financial statements.
At 31 December 2007 the market value of the Groups external debt, subordinated debt, preference shares including General Accident plc preference shares of 250 million classified as minority interests and direct capital instrument was 5,774 million 2006: 5,991 million.

Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Sensitivity analysis Economic assumptions The following tables show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2007 and the new business contribution before the effect of required capital for 2007 to: one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rates: one percentage point increase and decrease in interest rates, including all consequential changes including assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : one percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed investment returns for equity and property investments, excluding any consequential changes to the risk discount rate: 10% rise and fall in market value of equity and property assets not applicable for new business contribution : and decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum or equivalent not applicable for new business contribution.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reflect sensitivity changes to future investment returns.
Some of the sensitivity scenarios may have consequential effects on valuation bases, where the basis for certain blocks of business is actively updated to reflect current economic circumstances.
Consequential valuation impacts on the sensitivities are allowed for where an active valuation basis is used.
Where businesses have a target asset mix, the portfolio is re-balanced after a significant market movement otherwise no re-balancing is assumed.

In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held.
The interest rate sensitivity will vary significantly by territory, depending on the type of business written: for example, where non-profit business is well matched by backing assets, the favourable impact of reducing the risk discount rate is the dominant factor.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued Sensitivity analysis continued Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.
This can be seen in the sensitivity of a 1% movement in the interest rate for the Netherlands, where there is a significant amount of business with investment return guarantees.
Sensitivities to a 1% movement in the equity property return will only impact the value of the in-force covered business, whereas a 10% movement in equity property values may impact both the net worth and the value of in-force, depending on the allocation of assets.

Where there is a look through into service company expenses, the fee charged by the service company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases: 10% decrease in lapse rates a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% pa would represent a lapse rate of 4.5% pa : 5% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates disclosed separately for life assurance and annuity business.
No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions.
In each sensitivity calculation all other assumptions remain unchanged.
No changes to valuation bases have been included.
