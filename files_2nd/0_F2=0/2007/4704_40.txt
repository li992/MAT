22 Financial instruments and risk management Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and policies are disclosed in the Business review see Risk management.
i Currency risk management The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, the groups policy, where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, was to hedge currency exposure on its net foreign operations before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages: 90% US dollars, 90% euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net foreign operations before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
The effective portion of exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency swaps and forwards is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement in accordance with IAS 39.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all net investment hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
Transaction exposure hedging For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is effective and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 109 Hedge of foreign currency debt The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated bonds.
As a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is highly effective and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
At 30 June 2007, as a result of the net investment, transaction exposure and foreign currency debt cover outlined above, the group had outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts as disclosed in note 22 vi.
Further quantitative analysis of the sensitivity to movements in currency rates is reported in the Market risk sensitivity analysis in the Business review.
ii Commodity price risk The group uses commodity futures to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity futures contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value.
To the extent that they are considered an effective hedge under IAS 39, the fair value movements are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Realised net gains recognised in the income statement in the year ended 30 June 2007 were 2 million.
Unrealised net gains on the balance sheet at 30 June 2007 were 1 million.
iii Interest rate risk management The group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing fixed and floating term debt, commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the groups reported financial performance.
During the year ended 30 June 2007 the profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings was maintained according to a duration measure that was approximately equivalent to a 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
The duration measure and the number of years within the amortising profile depend on the template approved by the board, which indicated, as at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006, that a higher proportion than 50% of fixed rate net borrowings was appropriate for the group.

The split of fixed and floating net borrowings above is after taking into account interest rate protection.
The average net borrowings for the year were 4,596 million 2006 4,017 million and the effective interest rate was 5.5% 2006 4.8%.
At 30 June 2007, after taking account of interest rate derivative instruments, the average fixed rates for US dollar, euro and sterling borrowings were 5.4%, 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively 2006 5.2%, 4.0% and nil, respectively.
At 30 June 2007, the currency split of cash and cash equivalents was: US dollar 23%, sterling 15%, euro 13% and other 49% 2006 21%, 20%, 12% and 47%, respectively.

Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the above short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges and related sale and lease back provisions.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profits, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.

b Derivative financial instruments not designated in hedging relationships.
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the asking price.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivatives, financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated using appropriate yield curves at 30 June each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.
Fair value hedging relationships Certain borrowings due within and after one year are part of qualifying fair value interest rate hedging relationships.
Accordingly there is a fair value adjustment for these liabilities with respect to the hedged interest rate risk, with changes being recognised in the income statement, as disclosed in note 22 vi.
Diageo has not designated any non-derivative financial assets or liabilities at fair value through the income statement upon initial recognition.
vi Hedging instruments Diageo designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either: a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge : b a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates cash flow hedge : or c a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
The accounting treatment for hedges is disclosed in Accounting policies of the group.
Diageo tests effectiveness on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis, hypothetical derivative method and volatility reduction.
All fair value hedges were effective during the year.
The gain on hedging instruments for the year was 20 million 2006 117 million loss and the loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks was 17 million 2006 114 million gain, resulting in a net loss of 25 million 2006 4 million net loss recognised in interest expense and finance charges and a net gain of 28 million 2006 1 million in interest income and finance income for the year.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, all cash flow hedges were effective and gains of 28 million 2006 39 million gains have been recognised in equity as the changes in fair value.
A loss of 43 million and a gain of 8 million have been transferred out of equity to other operating expenses and to other finance income, respectively, in the year 2006 11 million loss and 7 million gain, respectively.
With respect to hedges of forecast transactions and the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates, balances related to cash flow hedged items at 30 June 2007 will affect the income statement in 2008 and 2009 by 59 million and 10 million, respectively.
With respect to hedges of the cash flow risk from a change in forward foreign exchange rates using cross currency interest rate swaps, the retranslation of the related bond principal to closing foreign exchange rates and recognition of interest on the related bonds will affect the income statement at each period end date until the related bonds mature in 2016 and 2036.
Foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the hedged bonds taken to the income statement is expected to offset against the foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the cross currency swaps in each of the years.
