The Group has provided an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the Convertible Bonds 'Bonds' issued during the year by Dana Petroleum Jersey Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, the details of which are contained in note 21.

Capital Structure The Groups management remains committed to delivering and enhancing shareholder value, and building upon the progress made during recent years.
The Board continues to believe that this can best be achieved by investing in the existing asset portfolio and through the acquisition of new commercial opportunities as they arise, rather than to provide shareholder return through dividends.
This is, however, reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group seeks to optimise the return on investment, by managing the capital structure to achieve capital efficiency via the appropriate level of access to the debt markets at attractive cost levels.
Notes 20 and 21 to the financial statements provide further details of the financing activity in 2007.
