The fair value of scheme assets includes no amounts relating to any of the Groups own financial instruments or any of the property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.
The investment strategy is determined by each plans fiduciary body in consultation with the Group.
In general, the investment strategy for each plan is set by reference to the duration and risk profile of the plan, as well as the plans solvency level.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the long-term target asset allocation as at the reporting date.
For bonds, the expected rate of return reflects the redemption yields available on corporate and government bonds, as applicable, as at the reporting date.
For all other asset classes, the expected rate of return reflects the rate of return expected over the long term.
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages for defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: Australia Americas Europe South Africa Total %%%%% Year ended 30 June 2007 Discount rate 6.3 6.2 5.6 8.5 6.4 Future salary increases 4.9 4.3 4.7 6.8 4.9 Future pension increases 2.8 2.6 5.5 3.3 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 6.2 6.9 6.8 8.4 7.0 Year ended 30 June 2006 Discount rate 4.9 6.3 5.1 8.5 5.9 Future salary increases 4.1 4.4 4.5 6.8 4.7 Future pension increases 2.9 2.5 5.5 3.3 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 6.2 7.0 6.2 8.5 6.9 The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages for post-retirement medical schemes are as follows: Americas South Africa Total %%% Year ended 30 June 2007 Discount rate 6.2 8.8 7.4 Medical cost trend rate ultimate 5.0 7.3 6.1 Year ended 30 June 2006 Discount rate 6.2 8.5 7.3 Medical cost trend rate ultimate 5.0 6.8 5.8 Assumptions regarding future mortality can be material depending upon the size and nature of the plan liabilities.
Post-retirement mortality assumptions in the Americas, Europe and South Africa are considered significant.
The primary post-retirement mortality tables used in these regions are: i Americas: RP-2000 with adjustments for blue white collar workers, UP94 adjusted to allow for future mortality improvements: ii Europe: PMA 92 and PFA 92, GBV and GBM 2000-2005, each adjusted to allow for future mortality improvements: iii South Africa: PA 90 Ultimate rated down one year.
All mortality tables being used are standard tables for their respective region.

b Non-Australian plans are not required to report under AAS 25 Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans.
Accrued liabilities and asset values for other plans have generally been taken from IAS 19 AASB 119 disclosures as at 30 June 2007 refer above.
In the most recent actuarial review of the BHP Billiton Superannuation Fund, the plans actuary recommended that the BHP Billiton Group make contributions to the plan.
These were determined using an assumed contribution rate of 17.7 per cent of salaries increasing to 20.5 per cent no later than from 1 July 2008, a projected unit credit method of funding and on the basis that the cost of benefits is expected to be met each year as accrued.
The economic assumptions used in making these contribution recommendations include expected return on assets of 6.0 per cent and a salary increase rate of 4.3 per cent.
