Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 1 General information The Severn Trent group has a number of operations.
These are described in the segmental analysis in note 5.
Severn Trent Plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is shown on the back of the cover of the annual report and accounts.
Severn Trent Plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Accounting Standards IAS and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective and ratified by the European Union as at 31 March 2007 and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The comparative figures for the income statement have been restated to reclassify Biffa Plc and US Laboratories as discontinued operations following their demerger and disposal respectively.
b Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the results of Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since that date.
Losses attributable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the group has the power to control a subsidiary.
The results of joint venture undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis where the company exercised joint control under a contractual arrangement.
The results of associates are accounted for on an equity basis where the company holding is 20% or more or the company has the power to exercise significant influence.
All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and inter company sales, in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is not recognised until the service has been provided to the customer, or the goods to which the sale relates have either been despatched to the customer or, where they are held on the customers behalf, title has passed to the customer.
In respect of long term contracts, revenue is recognised based on the value of work carried out during the year with reference to the total sales value and the stage of completion of these contracts.
Turnover includes an estimate of the amount of mains water and wastewater charges unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon a measure of unbilled water consumed by tariff, which is calculated from historical billing information.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Interest and dividend income are included in finance income.
d Segmental reporting Each of the groups business and geographical segments provide services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other business segments.
Severn Trent 49 Notes to the group financial statements continued e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprises: i Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets are included at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation.
The costs of day to day servicing of infrastructure components are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Where it is probable that the money spent will cause future economic benefits to flow to the group, then costs are capitalised.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives, which are as follows: Years Impounding reservoirs 250 Raw water aqueducts 250 Mains 80-150 Sewers 150-200 ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included within land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of landfill sites includes the cost of acquiring, developing and engineering sites, but does not include interest.
The cost of the asset is depreciated over the estimated life of the site on the basis of the usage of void space.
Following the demerger of Biffa Plc the group no longer holds landfill sites.
iii Other assets Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated economic lives to their residual value, which are principally as follows: Years Buildings 30-80 Fixed plant and equipment 2-40 Vehicles and mobile plant 2-15 Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
Interest costs of debt raised to finance new property, plant and equipment are not included within the cost of those fixed assets, but are expensed to the income statement as they arise.
f Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments is capitalised as an asset with a corresponding liability representing the obligation to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a finance charge, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor and the finance charge being written off to the income statement at a constant rate over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period.
Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor, these are classified as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Leases of land are normally treated as operating leases, unless ownership is transferred at the end of the lease.
g Grants and contributions Grants and contributions received in respect of non-current assets, including charges made for new connections to the water and sewerage networks, are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the useful economic life of those assets.
Grants and contributions which are given in compensation for expenses incurred with no future related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period that they become receivable.
h Impairment of non current assets If the recoverable amount of goodwill, an item of property, plant and equipment, or any other non current asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or estimated value in use at the date the impairment review is undertaken.
Fair value less costs to sell represents the amount obtainable from the sale of the assets in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing third parties, less costs of disposal.
Value in use represents the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the cost of capital of the cash generating unit or asset.
The discount rate used is based on the groups cost of capital adjusted for the risk profiles of individual businesses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Impairment reviews are also carried out if there is some indication that an impairment may have occurred, or, where otherwise required, to ensure that non current assets are not carried above their estimated recoverable amounts.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement.
50 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Group financial statements i Investments After initial recognition at cost being the fair value of the consideration paid, investments which are classified as held for trading or available for sale are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognised in income or equity respectively.
When an available for sale investment is disposed of, or impaired, the gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement.
Other investments are classified as held to maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Investments held for an undefined period are excluded from this classification.
Such investments and those held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with any gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
j Inventory Inventory and work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and attributable overheads.
Development land and properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites.
The net realisable value of development land is based upon its value as a serviced site, after taking account of the cost of providing infrastructure services.
Following the disposal of Severn Trent Property the group no longer holds development land or properties.
k Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Such investments are normally those with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition and include cash and balances at central banks, treasury bills and other eligible bills, loans and certificates of deposit.
Cash and cash equivalents also include overdrafts repayable on demand.
l Provisions Provisions are made where there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.
The groups policy on provisions for specific areas is as follows: Landfill restoration costs: Provision for the cost of restoring landfill sites is made over the operational life of each landfill site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space.
Following the demerger of Biffa Plc the group no longer holds provisions for landfill costs.
Environmental control and aftercare costs: Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred over the operational life of each landfill site and may be incurred for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space.
Material environmental control and aftercare costs are discounted by applying an appropriate discount rate.
Insurance: Provision is made for claims notified and for claims incurred but which have not yet been notified, based on advice from the groups independent insurance advisers.
m Pension costs The group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured using bid price.
Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the groups defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is included in operating costs.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in other finance income or cost.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to pension plans are charged or credited to equity and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Costs of defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
n Foreign currency The results of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into the presentational currency of the group, sterling, using average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
The net investments in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Exchange differences thus arising are treated as movements in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity since 1 April 2004 relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement under the transitional rule of IFRS 1.
Exchange differences arising in respect of foreign exchange instruments taken out as hedges of overseas investments are also treated as movements in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective see note 20.
All other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the company and its subsidiary undertakings are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the income statement.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
All profits and losses on exchange arising during the year are dealt with through the income statement.
Severn Trent 51 Notes to the group financial statements continued o Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when it is incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised and written off over its expected useful economic life where the following criteria are met: An asset is created that can be identified: It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on property, plant and equipment relating to research and development projects is capitalised and written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
p Taxation The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expenses that are taxable in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on taxable temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise it.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non discounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
q Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets, whilst goodwill arising on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill this is credited directly to the income statement.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition, if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves under UK GAAP and remains eliminated against reserves.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is treated as an intangible fixed asset.
Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy set out above and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit that derives benefit from the goodwill for impairment testing purposes.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of that operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
r Intangible non current assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the historical cost model is applied to intangible assets.
Amortisation charged on assets with finite lives is taken to the income statement through operating expenses.
Finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Years Software 3-10 Other assets 2-20 Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
s Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at fair value on initial recognition and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method unless there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, where it is written down to is recoverable amount and the irrecoverable amount is recognised as an expense.
t Financial instruments i Debt instruments All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the net fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Where a loan or borrowing is in a fair value hedging relationship it is remeasured for changes in fair value of the hedged risk at the balance sheet date, with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement see below.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
ii Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency swaps, forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
52 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Group financial statements In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is taken to the income statement where the effective portion of the hedge will offset the gain or loss on the hedged item see above.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
Forward currency contracts and foreign currency borrowings are used to hedge net investments in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent that they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against changes in value of the related assets.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that date any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to the income statement if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value, with gains and losses reported in the income statement.
u Share based payments The group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of employee services is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted calculated using an appropriate pricing model, excluding the impact of any non market vesting conditions.
The number of awards that are expected to vest takes into account non market vesting conditions including, where appropriate, continuing employment by the group.
The charge is adjusted to reflect shares that do not vest as a result of failing to meet a non market condition.
v Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred except where it is probable that the contract will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is written off to the income statement over the life of the contract.
w Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Where an asset or group of assets a disposal group is available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable and expected to occur within one year, then the disposal group is deemed as held for sale.
The disposal group is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Where a group of assets, which comprises operations that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the group a component, has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale then the component is classified as a discontinued operation.
Non current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Depreciation is not charged on such assets.
x Purchase of own shares The group balance sheet incorporates the shares held by the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust the Trust and which have not vested unconditionally by the balance sheet date.
These are shown as a deduction from shareholders funds until such time as they vest.
y Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
z Exceptional items Exceptional items are income or expenditure, which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate should, in the opinion of the directors, be disclosed by virtue of their size or nature if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Severn Trent 53 Notes to the group financial statements continued 3 New accounting policies and future requirements The following statements have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and are likely to affect future financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standard 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures IFRS 7 was issued in August 2005 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2007.
The standard incorporates the disclosure requirements of IAS 32, which it supersedes and adds further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in relation to financial instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standard 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2009.
The standard requires identification of operating segments based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance.
The impact of the standard on Severn Trents financial statements is not expected to be significant since the groups segmental reporting already closely reflects reports regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive and the board.
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions was issued in November 2006.
The interpretation addresses accounting for share based payments in the separate financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries.
As such it is not applicable to the consolidated financial statements of Severn Trent Plc.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2008.
The interpretation draws a distinction between two types of services concession arrangement: those where the operator receives a financial asset, specifically an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from a government body in return for constructing or upgrading a public sector asset: and those where the operator receives an intangible asset, the right to charge for the use of the public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades.
The interpretation will be applicable to the groups contracts with the UK Ministry of Defence MoD and is expected to result in the recognition of both a financial asset in respect of the right to receive cash in return for upgrading the MoD assets and an intangible asset arising from the right to provide water and sewerage services.
IAS 23 revised was issued in March 2007 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2009.
The revision to the standard removes the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
Such costs are therefore required to be capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The revised standard will require Severn Trent to change its existing policy and is likely to result in a proportion of borrowing costs that are currently expensed being capitalised in property plant and equipment or intangible assets.
The costs will then be amortised over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets.
The directors assess that the other standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective are not applicable to the group.
4 Significant accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, the group is required to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available.
The more significant judgments and key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are summarised below: a Goodwill impairment Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 15 to the financial statements.
b Depreciation and carrying amounts of property plant and equipment Calculating the depreciation charge and hence the carrying value for property, plant and equipment requires estimates to be made of the useful lives of the assets.
The estimates are based on engineering data and the groups experience of similar assets.
Details are set out in note 2 e. c Retirement benefit obligations Determining the amount of the groups retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires assumptions to be made concerning long term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and longevity of current and future pensioners.
Changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of providing such benefits.
The group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Details of the assumptions made are set out in note 28 to the financial statements.
d Tax provisions Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgments to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and enquiries from tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions.
The assessments made are based on advice from independent tax advisers and the status of ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
54 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Group financial statements 5 Segmental analysis The group is organised into two main business segments: Water and Sewerage Provides water and sewerage services to domestic and commercial customers in England and Wales.
Water Technologies and Services Provides services and products associated with water, waste water and contaminated land principally in the US, UK and Europe.
Corporate and Other Following the sale of Severn Trent Property and other property interests, the sole remaining other business is the groups corporate insurance company.
Henceforth this is reported together with unallocated corporate costs as Corporate and Other in the segmental analysis.
All prior year numbers have been restated for comparative purposes.
The group is also organised into geographical regions, UK, US and Europe.
Geographical information is classified by the location of the principal operations of each business unit.

Segment assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventories, derivatives designated as hedges for future transactions, receivables and operating cash.
Deferred taxation, investments and derivatives designated as hedges of borrowings are all included in unallocated corporate assets.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities.
Taxation and corporate borrowings and related hedging derivatives are all included in unallocated corporate liabilities.
Severn Trent 57 Notes to the group financial statements continued The entire Waste Management segment has been divested and its results are included in discontinued operations in 2006 07.
The comparative figures have been restated to reflect the current year classification.

62 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Group financial statements 14 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The weighted average number of shares for the year ended 31 March 2006 has been restated to reflect the 2 for 3 share consolidation that was approved at the extraordinary general meeting on 6 October 2006.

The fixed interest rates vary from 4.38% to 6.45%.
The main floating rate is LIBOR.
Included within this are interest rate swaps with a notional value of 1,432 million 2006: 850 million which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The group has an ongoing debt requirement and these swaps aim to fix the interest rates paid on a portfolio of variable debt of various terms.
As it is not possible to specifically match these swaps to individual debt instruments, they do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amounts of the outstanding cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2007 was 491.3 million 2006: 467.6 million.
These swap a variety of currencies into sterling.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities During the year the group held a US dollar cross currency swap that was designated as a hedge of net investment in the groups US subsidiaries.
The swap matured in January 2007 and was not replaced.
The foreign exchange gain of 6.4 million 2006: loss of 5.3 million was recognised in hedging reserves in shareholders equity.

When market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
h Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of surplus funds.
i Market risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
In addition, the group has a significant value of foreign currency debt, primarily in US dollars, yen and euros.
Foreign exchange risk arises when transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency debt the group enters into cross currency swaps with external parties.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated at group level and company level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The groups risk management policy is to hedge 100% of all foreign currency denominated debt.
The group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the groups foreign operations is managed through borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
ii Credit risk Operationally, the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to continue to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
For financing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
iii Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
iv Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain over 50% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments.
At 31 March 2007 some 69% of the groups net debt was fixed.
72 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Group financial statements The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals mainly semi annually, the difference between fixed contract and floating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to fix floating rate debt within the group, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a credit of 52.7 million 2006: charge of 31.5 million in the income statement.
i Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as trading and available for sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over the counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Estimated discounted cash flows are used to determine fair value for the debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the group for similar financial instruments.
21 Available for sale financial assets 2007 2006 m m Investments in unquoted equity instruments 0.2 0.5 The fair values of the unquoted equity instruments cannot be measured reliably since there is no active market in the instruments.
Hence the investments are held at cost.
It is not possible to determine a range of estimates within which the fair values are highly likely to lie.

The weighted average effective rate payable on fixed rate leases was 4.3% in 2006.
The lease obligations are secured against the related assets.
The fair value of the finance lease obligations is not significantly different from their carrying value.
There were no contingent rents, escalation clauses or material renewal or purchase options.
The terms of the finance leases do not impose restrictions on dividend payments, additional debt or further leasing.

No asset has been recognised for these losses since it is not probable that there will be sufficient taxable profit available against which the losses can be utilised.
The Chancellors budget announced proposed changes to the future rate of corporation tax and industrial buildings allowances that, if enacted in the Finance Act, will impact the deferred tax pension and future tax charges.
The group is currently assessing the likely impact of these changes.
76 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Group financial statements 28 Retirement benefit schemes Defined benefit schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The defined benefit schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out at regular intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the defined benefit schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated as a proportion varying between one thirtieth and one eightieth for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.
The final salary sections of all of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age profile of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
The UK defined benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK defined benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension Scheme STPS 31 March 2004 Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme SSPS 31 March 2004 Severn Trent Water Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2006 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes.
On the demerger of Biffa Plc the company entered into an agreement with that company and the trustees of the STPS, the SSPS and the UK Waste Pension Scheme UKWPS whereby the assets and liabilities relating to Biffa Plc employees in the STPS and the SSPS would be transferred to the UKWPS with effect from 31 March 2007.
The group has no continuing responsibility for the UKWPS following this agreement.
The net deficit relating to Biffa Plc employees at the demerger date was 39 million.
This has been included in the net assets that formed the dividend in specie on demerger.
The reduction in the deficit between the demerger date and 31 March 2007 has been treated as an exceptional loss on settlement of 7.8 million.
The group has an obligation to pay pension to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benefits amounting to 7.5 million 2006: 11.5 million is included in the retirement benefit obligation.
The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2007 2006 Price inflation 3.0% 2.7% Salary increases 4.5% 4.2% Pension increases in payment and deferment 3.0% 2.7% Discount rate 5.4% 4.9% Longevity at age 65 for pensioners retiring now men years 19.2 18.3 women years 22.1 21.0 Longevity at age 65 for pensioners retiring in 20 years men years 19.9 18.9 women years 23.0 21.8 Severn Trent 77 Notes to the group financial statements continued Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Amounts charged to operating costs Current service cost 41.1 38.9 Past service cost 0.4 0.8 Exceptional settlement 7.8 49.3 39.7 Amounts charged to net finance costs Interest cost 73.0 75.4 Expected return on scheme assets 87.0 79.2 14.0 3.8 Total amount charged to the income statement 35.3 35.9 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.

Severn Trent 85 Notes to the group financial statements continued 37 Contingent liabilities a Bonds and guarantees Group undertakings have entered into bonds in the normal course of business.
No liability is expected to arise in respect of either bonds or guarantees.
b Regulatory matters In May 2004 an employee of Severn Trent Water raised a number of allegations relating, in particular, to alleged accounting inaccuracies and regulatory returns.
On 31 October 2005, as a result of a referral by Ofwat, the Serious Fraud Office SFO informed the company that it was undertaking a criminal investigation into alleged reporting irregularities made to Ofwat by Severn Trent Water Limited between 2000 and 2003.
Ofwat had been conducting its own investigation following the allegations made by the employee of Severn Trent Water.
Ofwat began its investigation into the allegations in January 2005.
The matter reported to the SFO concerned data on leakage.
On 7 March 2006 Ofwat published its interim report concerning the allegations of false reporting made against Severn Trent Water in 2004.
In responding to the report Severn Trent Plc agreed to credit customers accounts and reduce future tariffs.
The company also acknowledged that Ofwat may expect further amends to be made to customers.
Ofwat has stated that this penalty will be discussed with Severn Trent Water on completion of the SFO investigation into leakage.
In April 2006 the company announced that the board believed there was prima facia evidence of customer relations data being misstated by Severn Trent Water in submissions to Ofwat.
We are working and fully cooperating with Ofwat and Ernst & Young LLP on their investigations into this.
In June 2006 Ofwat issued a notice under section 22A of the water Industry Act stating its intention to fine Severn Trent Water for failure to meet customer service standards.
No reliable estimate can currently be made of the amounts that might become payable as a result of the SFO enquiry, Ofwats final conclusion in respect of the allegations of false reporting or its review of customer relations data.
Consequently, except as noted above, no provision has been included in these financial statements in respect of these matters.
c Disposal of subsidiaries The group has given certain guarantees and indemnities in relation to disposals of businesses.
In June 2005 the Flemish Waste Agency OVAM instigated an investigation by the Antwerp Examining Magistrate into Biffa Belgiums waste recycling operations in connection with the payment of environmental taxes.
Although two of the Biffa Belgium companies were indicted by the Flemish prosecuting authorities on 13 December 2005, the proceedings against these companies have not progressed any further since that date.
Separately, the Nivelles Public Prosecutor issued a claim on 22 November 2006 against Biffa Belgium that may relate to the same matters investigated in the Flanders region.
No provision has been made for any criminal penalties that might result from this investigation since no reliable estimate can be made of the amount that might become payable.
Pursuant to the sale agreement of 11 May 2006, the group has given an indemnity in relation to certain costs that may be suffered by the former Biffa Belgium businesses as a result of these proceedings.
A provision of 1.5 million has been made in these financial statements for liabilities that that may result from this indemnity.
A provision of 1.5 million has been made in these financial statements for liabilities that may result from this indemnity.
On 5 March 2007 the group received notice of a claim for 23.4 million from Veolia Proprete S. A. alleging breach of warranty in relation to the disposal of Biffa Belgium.
The group considers that there is no basis for this claim and hence no provision has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this matter.
The group is not aware of any other liability that is likely to result from these guarantees and indemnities that has not been provided for in these financial statements.
