Notes to the consolidated financial statements 15 Intangible assets continued The remaining goodwill relates to a number of smaller acquisitions, each of which has been tested for impairment using management projections for five years and pre-tax discount rates in the range of 10% to 13%.
c Adjustments to goodwill in the prior year included amounts arising under the realignment of the Sucralose business on 2 April 2004 the realignment.
Under the terms of the realignment, deferred consideration is payable to McNeil based on the achievement of certain minimum targets in respect of sales of Sucralose made by the Group see note 31.
Expected future payments were provided for at the time of the realignment and any changes to the Groups estimates of the deferred consideration are adjusted to goodwill.
On elimination of goodwill any reduction in the deferred payment provision due to lower expectations of future payments is recognised in the income statement.
Another feature of the realignment is that the Group receives amounts from the vendor, McNeil, based on sales of Sucralose tabletop products made by McNeil for ten years from the date of the realignment.
These receipts are treated as contingent assets, only recognised in the periods in which they are earned, and are shown as a deduction from goodwill.
On elimination of goodwill the receipts are also recognised in the income statement.
In the year ended 31 March 2007 6 million of receipts were recognised in the income statement 31 March 2006 3 million.
Goodwill relating to the realignment was eliminated in the year ended 31 March 2006.

a Impact of changes to the EU sugar regime As a result of the announced changes to the EU sugar regime, which were implemented in July 2006 and significantly reduce both EU sugar prices and EU subsidised exports of sugar, the Group carried out an impairment review of the assets in Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe and the EU sugars business in the year ended 31 March 2006.
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe is a major supplier of sweeteners which operates in competition to sugar throughout Europe.
In 2006, management concluded that, in light of the changes to the EU sugar regime, in certain markets the business would be unlikely to generate sufficient returns to cover its cost of capital.
As a result an impairment loss of 263 million was recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
In October 2006, the Group announced its intention to dispose of all or part of the Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe business, and on 9 May 2007 confirmed that it was in discussions that may lead to a sale of part of the business see note 38.
An impairment review has again been carried out by comparing the recoverable amount of the individual cash generating units with their net book value.
For the purposes of the review, recoverable amount for the part of the business identified for potential disposal was based on fair value less costs to sell.
For the remaining cash generating units recoverable amount was based on value in use, calculated based on estimated future cash flows using management internal forecasts of future margins excluding the impact of any major initiatives for the next five years.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 12% 2006 11% and zero growth was assumed in perpetuity due to the regulated nature of the market.
Taking all factors into account management have concluded that no further impairment or reversal of the impairment booked in the year ended 31 March 2006 is required.
The UK and Portuguese Sugars businesses are also impacted by the proposed changes to the EU sugar regime.
Managements impairment review of these businesses, which was based on internal forecasts of future cash flows for the next five years and discounted at 12%, did not result in an impairment in either the year ended 31 March 2006 or 31 March 2007.
Management forecasts included a key assumption that Transitional Aid, to which both businesses are entitled under the terms of the regime, will be received in line with expectations.
b Other impairment reviews In March 2007 the Group announced that, as a consequence of intense competition from Chinese imports and oversupply in the world market, it would cease production of citric acid at the Selby, UK, site.
In addition, due to continuing losses in the astaxanthin product line, which is manufactured on the same site, a fundamental review of this business has been carried out.
Consequently property, plant and equipment at Selby, UK, has been written off in the year to its recoverable amount.
In the prior year an impairment review of the citric acid business was carried out, which resulted in an impairment of 9 million.
Leased assets Included in property, plant and equipment is plant and machinery held under finance leases with a net book value of 22 million 2006 9 million.
During the year ended 31 March 2007 14 million of additions were recognised on the inception of finance leases 2006 5 million.
Capitalised borrowing costs The aggregate amount of borrowing costs included in the cost of property, plant and equipment is 46 million 2006 44 million, of which 7 million 2006 4 million was capitalised during the year.
