The address of the registered ofce is given on the inside back cover.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1.
1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union EU, including International Accounting Standards IAS and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
Practice is continuing to evolve on the application and interpretation of IFRS.
Further standards may be issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and standards currently in issue and endorsed by the EU may be subject to Interpretations issued by the IFRIC.
IFRS, as adopted by the EU, differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of PZ Cussons Plc and entities controlled by PZ Cussons Plc its subsidiaries made up to 31st May each year.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
The total profits or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement and the interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, the accounts of the overseas subsidiaries are adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Operating profit Operating profit is the profit of the Group before finance income, finance costs and taxation.
Financial Statements | Annual Report 2007 | 45 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items The Group has adopted a columnar income statement format which seeks to highlight significant items within the Group results for the period.
Such items are considered by the directors to be exceptional in nature rather than being representative of the underlying trading of the Group, and may include such items as restructuring costs, material impairments of non-current assets, material profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment and profit or loss on disposal or termination of operations.
The directors apply judgement in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature should be disclosed in the middle column of the income statement and notes to the financial statements as Exceptional items.
The directors believe that the separate disclosure of these items is relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classied as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at the lower of the assets previous carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting, rather than proportional consolidation.
Under IAS 28 Investments in associates and IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures, a single gure for results is presented as a separate item on the face of the income statement as part of profit before tax within operating profit, while a single gure is disclosed for the Group share of net assets within xed asset investments.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets An acquired brand is only recognised on the balance sheet where it is supported by a registered trademark, where brand earnings are separately identiable and the brand could be sold separately from the rest of the business.
Brands acquired as part of a business combination are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Purchased brands are recorded at purchase cost.
Brands currently held are not amortised as the directors believe they have indefinite lives.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, the brands are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as income.
46 | Annual Report 2007 | Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classication.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of the assets previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates and sales related taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Sales of goods are recognised when title has passed and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the actual rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly.
Cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising on the translation and consolidation of foreign operations income statements and balance sheets denominated in foreign currencies are recorded as a separate component of equity.
Applying the exemption under IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has set the currency reserve to zero at 1st June 2004, the date of transition to IFRS and measured and recorded separately in that currency reserve all cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising after that date.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences will be transferred to the income statement in the period of the disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants Government grants related to property, plant and equipment are reected in the balance sheet as deferred income and credited to the income statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
Grants previously recognised are subject to fullment of ongoing conditions.
Financial Statements | Annual Report 2007 | 47 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Employee benets Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates retirement benefit schemes in the United Kingdom and for most overseas countries in which it carries on business.
Those in the United Kingdom are dened benefit schemes: overseas schemes vary in detail depending on local practice.
In respect of the dened benefit schemes, the cost of providing benets is determined using the projected unit credit method, with full actuarial valuations being carried out every three years or more frequently should a material change occur in any of the schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets are already vested, and otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group operates a deferred annual share bonus scheme and an executive share option scheme for senior executives, both of which involve equity-settled share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 Share-based payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7th November 2002 that were unvested as of 1st June 2007.
Equity-settled share-based payments under the executive share option scheme are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The cost to the company of making awards under the deferred annual share bonus scheme is charged to the income statement over the period to which the performance relates.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a net basis.
48 | Annual Report 2007 | Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administration purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All other assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: Freehold buildings at rates not less than 2% Leasehold buildings at rates which will reduce the book value to nil on or before the termination of the leases with a minimum of 2% Plant and machinery not less than 8% Fixtures, ttings and vehicles not less than 20% In the case of major projects depreciation is provided from the date the project in question is brought into use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss for the period.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank and in hand plus short-term deposits less overdrafts.
Short-term deposits have a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency uctuations relating to certain rm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The occasional use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis through the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial Statements | Annual Report 2007 | 49 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Investments Investments other than interests in joint ventures are recognised and derecognised on a trade date when a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classied as either held-to-maturity, held-for-trading, loans and receivables or available-for-sale.
Held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Held-for-trading and available-for-sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held-for-trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and accounting judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by denition, differ from the actual results.
The assumptions and estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Accounting for intangible assets The Group records all acquired intangible assets at fair value.
Intangible assets are not amortised but are subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the intangible asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of key estimates are discussed in note 10.
Retirement benets The Group operates three main UK retirement benefit schemes, which are independent of the Groups nances.
Actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The retirement benefit cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with the advice of a rm of actuaries based on the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary.
The assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary by the company, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management.
The assumptions are disclosed in note 23.
Operating results are affected by the actuarial assumptions used.
These assumptions include discount rates, mortality rates, ination rates and expected long-term rates of return on assets and may differ from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions and longer or shorter lives of participants.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery, which represents the point at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, and when collection of the resulting consideration for those goods is reasonably assured.
Should management consider that the criteria for recognition are not met, revenue is deferred until such time as the consideration has been fully earned.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable net of discounts, rebates and sales-related taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

The preference shares, which had a nominal value of 7.9 million, were fully repaid on 1st August 2005.
At 31st May 2007, the Paterson Zochonis Employee Trust held 3,913,299 ordinary shares 2006: 4,972,990 ordinary shares.
The trust waived any entitlement to the dividends on these shares.
The comparative gures have been restated for the share split, on the basis of ten for one, which was approved at the last annual general meeting on 25th September 2006, such that there are now ten 1p ordinary shares for every 10p ordinary share previously in existence before the share split.

Goodwill and intangible assets, which have indefinite useful lives, are subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations that use amounts from approved budgets and plans over a period of 5 years 2006: 5 years and cash ows projected forward assuming no growth in year 6 onwards.
The discount rate applied to the cashow projections was 8.5% 2006: 8.5%.
The average growth rate applied to the initial five year period of 10% 2006: 11% was based on industry growth rates.
Intangible assets and goodwill are allocated to the appropriate CGU identied, which is directly driven by the brand of product.

Included in the assets above are 2.6 million 2006: 1.3 million of assets which have been categorised as non-current assets held for sale.
The directors expectation is that the assets, which are included in the European segment, and which predominantly relate to manufacturing sites in the UK, will be sold within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The assets were being actively marketed at 31st May 2007.
There was no adjustment to the carrying value of these assets on categorisation as held for sale.

The Group does not exercise significant inuence over the affairs of this company as it does not have the power to participate in the financial and operating policies of the entity, and it is therefore not treated as an associated company.

Trade receivables do not carry interest.
Allowances are estimated by management based on past default experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers in a number of different countries.
The average credit period taken on sales ranges from 17 to 91 days 2006: 16 to 84 days due to the differing nature of trade receivables in the Groups geographical segments.

Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The weighted average rate of interest on bank overdrafts was 12.9% 2006: 7.3%.
Bank overdrafts are at oating rates of interest and hence expose the Group to cashow interest rate risk.
At 31st May 2007, the Group had undrawn overdraft facilities of 60 million 2006: 93 million available to it.

Financial Statements | Annual Report 2007 | 61 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 18 Borrowings continued Financial instruments and risk management The primary financial risk faced by the Group is exchange rate risk.
The board has reviewed and agreed policies for management of this risk, as summarised below.
The board has also approved all of the classes of financial instruments that may be used by the Group.
The Groups treasury function, which is authorised to conduct the day-to-day treasury activities of the Group, reports at least annually to the board.
The occasional use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the board, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
All of the Groups activities involve analysis, acceptance and management of some degree of risk or combination of risks.
The most important types of financial risk are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Market risks include foreign exchange, interest rate and equity price risks.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and up-to-date systems.
The Group modies and enhances its risk management policies and systems to reect changes in markets and products.
The audit committee, under authority delegated by the board, formulates high level Group risk management policy, monitors risk and receives reports that allow it to review the effectiveness of the Groups risk management policies.
Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
It arises principally from lending, trade finance, treasury and leasing activities.
The Group has dedicated standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor all such risks.
Although the Group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating reviews of the counterparties and by limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party.
The Group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.
Liquidity management The Group maintains a strong liquidity position and manages the liquidity prole of its assets, liabilities and commitments so that cashows are appropriately balanced and all funding obligations are met when due.
Market risk management Market risk is the risk that movements in market rates, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity and commodity prices will reduce the Groups income or the value of its portfolios.
The management of market risk is undertaken using risk limits approved by the finance directors under delegated authority.
The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
However, subsidiary undertakings only occasionally make significant sales or purchases in currencies other than their functional currencies and hence on rare occasions the Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage these exposures.
The Group did not enter into any material derivative instruments during the year or the prior year and there were no open derivative instruments at 31st May 2007 or 31st May 2006.
Financial instruments utilised by the Group during the years ended 31st May 2007 and 31st May 2006, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: Current and non-current investments In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Groups balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
The carrying value of the Groups listed investments, which are classied as held-for-trading, is 0.3 million 2006: nil.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings and cash The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of long-term borrowings at 31st May 2007 is estimated to not be materially different to its carrying value.
The financial instruments held by the Group do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash ow interest rate risk.

Of the retirement benets provision 3.5 million 2006: nil is expected to be utilised in the next 12 months.
23 Retirement benets a Overview The Group operates retirement benefit schemes for most of its United Kingdom and overseas subsidiaries.
The following three dened benefit schemes are the Groups main schemes, which are based and administered in the UK: Main staff plan for all eligible UK based staff, excluding PZ Cussons Plc executive directors Directors plan for PZ Cussons Plc executive directors Expatriate plan for all eligible expatriate staff based outside the UK Employees within these schemes are provided with dened benets based on service and final salary.
The assets of the schemes are administered by trustees and are held in trust funds independent of the Group.
The Group also operates an unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit scheme.
The cost of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit scheme is included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 Employee benets and the assumptions set out below.
In accordance with these unfunded arrangements, the Group made no payments to former directors in the year ended 31st May 2007 2006: 0.2 million.
The last triennial actuarial valuations of the schemes administered in the UK were performed by independent professional actuaries at 1st June 2006 using the projected unit method of valuation.
The Groups balance sheet at 31st May 2007 reects a pension surplus of 23.1 million 2006: 23.4 million in respect of the Expatriate plan, and combined deficits in the Staff and Directors plans of 28.9 million 2006: 24.8 million and 8.3 million 2006: 5.7 million respectively.
For the year to 31st May 2007 the total dened benefit pension cost arising from the three schemes amounted to 2.9 million 2006: 3.4 million.
The major financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: 31st May 31st May 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.10% 3.70% Rate of increase in retirement benets in payment 3.10% 2.70% Discount rate 5.20% 5.10% Ination assumption 3.10% 2.70% 64 | Annual Report 2007 | Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Retirement benets continued The assets in the schemes and the expected rates of return were: 31st May 31st May 31st May 2007 2006 2005 m m m Equities 6.90% 130.0 6.70% 117.7 6.40% 97.2 Bonds 4.70% 90.8 4.50% 93.5 4.20% 90.4 Cash 5.00% 8.4 4.25% 3.8 4.00% 7.1 Total fair value of scheme assets 229.2 215.0 194.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 243.3 222.1 199.5 deficit in the schemes 14.1 7.1 4.8 Related deferred tax asset 4.2 2.1 1.5 Net retirement benefit deficit 9.9 5.0 3.3 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the company considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset class in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each class of asset.
The expected return for each class of asset was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on plan assets was 17.6 million 2006: 21.9 million.
The net retirement benefit expense before taxation recognised in the income statement in respect of the dened benefit schemes is summarised as follows: 31st May 31st May 2007 2006 m m Current service cost 4.4 4.8 Past service cost 0.2 0.5 Expected return on scheme assets 12.1 10.3 Interest cost 11.3 10.2 Curtailment gain 0.9 1.8 Net retirement benefit expense before taxation 2.9 3.4 All above amounts are recognised in the Groups income statement before arriving at operating profit.

29 Share-based payments The company operates a share option scheme for senior executives.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the companys shares on the dealing day before the option is granted.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group for any reason outside of the scheme rules.
Options under the scheme are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years from the date of grant and are subject to performance conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model according to the relevant measures of performance.
The model includes adjustments, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural considerations and expected dividend payments.
The option life is derived by the models based on these assumptions and other assumptions identied below.
The expected volatility has been estimated using company specic data, unlike the prior period where industry data was used.
The total expense included within operating profit in respect of share-based payments was 0.1 million 2006: 0.4 million.
For those share option awards that were granted in the years ended 31st May 2007 and 31st May 2006, the assumptions used in the calculation of the fair values were as follows: Year to Year to 31st May 31st May 2007 2006 Vesting period 3 yrs 3 yrs Expected volatility 12.0% 26.0% Expected option life after anticipated lapses 3 yrs 3 yrs Risk-free rate 3% 3% Expected dividend yield 2.68% 2.68% Fair value per share p 6.8 6.8 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 4 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The dividend yield for 2006 was used for 2007 as the dividend for 2007 had not been approved at the AGM at the time the accounts were published.
