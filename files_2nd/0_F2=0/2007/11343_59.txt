ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The following sets out the key assumptions concerning the future and key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year.
Insurance proceeds The accounts include a cumulative amount of 59.0m 2006: 34.6m recognised as compensation following the Buncefield explosion.
This is a provisional amount based on what is reliably measurable at 30 April 2007 for the recoverability of impaired assets and costs incurred to date.
At 30 April 2007, 40.0m 2006: 20.0m of insurance proceeds had been received.
The net balance of 19.0m 2006: 14.6m is shown in other receivables.
In the previous year, land and buildings at our head office next to Buncefield were impaired in full to reflect the reduction in market value following the incident.
A further insurance receipt of 13.8m 2006: 16.3m has been recognised for reinstating the building to the extent that it is reliably measurable under the Groups policy and is recognised as other operating income.
As part of this, land valued at 6.5m has been written down in the previous year to nil, with a revaluation upwards of 3.0m 2006: nil recorded in the current year.
