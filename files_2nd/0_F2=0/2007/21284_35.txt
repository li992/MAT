48 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Financial instruments i Management of risk The Groups financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares that are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives as set out on the inside cover of the report and accounts: Debenture stock, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations: Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups operations: and Derivative transactions which the Group enters into comprising traded options, the purpose of which is to manage market price risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
As last year, these policies have not changed throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and stock selection are other factors which act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through its debenture stocks and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and the Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Groups assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out overleaf.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of short term borrowing and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
The Board is aware that the Manager regularly reviews its counterparties for deposit takers.
The Company expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
The Company lends securities from its portfolio, within limits set by the Board.
It receives collateral to cover the securities lent.
This collateral is subject to concentration limits, to a margin and to regular revaluation.
Foreign currency risk The Groups total income and net assets can be significantly affected by currency translation movements as some of the Groups assets and revenue are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The Manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments.
Borrowings in foreign currencies will be limited to levels appropriate to the asset exposure to these currencies.
