Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 A Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Fair value as at 1 January 27,886 22,919 Additions 1,562 Disposals 670 Movement in fair value 3,420 4,075 At 31 December 24,466 27,886 ii At 31 December 2007, the Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in Great Britain.
These are General Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General Accident plc no longer carries out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2007 are listed on pages 268 and 269.
B Operating expenses i Operating expenses Operating expenses comprise: 2007 2006 m m Staff costs and other employee related expenditure see below 92 87 Other operating costs 95 71 Net foreign exchange losses 6 43 Total 193 201 ii Staff costs Total staff costs were: 2007 2006 m m Wages and salaries 46 53 Social security costs 6 6 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 6 6 Defined contribution schemes 2 2 Profit sharing and incentive plans 13 1 239 Equity compensation plans see iv below 17 17 Financial Termination benefits 2 2 statements Total 92 87 iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in note 46. iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in note 29.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors remuneration report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.

Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 70 million 2006: 68 million.
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2007 was 3,006 million 2006: 3,076 million.
The fair value of the 9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2007 was 249 million 2006: 275 million.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.
Further details of these borrowings can be found in note 47.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Company financial statements continued F Derivative financial instruments Non-hedge derivatives The Companys non-hedge derivative activity at 31 December 2007 was as follows: 2007 2006 Contract Contract notional Fair value Fair value notional Fair value Fair value amount asset liability amount asset liability m m m m m m Foreign exchange contracts OTC Forwards 73 2 Total 73 2 G Contingent liabilities Details of the Companys contingent liabilities are given in note 50 h. H Risk management policies Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in note 55.
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations.
Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the risk management policies are given in note 55.
Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting policy D. The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uses a three month rolling average of the Companys share price.
Given that the key input into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions.
Management believes the resulting estimated fair values recorded in the balance sheet and any changes in fair values recorded in the income statement are reasonable, and are the most appropriate values at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries.
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired.
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings details of which are provided in notes E and 47 and loans owed to subsidiaries.
Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations 242 in these rates.
The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments which are also exposed Financial to interest rate fluctuations held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each statements company's net exposure.
The majority of the Company's external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates.
However, for those borrowings that are at floating rates, the Company is affected by changes in these rates.
Further details of the Company's borrowings are provided in notes E and 47.
Currency risk The Companys direct subsidiaries are all incorporated and operating in the UK, and therefore are not exposed to currency risk.
However, these subsidiaries are themselves exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world.
The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in note 55.
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars.
However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds financial investments in these currencies, generating the net investment hedge described in note 56 c. Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 I Related party transactions The Company receives dividend and interest income from subsidiaries and pays interest and fee expense to those subsidiaries in the normal course of business.
