The Mitchells & Butlers group was created on its separation from Six Continents on 15 April 2003.
Significant changes were made to the financing structure of the Group which resulted in the replacement of inter-company balances owed to Six Continents with external debt.
In addition, the Mitchells & Butlers group no longer benefited from the Six Continents group tax arrangements that were in place prior to the separation.
The pro forma group income statement for 2003 therefore present the results on the basis that the post separation financing and taxation structure had been in place since 1 October 2002.
The pro forma income statement is also stated before exceptional items.
Adjusted earnings per share is stated after removing the impact of exceptional items, less tax thereon.
The adjustments required to make UK GAAP historic information consistent with that presented under IFRS relate to share-based payment charges and the different calculation basis of deferred tax under IFRS.
