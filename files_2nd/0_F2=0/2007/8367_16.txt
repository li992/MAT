The main reason for the increase in the tax rate was due to an increase in earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions.
60 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2007 8 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions and goodwill impairment.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders to have a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.

Each of these cash generating units has been tested for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy described on page 54.
Detailed results of the impairment tests for material acquisitions with goodwill in excess of 5% of total net book value of goodwill, are presented below.
Material acquisitions 2007 2006 m m Oil, Chemical & Agri Genalysis 21.2 Oil, Chemical & Agri Alta Analytical Laboratories 9.5 9.6 Oil, Chemical & Agri Quantitative Technologies 9.3 Oil, Chemical & Agri Umitek 9.1 Oil, Chemical & Agri Automotive Research 9.0 9.1 Commercial & Electrical National Software Testing Laboratories 8.9 Commercial & Electrical Entela 8.7 8.8 Others each less than 5% of total goodwill at 31 December 2007 72.7 43.6 Total goodwill net book value at 31 December 148.4 71.1 All goodwill is denominated in local currency and is translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Each of the acquisitions offers similar services to those already offered by the Intertek Groups existing businesses, therefore it is considered appropriate to use the same assumptions in each of the impairment calculations.
In each case the recoverable amount of the acquired business, determined upon a value-in-use calculation, was higher than its carrying amount except for those discussed below.
Management approved forecasts for each cash generating unit are used in these calculations.
These forecasts cover a two-year period and are based on the most current information relating to each business unit.
Beyond two years, management consider that it is difficult to accurately forecast business growth for each individual unit.
In Interteks business, most contractual relationships with customers are short-term.
Despite this, the Group has a strong historical track record of growth.
Intertek is supporting global trade which grows faster than GDP and our underlying markets are expected to continue to show good growth.
Therefore, when looking at longer term growth not exceeding five years, a steady conservative growth rate of 5% is used for all business units.
This is considered to be a reasonable assumption based on the long-term historical growth rate in profits of the Intertek businesses.
A Group pre-tax, risk adjusted, discount rate of 11% 2006: 12% has been used in the value-in-use calculations.
The characteristics of the businesses acquired are that they are not capital intensive and are largely similar to each other, and therefore the rate of 11%, which is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, is considered to be the most appropriate rate.
The key sensitivity for the impairment test is the growth in operating profit.
Had the overall growth rate been reduced by 1% to 4%, the carrying amount would still not have exceeded the recoverable amount.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate assumption would not change the conclusions of the impairment tests.
There are 45 2006: 36 cash generating units with a goodwill amount that is not significant in relation to the carrying value of goodwill of 148.4m 2006: 71.1m.
The aggregate balance of goodwill for these multiple cash generating units is 72.7m 2006: 43.6m.
The recoverable amount of all these units was determined following the same assumptions as for the individually significant units disclosed above.
An impairment charge of 0.4m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Commercial & Electrical division in respect of the goodwill of a certification business in India, which was acquired by the Group in 2005.
This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results in the period since acquisition.
The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using projected cash flows for this business, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 11%.
The charge of 0.4m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value.
The carrying amount after the impairment was 0.8m.
No other goodwill impairment losses were identified.
In 2006, an impairment charge of 0.3m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Oil, Chemical & Agri division, in respect of the goodwill of Eurolabo, a company registered in Estonia and acquired by the Group in 2005.
The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using projected cash flows for this company, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 12%.
The charge of 0.3m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value which, after the impairment, was 0.1m.
There are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.

There is a temporary difference of 10.2m 2006: 16.4m which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings.
No deferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from or sell the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.

In August 2007, an additional 100.0m tranche was added making a total facility of 400.0m.
The facility was originally for five years expiring on 15 December 2009, with two one-year extension options to extend this up to a further two years.
The facility was extended by a year in 2005 and by a further year in 2006.
The facility now expires in December 2011.
The facility comprises four tranches.
Facility A is a 28.0m multi-currency term loan original 70.0m less repayments to 31 December 2007 with bi-annual equal amortisations over the remaining two years.
Facility B is a 150.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, available up to 15 December 2011.
Facility C is a 364 day, 72.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, with the option to convert this into a one-year loan by the end of the 364 day period.
During the year, 8.0m of this facility was repaid.
This amount has been included in debt falling due between one and two years because the Group expects to be able to renew the facility for a further 364 day period.
Facility D is a 100.0m multi-currency term loan facility available up to 15 December 2011.
Advances under Facilities A and B bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus a margin.
The margin over LIBOR is in the range of 0.4% to 0.6% in accordance with a leverage grid.
As at 31 December 2007, the margin was 0.45%.
Advances under Facility C and D initially bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus a margin.
The margin over LIBOR is in the range 0.3% to 0.5% in accordance with a leverage grid.
As at 31 December 2007, the margin was 0.35%.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in 2011, amounted to 112.3m 2006: 86.5m, having taken into account 7.0m 2006: 7.1m utilised for letters of credit and guarantees.

66 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2007 17 Provisions continued From time-to-time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business.
The outcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of 7.5m 2006: 4.0m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outflow relating to the provisions is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 27.
On the expiry of certain contracts, the Group will incur costs to dispose of assets, repair premises and reduce headcount.
The other provision of 1.0m 2006: 0.5m is an estimate of the cost of meeting these obligations.

22 Employee benefits Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom and one in Hong Kong.
The United Kingdom schemes are the Intertek Pension Scheme and the Capcis Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme that came into the Group through the acquisition of the Umitek group in January 2007.
These are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.
The Group recognises any actuarial gains and losses in each period in equity through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
a The total pension cost included in operating profit for the Group was: 2007 2006 m m Defined contribution schemes 11.3 8.4 Defined benefit schemes current service cost 1.9 2.2 Pension cost included in operating profit 13.2 10.6 See b below for pension interest cost and expected return on scheme assets recognised in the income statement.

The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets at the balance sheet date.
A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments.
This is based on an out-performance assumption over gilt yields.
The actual return on scheme assets was as follows: United Kingdom schemes Hong Kong 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Actual return 4.0 2.8 1.6 1.8 j Life expectancy assumptions at year end for: United Kingdom schemes Hong Kong 2007 2006 2007 2006 Male aged 40 47.4 47.3 n a n a Male aged 65 21.9 21.8 n a n a Female aged 40 50.2 50.2 n a n a Female aged 65 24.8 24.7 n a n a The retirement arrangement in Hong Kong pays lump sums to members instead of pensions at the point they retire.
Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the members, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong scheme.
The table above shows the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31 December.
The 2007 and 2006 mortality assumptions are based on an actuarial table PA 92 medium cohort, projected by an individuals year of birth.

Details of the share option schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 46. c Equity-settled transactions In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for shares and share options granted to employees, is measured by reference to the fair value of shares and share options granted.
In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to share option grants made prior to 7 November 2002.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes formula, a financial model used to calculate the fair value of shares and share options.
During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group recognised an expense of 3.0m 2006: 2.4m in respect of outstanding share and share option awards granted from 7 November 2002 onwards.

26 Financial instruments Details of the Groups treasury controls, exposures to credit, liquidity, interest rate and currency risks are set out in the Business and Financial Review on pages 22 to 24. a Credit risk i Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2007 2006 m m Trade receivables, net of allowance 147.5 120.4 Cash and cash equivalents 58.6 49.5 Interest rate swaps used for hedging 0.7 0.4 205.4 170.3 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the balance sheet date by geographic region was as follows: 2007 2006 m m Americas 49.5 40.8 Europe, Middle East and Africa 51.1 44.1 Asia Pacific 46.9 35.5 147.5 120.4 ii Impairment losses The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2007 2006 m m Under 6 months 142.1 115.5 Between 6 and 12 months 7.5 6.7 Over 12 months 4.3 3.2 153.9 125.4 Allowance for impairment 6.4 5.0 Trade receivables, net of allowance 147.5 120.4 Included in receivables due under 6 months of 142.1m are receivables of 69.1m 2006: 55.2m which are not due for payment under the Groups standard terms and conditions of sale.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2007 2006 m m Balance at beginning of year 5.0 6.1 Exchange differences 0.3 0.6 Cash recovered 0.2 1.1 Impairment loss recognised 3.0 2.6 Receivables written off 1.7 2.0 Impairment allowance for doubtful receivables 6.4 5.0 There were no significant individual impairments of trade receivables.
Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group assesses periodically the creditworthiness of customers.
The Groups credit risk is diversified due to the large number of entities that make up the Groups customer base and the diversification across many different industries and geographic regions.
Allowance for impairment is based on the risk profile of the receivable, based on the likelihood of the amount being recovered.
Based on historic default rates reflecting the track record of payments by the Groups customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides fully for all receivables over 12 months old as these are considered likely to be irrecoverable.
Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specific receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable.
At that time the receivable is written off.

Interest rate swaps, denominated in various currencies and an interest rate cap have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure within the Groups policy.
The swaps mature over the next three years and have fixed swap rates ranging from 1.1% to 5.3%.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 55.4m 2006: 97.4m and an interest rate cap with a notional value of 14.7m 2006: nil.
The Group designates interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of swaps and caps at 31 December 2007 was 0.7m 2006: 0.4m comprising assets of nil 2006: 0.4m and liabilities of 0.7m 2006: nil.
These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
ii Profile The information about the contractual maturities and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in section b liquidity risk, above.
The interest rate profile of the Groups short-term deposits and cash at 31 December 2007 is set out below: Total Effective At floating carrying amount interest rates interest rates Interest free and fair value Financial assets m m m Short-term deposits and cash : Sterling 5.6% 6.2 6.2 US dollar 5.2% 16.3 16.3 Chinese renminbi 1.8% 17.0 17.0 Hong Kong dollar 3.9% 1.2 1.2 Euro 3.8% 1.5 6.8 8.3 Other currencies Various 14.2 7.8 22.0 Total cash and cash equivalents 44.0 14.6 58.6 Short-term deposits are overnight deposits bearing interest at rates fixed daily in advance.
80 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2007 26 Financial instruments continued The interest rate profile of the Groups short-term deposits and cash at 31 December 2006 was as follows: Total Effective At floating carrying amount interest rates interest rates Interest free and fair value Financial assets m m m Short-term deposits and cash : Sterling 4.7% 0.6 0.6 US dollar 5.0% 9.3 0.8 10.1 Chinese renminbi 0.8% 13.3 13.3 Hong Kong dollar 3.9% 3.5 3.5 Euro 2.7% 1.8 4.3 6.1 Other currencies Various 11.4 4.5 15.9 Total cash and cash equivalents 39.9 9.6 49.5 Short-term deposits are overnight deposits bearing interest at rates fixed daily in advance.
iii Sensitivity At 31 December 2007, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.2m 2006: 0.5m.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
d Foreign currency risk The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies.
i Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2007, the fair value of forward exchange contracts was nil 2006: nil.
ii Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the loans at 31 December 2007 was 230.7m 2006: 178.4m.
A foreign exchange loss of 3.2m 2006: gain of 20.5m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
iii Sensitivity It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of the sterling against the dollar, the main currency impacting the Group, would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2007 by approximately 0.8m 2006: 0.7m.
The forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
e Fair values The table below sets out a comparison of the book values and corresponding fair values of all the Groups financial instruments by class.

Interest rate swaps used for hedging Bank valuations are used to estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps used for hedging.
Valuations are tested by considering the equivalent swap rate as at 31 December and calculating the difference in interest earned at this rate compared to the original swap rate.
Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted market price, if available.
If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of interest bearing loans and borrowings is equal to the book value, since the floating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end.
Trade and other receivables payables For trade and other receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates at the reporting date are used to discount future cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
27 Contingent liabilities 2007 2006 m m Guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds 7.1 6.4 Litigation From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with former employees.
