EEV assumptions a Principal economic assumptions deterministic Economic assumptions are actively reviewed and are based on the market yields on risk-free assets at the valuation date.
2007 2006 UK and International excluding Lombard : % % Risk-free rate i 4.6 4.6 Investment returns before tax: Fixed interest 4.6-5.9 3.95.9 Equities 7.6 7.6 Properties 6.6 6.6 Future expense inflation: UK business 4.5 4.3 International business 4.5 4.3 UK and OLAB corporation tax rate 30 28 30 Isle of Man corporation tax rate ii 30 28 0 i For UK and FPI business the risk-free rate is set with reference to the gilt yield curve at the valuation date.
For annuity business a termdependent rate allowing for the shape of the yield curve is used as this can significantly impact value.
For other business, a rate based on the annualised 15-year gilt yield is used.
ii Isle of Man corporation tax rate is 0%.
It has been assumed that all distributable profits will be repatriated as dividends and hence a full UK rate has been applied.
2007 2006 Lombard: % % Risk-free rate 4.7 4.1 Investment returns before tax: Fixed interest 4.7-5.7 4.15.1 Equities 7.7 7.1 Cash 4.1 3.7 Future expense inflation 4.1 4.0 Tax rate 29.6 25.2 The key exchange rates used in respect of Lombard business were a closing exchange rate of 1 Euro 0.734 2006: 1 Euro 0.674 and an average exchange rate over the year of 1 Euro 0.678.
Margins are added to the risk-free rates to obtain investment return assumptions for equity and property.
For corporate fixed interest securities the investment return assumptions are derived from an AA-bond yield spread, limited to the actual return on the underlying assets.
As a market-consistent approach has been followed, these investment return assumptions affect only the derived risk discount rates and not the embedded value result.

EEV assumptions continued Maintenance expenses for UK and International business excluding Lombard are assumed to increase in the future at a rate of 1% per annum in excess of the assumed long-term rate of retail price inflation.
This is derived from the difference between the risk-free rate of return and the average of the FTSE Actuaries over five-year index-linked gilt yield at 5% and 0% inflation.
For Lombard the risk-free rate is the average of the 1015 year and the over 15 year yields using the EuroMTS indices.
The investment return assumption is the weighted average based on an assumed asset mix of returns on fixed interest securities, equities and cash.
The Lombard investment return assumption is shown gross of tax, but net of fund management charges.
Derived risk discount rates by product type Average derived risk discount rates are shown below for the embedded value and the contribution from new business.
The average derived risk discount rate for the in-force has increased over 2007, for annuities particularly, owing mainly to widening corporate bond spreads.
A more detailed split of the derived risk discount rates is given in the following table.
