notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 January 31 December.
Segment information continued The business segment is the secondary segment, and is based on the main service areas defined in the Groups strategy plan.
As the Group does not fully allocate balances to the service areas within Facility Services, only revenue is disclosed for the different service areas within the business segment.
Compared to 2006, the secondary segment has been amended to reflect a pure service type segmentation.
In 2006, the secondary segment also included Integrated Facility Services, which reflects a service delivery method rather than an actual service type.
Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
