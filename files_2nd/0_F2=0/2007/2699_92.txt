At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 1 Revised Presentation of financial statements IAS 23 Revised Borrowing costs IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and separate financial statements Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment to IFRS 2 Share based payment IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for IFRS 3 Revised should the Group undertake material acquisitions in the future.
c Preparation of financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
In 2006, we completed the disposal of our beverage businesses in Europe and South Africa.
These businesses were classified as discontinued operations in 2006. d Basis of consolidation The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements.
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company including all of its subsidiary entities after eliminating internal transactions and recognising any minority interests in those entities.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Minority interests are shown as a component of equity in the balance sheet and the share of profit attributable to minority interests is shown as a component of profit for the period in the consolidated income statement.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the financial year are included in Group profit from the effective date of control.
The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the effective date of control.
Results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the financial year are included in Group profit up to the effective date of disposal.
Entities in which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not have the power to control or jointly control are associated undertakings.
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control.
