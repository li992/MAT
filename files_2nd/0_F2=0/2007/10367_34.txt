Misys plc Annual Report 2007 73 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements 5 Share-based payments continued Share-based payment charges Share-based payment charges are calculated by spreading the fair value of an option over the vesting period having taken into account any performance conditions when estimating the number of options expected to vest.
The vesting period is typically three years from date of grant or the beginning of the bonus year in respect of grants under the MSEBP.
All options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model except grants under the LTIP and TIP which use the Monte Carlo option pricing model as they have market performance conditions which are included in the fair value calculation.
The following assumptions have been used in the option pricing models: all figures in millions2 007 2006 2005 Risk-free interest rate % 4.6 5.0 4.1 4.2 4.9 5.3 Dividend yield % 3.2 3.3 2.6 i Volatility of Misys plc ordinary shares %: Share option schemes nil cost 33 37 47 82 Share option schemes market value 37 56 61 66 67 Savings-related share option schemes 34 36 47 82 Expected lives years of options granted under: Share option schemes nil cost 3 3 3 4 Share option schemes market value 5 6.5 6.5 4.5 6.5 Savingsrelated share option schemes 3 33 i Expected volatility was calculated using the share price history for the period equivalent to the expected life.
The following additional assumptions have been used for the Monte Carlo option pricing models: LTIP Total Shareholder Return 2007 2006 2005 i Volatility of the top 30 TechMark companies % 32 44 51 ii Correlation coefficient 0.17 0.16 0.19 i Expected volatility was calculated using the share price history for the period equivalent to the expected life.
ii The share price correlation between the top 30 TechMark companies was determined by the historical correlation of the share price movements over the same period as the volatility.
All models incorporate the share price at the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for options granted during the year was 2.22 2006: 2.35: 2005: 1.86.
