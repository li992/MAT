Goodwill Group 2007 2006 m m Cost At 1 July Acquisitions in the year note 29 816.7 At 30 June 816.7 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 July Impairment losses for the year At 30 June Carrying amount At 1 July At 30 June 816.7 The goodwill balance relates to the acquisition of Wilson Bowden on 26 April 2007.
Goodwill of 792.2m has been allocated to the housebuilding segment and 24.5m has been allocated to the commercial development segment.
The goodwill balance has been allocated to both segments as it is attributable to: the highly complementary geographical t, which will enable the Group to deliver synergies from the rationalisation of the number of operational divisions and consolidation of the central functions the acquisition of the skills and experience within the workforce of Wilson Bowden an increased consented land bank enabling increased operational exibility increased access to commercial and mixed-use developments access to an expanded portfolio of strategic land and the associated skills within the Wilson Bowden strategic land team An impairment review was performed at 30 June 2007 comparing the value-in-use of the housebuilding and commercial development segments with the carrying value of their assets and allocated goodwill.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash ows of the housebuilding and commercial development segments.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and expected changes in site costs to complete.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the housebuilding and commercial development businesses and therefore the discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 12.0%.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
As a result of this review no impairment was recorded.

Intangible assets continued The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at 100.0m, as the Directors consider that this has an indefinite life.
The Directors consider that this brand has an indefinite life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for an indefinite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m is being amortised over ten years as it is a business to business brand operating in niche markets.
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts are determined using value-in-use calculations.

These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash ows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment.
The movement in fair value during the year that has been recognised in equity is shown in note 27.
Available for sale financial assets are non-interest bearing, and the Group has no concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of customers and the amounts secured over a number of freehold and leasehold properties.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of the available for sale financial assets is equivalent to their fair value as the time value of money is taken into account when calculating their carrying value.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 23.

Gross deferred tax assets and liabilities are: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Deferred tax assets 35.7 40.4 21.5 29.4 Deferred tax liabilities 38.8 3.1 40.4 21.5 29.4 In addition to the above, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset of 1.8m 2006: nil in respect of capital and other losses that are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.
The impact of the changes introduced in the Finance Act 2007 regarding Industrial Buildings Allowances and impact of the reduction in the corporation tax rate from April 2008 to 28% has been to reduce the Groups tax charge by 1.9m in the year due to the reduction in deferred tax provided.
The effect of the changes to be enacted in the Finance Act 2008 would be to increase the deferred tax liability provided at 30 June 2007 by approximately 0.8m.
The increase in the deferred tax liability would decrease the profit after tax in the income statement by 0.8m.
This increase in the deferred tax liability is due to the phasing out of Industrial Building Allowances from 2007 onwards.
Inventories Group 2007 2006 m m Land held for development 3,296.6 1,997.3 Construction work in progress 1,368.5 603.8 Part exchange properties 97.9 35.6 Other inventories 6.6 7.7 4,769.6 2,644.4 The Directors consider all inventories to be current in nature.
The operational cycle is such that a significant proportion of inventories will not be realised within twelve months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specic inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The value of inventories expensed in 2007 and included in cost of sales was 2,354.4m 2006: 1,740.7m.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2007 was 3.5m 2006: nil.
The value of inventories recognised as an expense in the year was reduced by the reversal of 1.4m 2006: nil that was written down in a previous accounting period.
The reversals arose mainly due to obtaining planning approval on strategic land and other interests that had been previously written down to net realisable value.

Total payables include 116.0m 2006: 76.1m secured by legal charges on certain assets.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of the trade and other payables included in current liabilities approximates to fair value as a result of the short maturity period of the amounts as at the year end.
Trade payables included in non-current liabilities are carried at their discounted present value of expected future cash ows using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate used in the calculation is 5.25% 2006: 5.25%.

In addition, the Group had 129.6m of undrawn uncommitted facilities available at 30 June 2007 2006: 62.8m.
d Gross borrowings maturity prole The maturity prole of the Groups and Companys borrowings is as follows: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m In less than one year or on demand 26.7 5.9 49.1 In more than one year but not more than two years 835.8 0.5 835.8 In more than two years but not more than five years 620.8 1.9 620.8 In more than five years 0.1 1,483.3 8.4 1,456.6 49.1 Less amounts due for repayment within 12 months 26.7 5.9 49.1 Amount due for settlement after 12 months 1,456.6 2.5 1,456.6 e Interest rates and fair value All borrowings are recorded at amortised cost.

The oating rates are xed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term exibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for oating rate borrowings in 2007 was 5.7% 2006: 5.1%.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The fair value of oating rate loans at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 is considered to be equal to the book value as the interest rate on the loans and borrowings is linked to United Kingdom bank rate.
The cash ow interest rate risks of 860.0m of the oating rate debt has been hedged using swap arrangements as detailed below.
Fixed rate sterling private placement notes of 81.8m 2006: nil were arranged at xed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for xed rate sterling private placement notes for 2007 was 7.5% 2006: nil with, at 30 June 2007, a weighted average period of 2.5 years 2006: nil for which the rate is xed.
The fair value of xed rate sterling private placement notes has been determined by using the current value calculated at the acquisition of Wilson Bowden.
At 30 June 2007, if interest rates had been 25 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit would decrease increase by 1.4m 2006: 0.5m decrease increase.
f Derivative financial instruments swaps The Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash ow risks, related to interest rates, arising from the Groups sources of finance.
At 30 June 2007 the Group had outstanding oating rate sterling debt and overdrafts of 1,401.5m 2006: 8.4m.
In obtaining this funding the Group sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to swap 860.0m 2006: nil of this debt into xed rate sterling debt in accordance with the Group treasury policy outlined in note 23.
After taking into account swap arrangements, the xed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows: Fixed rate Amount payable m % Maturity 210.0 5.79 2012 200.0 5.62 2017 100.0 5.92 2017 100.0 5.95 2017 150.0 5.42 2022 100.0 5.71 2022 860.0 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 73 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 22.
Loans, borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued f Derivative financial instruments swaps continued The swap arrangements are designated as a cash ow hedge against future interest rate movements.
The fair value of the swap arrangements at 30 June 2007, which is based on third party valuations, was 12.3m 2006: nil with a gain of 12.3m 2006: nil being credited directly to equity in the year.
In addition, 1.5m was transferred to the income statement on the settlement of the former Wilson Bowden US Dollar swaps following the repayment of the former Wilson Bowden US Dollar private placement notes.
There was no 2006: nil ineffectiveness arising from the swaps to be taken through the income statement during the year.
Financial instruments The Groups financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and available for sale financial assets.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables including land payables and derivative financial instruments.
a Financial risk management The Groups operations and debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash ows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly identied and appropriate actions taken by the central treasury department.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to x interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting specic, clearly dened guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group.
A Treasury Operating Committee has been established which operates within specic parameters set by the Board and consists of any two of the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer.
In addition, the Directors approve and review all facilities and derivative transactions that they have not delegated to the Treasury Operating Committee.
The Group operates a central treasury department to implement the guidelines established by the Board, to which it reports regularly.
i Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term xed rate funding and medium-term oating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate exibility for the Groups operational requirements.
In order to achieve this the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash ow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt.
The Group has a policy that 60%-80% of the forecasted debt for the year end is at a xed rate, with an average minimum duration of five years and an average maximum duration of fifteen years.
ii Credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The exposure to credit loss on cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables is equivalent to their balance sheet carrying value.
The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The Company was exposed to 8.4m 2006: 8.4m of credit risk in relation to financial guarantees and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings at the year end.
Further details are provided in note 31. iii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Groups objective is to minimise renancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed facilities and private placement notes is at least three years.
At 30 June 2007, the average maturity of the Groups facilities was 3.5 years.

Dened benefit scheme The Group operates a funded dened benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is now closed to new entrants.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 November 2004 and updated to 30 June 2007 by a qualied independent actuary.
The projected unit method has been used to calculate the current service cost.
This will rise over time as a percentage of payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement as the scheme is closed to new members.
At the balance sheet date there were no outstanding contributions 2006: 0.7m.
Following changes introduced by the Finance Act with effect from April 2006, the dened benefit scheme has implemented revised terms for members exchanging pension at retirement date for a tax-free lump sum.
An analysis of the changes in commutation behaviour of scheme members will be undertaken by the Trustees for the 30 November 2007 actuarial valuation of the scheme.
After the results of this are made available, the Group may change its assumptions regarding commutation.
Accordingly, no gain or loss has been recognised in the period.
The assets of the dened benefit scheme have been calculated at fair value.
The liabilities of the scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: 2007 2006 Principal actuarial assumptions Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 5.80% 5.25% Rate of compensation increase 5.30% 5.00% Rate of price ination 3.30% 3.00% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 5.25% 4.95% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets during the financial year 6.19% 5.87% Rate of compensation increase 5.00% 4.75% Rate of price ination 3.00% 2.75% The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities.
