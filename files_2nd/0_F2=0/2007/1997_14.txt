Notes to the Consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed on page 57.
The following interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006 and have been adopted in the preparation of these accounts: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 applicable for financial years commencing on or after 1 May 2006.
IAS 21 Amendment Net investment in a foreign operation applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
IAS 39 Amendment Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
IAS 39 Amendment The fair value option applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
The adoption of these standards has no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing Costs The Group has not adopted these Standards and Interpretations early.
Their adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain the benefits from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiary undertakings have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Joint ventures Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
The carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
co. uk Revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year.
Properties are treated as sold and profits are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
This policy applies to both residential housebuilding and commercial property activities.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward sale of part exchange properties, for which the net gain or loss is recognised in cost of sales.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Borrowing costs Interest is written off to the income statement as incurred.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 under UK GAAP was not reinstated on transition to IFRS and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, which include customer contracts, have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and fittings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% www.
co. uk 55 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Leasehold property is amortised over the period of the lease.
Computer equipment is included within fixtures and fittings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is identified and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Inventories Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Progress payments are deducted from work in progress.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at fair value.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the fair value differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances in hand and at the bank, including bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form part of the Groups cash management, for which offset arrangements across Group businesses have been applied where appropriate.
Share capital Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
Derivative financial instruments From time to time the Group makes use of interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are stated at fair value.
Where the derivative instrument is deemed an effective hedge over the interest rate exposure, the instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge, and hedge accounting is applied, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity until such time as the gains or losses are realised.
On realisation, any gains are reported in the income statement net of related charges.
co. uk Employee benefits a Pensions The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
The Group has also adopted early the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to equity through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Since the Group has elected to follow this approach, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes have been recognised at the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period 1 May 2004.
For defined benefit schemes, the obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a qualified actuary.
The operating and financing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of the employees and financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses were recognised at 1 May 2004, the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period, within the net obligation at that date.
Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
b Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The fair value of awards under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans at the date of grant are charged against profit on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Groups estimate of the awards that will eventually vest.
Shares held in trust to satisfy these awards are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Leasing and rental agreements Payments under rental and operating lease agreements are charged against profit on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management apply the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgements, of which no individual judgement is deemed to have a significant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore, due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to forecast the costs to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b Pensions Pension assumptions are set out within Note 5 and are as advised by the Groups actuary.
The assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate used and the mortality rates.
Such estimations are based on assumed rates and, should these differ from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
c Goodwill impairment In determining whether or not goodwill is impaired or not requires an estimation of value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, the future growth rate of revenue and costs, and a suitable discount rate.
For this reason segment reporting is only presented by business segment.
Included in Group residential housebuilding revenue and operating profit are 43,997,000 and 9,245,000 2006: 1,142,000 and 889,000 in respect of land sales.
Unallocated income, costs, assets and liabilities relate to those areas that are managed centrally by the Group, and cannot be reasonably allocated to the business segments.
These comprise the Groups net cash debt and associated interest receivable and payable, the current tax creditor, the deferred tax asset and the tax charge, and the retirement benefit obligation.

Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of other services relates largely to financial due diligence, and also includes 25,000 in respect of the interim review 2006: 25,000.
In addition to the above services, the Groups auditor acted as auditor to The Berkeley Group plc Staff Benefit Plan and The Berkeley Group Money Purchase Pension Plan.
The appointment of auditors to the Groups pension schemes and the fees paid in respect of those audits are agreed by the trustees of each scheme, who act independently of the management of the Group.
The aggregate fees paid to the Groups auditors for audit services to the pension schemes during the year were 12,000 2006: 12,000.
Operating expenses represent administration costs.

Pensions At the start of the year, three principal pension schemes were in place for employees.
The Berkeley Group plc Staff Benefits Plan the Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a defined benefit scheme and had been closed to new entrants from 1 May 2002.
The Berkeley Group plc Money Purchase Scheme the Berkeley Money Purchase Plan and the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan the St George Group Personal Pension Plan are defined contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
With effect from 1 November 2006, the Berkeley Money Purchase Plan was closed, with future employer contributions being paid into The Berkeley Group plc Group Personal Pension Plan the Berkeley Group Personal Pension Plan, also a defined contribution scheme.
During the year, all members active and deferred were offered a transfer value from the Berkeley Final Salary Plan to their own private pension arrangements and a potential enhanced transfer value from the Berkeley Final Salary Plan or a cash payment.
Contributions to the Berkeley Final Salary Plan ceased at 30 September 2006.
The offer was made to all employees and did not vary by grade.
The Berkeley Group Personal Pension Plan was established to receive transfers and future contributions from 1 October 2006.
The majority of active and deferred members accepted this offer.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
Included in Wages and salaries and Social security costs for the year in the table above are 2,586,000 and 340,000 in respect of payments to active members of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan who elected to receive the transfer value enhancement as a cash payment.
Payments to deferred members who elected to receive the enhanced transfer value as a cash payment were 3,413,000.
The payments resulted in a curtailment gain of 1,520,000 and a settlement gain of 4,305,000 in respect of the Groups defined benefit obligation.
In addition, 3,537,000 was paid to the Berkeley Final Salary Plan in respect of members requesting the transfer value enhancement as pension.
Fees and expenses of 1,100,000 in respect of this process are included within net operating expenses.
Defined contribution plan Contributions amounting to 1,743,000 2006: 791,000, of which 107,000 2006: 219,000 were paid on behalf of joint ventures, and nil 2006: 21,000 related to discontinued operations, were paid into the defined contribution schemes during the year.
Defined benefit plan The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2004.
The method adopted in the 2004 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment prior to and after retirement of 6.5% and 5.5% per annum respectively, pension increases for service before and after April 1997 of 3.0% and 3.7% per annum respectively and salary escalation at 4.0% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2004 was 18,100,000 and was sufficient to cover 72% of the schemes liabilities.
Up until closure of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007, employers contributions were paid at 21.1%.
With effect from 1 May 2007, employees contributions are paid at 45,000 per month.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 30 April 30 April Valuation at: 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.0% Discount rate 5.5% 5.1% Inflation assumption 3.2% 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment post-97 3.5% 3.5% Pre-97 receive 3% p. a. increases The mortality assumptions are the standard PA92 tables projected to 2014 for current pensioners and projected to 2024 for future pensioners.
The average life expectancy of male and female pensioners retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is 19.3 years and 22.3 years respectively 2006: 19.3 and 22.3.
The average life expectancy of male and female pensioners retiring at age 65 after the balance sheet date is 20.1 years and 23.1 years respectively 2006: 20.1 and 23.1.

Share-based payments The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments in the year, relating to grants of shares awarded under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan after 7 November 2002 and under The Berkeley Group Holdings 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan, was 5,661,000 2006: 6,347,500.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2000 LTIP No awards were granted under the 2000 LTIP during the year 2006: nil.
Further details on the 2000 LTIP are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on page 43.
The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP On 26 October 2004, under the terms of the 2004 b LTIP, the Company granted four Executive Directors the right to receive, at no cost, 21,321,361 ordinary shares in aggregate on 31 January 2011, if the Company has returned to shareholders 12 per share by that date.
The price of a Unit each Unit comprising one ordinary share of 5p, one 2004 B share of 5p, one 2006 B share of 5p, one 2008 B share of 5p and one 2010 B share of 5p in the Company at 26 October 2004 was 1,180p.
The fair value of the awards at the date of grant was 162p per Unit.
The fair value calculated was based on the share price at the date of grant, net of the discounted present value of expected returns to shareholders over the six-year vesting period.
The Company intends that, prior to 31 January 2011, substantially all returns to shareholders will be by way of payments made on the B shares 500p per Unit paid in December 2004, 200p per Unit paid in January 2007, 200p per Unit payable in January 2009 and 300p per Unit payable in January 2011.
None of the awards granted under this Scheme are expected to lapse by 31 January 2011.
The charge to the income statement in the year of grant was 2,860,000, and the annual charge to the income statement thereafter until the vesting date is expected to be 5,610,000.
There were no further grants under the 2004 b LTIP in the year, and no further grants are expected under this Scheme.

For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares relate to shares granted under employee share schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Ordinary Shares during the year.
The effect of the dilutive Ordinary potential shares is 388,267 shares 2006: 681,083, giving a diluted weighted average number of shares of 120,724,003 2006: 120,748,127.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out in the table below: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average number Per-share number Per-share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount 000 000 pence 000 000 pence Basic earnings per Ordinary Share 135,545 120,336 112.6 202,147 120,067 168.4 Effect of dilutive potential shares 388 681 Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share 135,545 120,724 112.3 202,147 120,748 167.4 Basic earnings per Ordinary Share 135,545 120,336 112.6 202,147 120,067 168.4 Basic earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing operations 135,545 120,336 112.6 121,365 120,067 101.1 Basic earnings per Ordinary Share from discontinued operations 80,782 120,067 67.3 Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share 135,545 120,724 112.3 202,147 120,748 167.4 Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing operations 135,545 120,724 112.3 121,365 120,748 100.5 Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share from discontinued operations 80,782 120,748 66.9 Net assets per Ordinary Share is calculated based on net assets at the end of the year divided by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue at the end of the year of 120,426,806 2006: 120,127,341.
This excludes shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Return on capital employed ROCE is calculated based on profit before interest and tax including joint venture profit before tax divided by the average shareholders funds adjusted for net cash debt.
co. uk The goodwill balance relates to the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited that was not already owned by the Group.
The acquisition was completed on 7 November 2006 and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of 17,159,000.
The calculation of this goodwill is set out in note 25.
The factors which give rise to goodwill include a premium for gaining full control of the strategy and direction of the acquired business, for bringing St James Group Limiteds strong management team into the Group and for other control-based synergies.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the current five-year divisional forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash flows beyond the initial five-year period are extrapolated assuming steady returns.
ii A discount rate of 8% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The goodwill balance has been allocated to residential housebuilding within the segmental analysis.
Other intangible assets relate to contracts for the sale of units that had reserved or exchanged at the date of the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited that it did not already own see note 25.
This resulted in an intangible asset of 3,272,000 at the acquisition date.
This intangible asset is amortised as these reserved or exchanged units are taken to profit.

The Group finances its operations by a combination of shareholders funds and net borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash at bank and in hand, bank loans, loan stock, trade receivables and trade payables, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments when commercially appropriate to manage cash flow risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2006: nil.
All of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling and hence the Group has no exposure to currency risk.

Other non-current liabilities principally comprise long-term land creditors which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The carrying value of bank loans and overdrafts equates to their fair value.

c Proposed Investment with Saad Investments Company Limited in three new joint venture companies On 2 April 2007, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, The Berkeley Group plc, had entered into three agreements, which were subsequently approved by shareholders, to establish three further private joint venture companies with Saad Investments Company Limited Saad, including an investment of up to 175 million.
In addition to being a partner in an existing joint venture, Saad is currently a 29.4% shareholder in the Company and therefore under the Listing Rules is considered a related party by virtue of being a substantial shareholder.
The first of the three joint venture companies will operate as a land fund Saad Berkeley Regeneration Limited to acquire new development opportunities adding value through securing enhanced planning consents, prior to disposal to either third parties or the second of the joint venture companies.
This second company will operate as a development company Saad Berkeley Developments Limited, primarily developing the land purchased by Saad Berkeley Regeneration Limited once planning permission is obtained.
The third company will operate as a property investment company Saad Berkeley Investments Limited.
Saad Berkeley Regeneration Limited will invest in development opportunities which cannot be accommodated within the Companys usual acquisition criteria.
These might include land options, freehold land or land currently with commercial use with a high capital requirement and or relatively long planning lead time.
Such opportunities can, however, offer attractive returns and are, in the view of the Company, ideally suited to joint ventures, which can utilise financial leverage to reflect the capital intensive nature and risk profile of the sites, whilst limiting the Groups exposure.
Saad Berkeley Regeneration Limited will therefore be complementary to Berkeleys core business, acquiring sites that Berkeley normally would not.
Once suitable planning permission is obtained by Saad Berkeley Regeneration Limited, the sites will be sold for development, either to third parties or to Saad Berkeley Developments Limited.
Saad Berkeley Investments Limited will acquire commercial property as opportunities are identified by its board of directors with a view to achieving returns primarily through capital growth.
Berkeley has previously conducted such activities through Saad Berkeley Investment Properties Limited and Berkeley Eastoak Investments Limited, both joint ventures with Saad, and the Property Investment Company is a continuation of this.
Commercial property investment is commonly undertaken through joint ventures or special purpose vehicles that utilise financial leverage to maximise shareholder returns and for Berkeley this also reflects the fact that such investment is of an opportunistic nature.
Funding of the three joint venture companies will be through a combination of shareholder investment and non-recourse bank funding with a target equity to debt ratio of 30:70.
Berkeleys investment in the joint venture companies, in the form of both shareholder capital and loans, will not exceed 175 million in aggregate.
Initially, Berkeley is committed to providing loan facilities of 92 million in aggregate.
Investment is expected to occur over a 10-year period as appropriate acquisition and investment opportunities are identified by the three joint venture companies and the respective boards request the funds from their shareholders.
The establishment of the three joint venture companies was completed in May 2007 with the incorporation of these three companies.
