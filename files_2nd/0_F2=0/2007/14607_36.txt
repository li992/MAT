qxd:13481SPEEDYHI 5 6 07 14:01 Page 64 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 16 Financial instruments The Group holds and uses financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage its interest rate and liquidity risks.
The Group primarily finances its operations using share capital, retained profits and borrowings.
The Group had in issue at 31 March 2007 a 210m revolving credit facility, and a 5m overdraft facility.
The Group does not engage in trading or speculative activities using derivative financial instruments.
A Group offset arrangement exists for cash balances to take advantage of the most rewarding short-term investment opportunities.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities There are no significant differences between the fair values and book values of financial assets and liabilities.
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: a Derivatives Broker quotes are used for all interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
b Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
c Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
d Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit, interest rate, foreign currency, and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks and they have remained unchanged since 2004. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
No individual customer accounts for more than 4% of the Groups sales transactions.
No collateral is held as security in respect of amounts outstanding: however, in a number of instances, deposits are held against the value of hire equipment provided.
The extent of deposit taken is assessed on a case-by-case basis, and is not considered significant in comparison to the overall amounts receivable from customers.
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are undertaken with counterparties within the syndicate of banks which provide the Groups revolving credit facility.
Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that is based on historical experience of dealing with customers within the same risk profile.
Liquidity risk At 31 March 2007 the total bank facilities comprised a 210m revolving credit facility and a 5m overdraft facility.
Of these facilities, 38.8m remained unutilised at the balance sheet date comprising 33.8m of the revolving credit facility and 5.0m of the overdraft facility.
The maturing date of the revolving credit facility is August 2010.
The Group monitors available facilities against forward requirements on a regular basis and where necessary, obtains additional sources of financing to provide the Group with the appropriate level of headroom against the required borrowing.
The Group has obtained additional bank and equity funding in recent years as the business has grown, and maintains close contact with its syndicate of banks.

Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases denominated in euros, primarily as a result of trading in the Republic of Ireland through its subsidiary company, Speedy Hire Ireland Limited.
It is the Groups policy to review the net investment in Speedy Hire Ireland Limited on a regular basis, and to hedge against potential exposures to movements in foreign currency where considered appropriate.
At 31 March 2007 Speedy Hire Ireland Limited had net liabilities of 0.9m, and no hedging instruments are in place to cover potential movements in foreign currency.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to a risk of a change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates as a result of its use of variable rate borrowings.
The Groups policy is to review regularly the terms of its borrowing facilities, to assess and manage the long-term borrowing commitment accordingly, and to put in place interest rate hedges to reduce the Groups exposure to significant fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 40% and 70% of its borrowings are covered by some form of interest rate hedge.
The principal derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
The notional contract amount and the fair value of the instruments are as follows: 2007 2006 Group and Company m m Designated as cash flow hedges Fixed interest rate swaps 55.0 Interest rate collars 20.0 Interest rate caps 25.0 100.0 Other instruments Fixed interest rate swaps 5.0 35.0 Interest rate collars 12.0 39.5 Interest rate caps 5.0 10.0 22.0 84.5 Total notional contract amount 122.0 84.5 Carrying value and fair value asset liability 0.7 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed interest rate hedge is 5.703% 2006: 5.463% and the instruments are for a weighted average period of 18 months 2006: 19 months.
