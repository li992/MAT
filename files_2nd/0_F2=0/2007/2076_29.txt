5260 BHPB AReport Pt1 11 9 07 6:54 PM Page 101 3.7 Liquidity and capital resources As a result of our record production volumes at 17 assets and record prices in many of our key commodities over the past several years, we have generated very strong cash flows throughout our operations.
These cash flows have been fundamental to our ability to internally fund our existing operations, maintain a pipeline of 33 growth projects, and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs.
Our priority for cash is to reinvest in the business.
In line with our strategy, we have grown our business rapidly and consistently through project developments and acquisitions.
Through a combination of borrowings and payments to shareholders, we manage our balance sheet with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing that we believe optimise our costs of capital and return on capital employed.
Net operating cash flows are our principal source of cash.
We also raise cash from debt financing to manage temporary fluctuations in liquidity arrangements and to refinance existing debt.
Over the past six years, we have returned US$28.2 billion to our shareholders through capital initiatives and dividends.

2 Growth projects Our world-class asset suite continues to provide us with an array of value-accretive growth opportunities.
We have a diversified minerals portfolio and a unique portfolio of energy assets: oil, gas, LNG, energy coal and uranium, all with important growth opportunities.
Our project pipeline provides significant future value, with 33 projects in either execution or feasibility representing an expected capital investment of US$20.9 billion.
We also have further medium-term options in our portfolio with capital expenditure requirements in excess of US$50 billion.
During the year, we continued the ramp-up of five projects, approved three additional projects and commissioned Spence, a 200,000 tonnes per annum copper operation in Chile.
We also commissioned two projects at our Queensland Coal Operations Australia.
In addition to these brownfield opportunities, we also acquired the Genghis Khan oil field, in the Gulf of Mexico, and a onethird share of the Guinea Alumina project, which consists of high-quality bauxite reserves and the development of an alumina refinery in Guinea.
We are expecting to deliver further significant growth in the next financial year with new projects commissioning or ramping up across our Petroleum, Base Metals, Iron Ore and Stainless Steel Materials CSGs.
During FY2007, we completed one major growth project.
