Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following cash-generating units have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2007 2006 000 000 UK 6,671 6,671 Continental Europe 6,539 6,539 13,210 13,210 On acquisition, each cash-generating unit is fully integrated into the groups business model and benefits from shared purchasing, common IT systems and other shared support services including warehousing and logistics.
Accordingly, it is not possible to separately test each individual cash-generating unit for goodwill impairment.
Goodwill by geographical segments has been separately identified and measured for impairment.
The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit has been assessed on a value in use basis using the operating profit of each geographical segment for 2007 and extrapolating forward assuming forecast inflationary growth rates of 3% for the territories in which the cash-generating units are located.
The group has applied a discount rate of 9.2% when measuring for impairment.
