The fair value of the interest rate swaps that had previously been taken to the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has now been recycled to the income statement.
b The total finance income for financial assets that are not at fair value through profit or loss is 0.7 million 2006: 0.6 million.

In addition the rate reflects overseas tax at rates higher than the UK rate suffered by many of the Group's operations and is also impacted by losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, and by unrelieved withholding taxes on remittances to the UK.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and their utilisation in future periods is not certain.
At 31 December 2007 there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2006: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group's subsidiaries, since the Group has no liability to additional tax because it can control the reversal of any temporary differences and has no intention to remit the earnings retained at that date.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by Foseco plc to the shareholders of the Company.
