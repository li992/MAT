The Group further breaks each geographical region into three distinct business models which offer different growth, return, risk and reward opportunities: Franchised Where Group companies neither own nor manage the hotel, but license the use of a Group brand and provide access to reservation systems, loyalty schemes and know-how.
The Group derives revenues from a brand royalty or licensing fee, based on a percentage of room revenue.
Managed Where, in addition to licensing the use of a Group brand, a Group company manages the hotel for third party owners.
The Group derives revenues from base and incentive management fees and provides the system infrastructure necessary for the hotel to operate.
Management contract fees are generally a percentage of hotel revenue and may have an additional incentive fee linked to profitability or cash flow.
The terms of these agreements vary, but are often long term for example, 10 years or more.
The Groups responsibilities under the management agreement typically include hiring, training and supervising the managers and employees that operate the hotels under the relevant brand standards.
In order to gain access to central reservation systems, global and regional brand marketing and brand standards and procedures, owners are typically required to make a further contribution.
Owned and leased Where a Group company both owns or leases and operates the hotel and, in the case of ownership, takes all the benefits and risks associated with ownership.
Segmental results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing as follows: 2007 2006 m m Americas managed operations 70 72 Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations 40 37 110 109 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Growth rates are based on management expectations and industry growth forecasts.
The growth rates used to determine cash flows beyond five years do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

After this period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on a perpetual growth rate of approximately 2.7% 2006 3.0%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.0% 2006 10.5%.
Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on an estimated growth rate of 15.0% 2006 15.0%.

The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11.0% 2006 11.0%.
With regard to the assessment of value in use, management believe that the carrying values of the CGUs would only exceed their recoverable amounts in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.

Other financial assets consist of trade deposits, restricted cash and deferred consideration on asset disposals.
These amounts have been designated as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
Restricted cash of 27m 2006 25m relates to cash held in bank accounts which is pledged as collateral to insurance companies for risks retained by the Group.

The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime allowance.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are now closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.

In respect of the UK plans, the specific mortality rates used are in line with the PA92 medium cohort tables, with age rated down by one year, implying the following life expectancies at retirement.
In the US, life expectancy is determined by reference to the RP-2000 healthy tables.

The assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
78 IHG Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.
UK US Increase Increase Higher lower decrease Higher lower decrease pension cost in liabilities pension cost in liabilities m m m m Discount rate 0.25% decrease 0.4 15.6 2.4 0.25% increase 0.4 14.7 2.3 Inflation rate 0.25% increase 0.9 14.6 0.25% decrease 0.9 13.8 Mortality rate one year increase 0.6 6.8 2.7 In 2018 the healthcare cost trend rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate.
A one percentage point increase decrease in assumed healthcare costs trend rate would increase decrease the accumulated post-employment benefit obligations as of 31 December 2007 and 2006 by approximately 1m and would increase decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net postemployment healthcare cost for the period then ended by approximately nil.
