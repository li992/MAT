The restructuring costs in 2006 principally relate to manufacturing rationalisation in the Netherlands, with further costs for the earlier restructurings in the UK and in Canada.
Other operating income relates to gains on property disposals arising from the restructuring exercises.
f Net gains losses on disposal of businesses and brands On 10 March 2006, the Groups Italian subsidiary signed an agreement to sell its cigar business, Toscano, to Maccaferri for 95 million.
The sale was subject to regulatory and governmental approval and was completed on 19 July 2006.
The sale resulted in the recognition of a loss of 19 million, reflecting an impairment charge of 15 million included in depreciation and amortisation costs in the profit from operations and 4 million of other costs included in other operating expenses in the profit from operations.
On 29 November 2006, the Group completed a trademark transfer agreement with Philip Morris International.
Under this arrangement the Group sold its Muratti Ambassador brand in certain markets, as well as the L&M and Chesterfield trademarks in Hong Kong and Macao, while acquiring the Benson & Hedges trademark in certain African countries.
These transactions resulted in a gain of 60 million included in other operating income in the profit from operations.
On 20 February 2007, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell its pipe tobacco trademarks to the Danish company, Orlik Tobacco Company A S, for 24 million.

However, the Group has retained the Dunhill and Captain Black pipe tobacco brands.
On 23 May 2007, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell its Belgian cigar factory and associated brands to the cigars division of Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni AS.

From August 2006, the Group purchased minority interests in its subsidiary in Chile for a cost of 91 million, raising the Group shareholding from 70.4 per cent to 96.6 per cent.
The goodwill arising on this transaction was 80 million and the minority interests in Group equity were reduced by 11 million.
In addition, a number of smaller acquisitions of minority interests were made during 2007 in Africa and Middle East, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 7,942 million 2006: 7,350 million included in intangible assets in the balance sheet is mainly the result of the following acquisitions: Rothmans Group 4,067 million 2006: 3,889 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 2,046 million 2006: 1,768 million : and ETI Italy 1,212 million 2006: 1,113 million.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Continental Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export market in the United Kingdom and operations in Asia-Pacific.
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to 13 2006: 13 individual cash-generating units four in Europe, one in Africa and Middle East, three in Asia-Pacific, three in Latin America and two in America-Pacific.
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of South Africa 814 million, 2006: 803 million, Continental Europe 1,112 million, 2006: 1,020 million, Canada 2,046 million, 2006: 1,768 million and Italy 1,218 million, 2006: 1,119 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 British American Tobacco 109 DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 9 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of all cash-generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount of all units are the long term growth rate and the discount rate.
The long term growth rate is a nominal rate used purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
These assumptions have been applied to the individual cash flows of each unit as compiled by local management in the different markets.
The valuation uses cash flow projections based on detailed financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period, with cash flow beyond two years extrapolated by a nominal growth rate of 3 per cent per annum for the years 3 to 10, whereafter a zero per cent growth rate has been assumed.
This long term growth rate used does not exceed the expected long term average growth rate for the markets in which the cash-generating units operate.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions or start-up ventures, the valuation is expanded to reflect the medium term plan of management, spanning five years or beyond, with the cash flow beyond these years to year 10, extrapolated by the growth rate of 3 per cent, as above.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 7.9 per cent and 18.7 per cent 2006: 8.1 per cent to 17.9 per cent were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for country area inflation and economical and political risks.
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 12.1 per cent for South Africa 2006: 12.1 per cent, 9.3 per cent for Continental Europe 2006: 9.8 per cent, 10.0 per cent for Canada 2006: 10.0 per cent and 10.7 per cent for Italy 2006: 10.7 per cent.
Aside from the amounts written off and shown as part of restructuring costs see page 101 note 3 b, no impairment charges were recognised in 2007 2006: nil.
If discounted cash flows per cash-generating unit should fall by 10 per cent, or the discount rate was increased at an after-tax rate of 1 per cent, there would be no impairment.

The acquisition was funded principally with debt, and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were US$4.1 billion and US$0.6 billion respectively.
Included in the assets were US$2.5 billion in respect of goodwill and US$1.4 billion in respect of brands.
The Groups share of non-current assets above includes 529 million 2006: 540 million of goodwill and 290 million 2006: 300 million of brands arising from the Conwood acquisition.
In addition, the non-current assets above include 1,187 million 2006: 1,207 million of goodwill and 463 million 2006: 479 million of brands arising from the Reynolds American transaction in 2004.
Details of the Groups contingent liabilities are set out on page 153 in note 30.
In addition to US litigation involving Group companies, which is covered by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT indemnity referred to in note 30, Reynolds American Inc. RAI group companies are named in litigation which does not involve Group companies.
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash flows of RAI, in particular quarterly or annual periods, could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.
The Groups share of the RAI results for the year to 31 December 2007 includes 18 million 2006: 24 million in respect of external legal fees and other external product liability defence costs.

com annualreport2007 12 Retirement benefit schemes The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate around 160 retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally, although the Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The principal pension schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together these schemes account for over 88 per cent of the total obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
In addition, the Group operates significant schemes in Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benefits such as healthcare.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit credit method.
The amounts recognised in the Balance Sheet are determined as follows: Pension schemes Healthcare schemes Total 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m m m Present value of funded scheme liabilities 4,248 4,189 17 10 4,265 4,199 Fair value of funded scheme assets 4,209 3,938 14 12 4,223 3,950 39 251 3 2 42 249 Unrecognised funded scheme surpluses 44 61 44 61 83 312 3 2 86 310 Present value of unfunded scheme liabilities 111 107 121 115 232 222 Net unrecognised actuarial gains losses 4 111 14 14 10 125 Unrecognised past service cost 1 1 1 1 197 307 110 99 307 406 The above net liability is recognised in the Balance Sheet as follows retirement benefit scheme liabilities 247 335 110 100 357 435 retirement benefit scheme assets 50 28 1 50 29 197 307 110 99 307 406 In Jamaica, the pension scheme holds shares in Carreras Group Ltd. with a fair value of 7 million 2006: 6 million.

The reduction in the amounts recognised in the Income Statement in 2007 is principally due to the change in the impact of costs related to the restructurings noted above and the effect on pension costs of restructurings in recent years, along with the recognition of previously restricted funded scheme surpluses and higher investment returns.

For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions are that real salary increases will be from 1 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount rates will be from 2 per cent to 5 per cent above inflation.
Pension increases, where allowed for, are generally assumed to be in line with inflation.

For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions are that real salary increases will be from 2 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount rates will be from 2 per cent to 5 per cent above inflation.
Discount rates are determined by reference to normal yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
For countries where there is not a deep market in such corporate bonds then the yield on government bonds is used.
Mortality assumptions are subject to regular review.
In Canada, Germany and Switzerland the same tables were used for both years.
In the UK, for post-retirement mortality assumptions at 31 December 2007 the table PXA92 B 1965 rated up one year for active and deferred members and PXA92 B 1935 table rated up three years for current pensioners, all with the medium cohort effect, have been used.
At 31 December 2006, the same tables are used, along with the medium cohort effect, however active and deferred members are rated up two years and current pensioners are rated up four years.
In the Netherlands at 31 December 2007 GBM V 2006-2050 tables with an age setback of one year for both males and females have been used.
In the Netherlands at 31 December 2006 GBM V 1995-2000 tables with an age setback of two years for males and one year for females have been used.
In Canada UP94 tables, in Germany Heubeck tables 2005G, and EVK 2000 mortality tables in Switzerland, have been used.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 British American Tobacco 117 DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued Expected rates of return are determined taking into account the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with other invested assets, and the expectations for future returns on such assets.
Valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2007 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 22 million 2006: 32 million of such losses, as realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of unused income tax losses of 101 million 2006: 67 million have no expiry date and unused income tax losses of 64 million 2006: 35 million expire after five years.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of unused capital tax losses of 4 million 2006: 10 million have no expiry date.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of 158 million 2006: 183 million and unused tax credits of 206 million 2006: 136 million.
These unrecognised deferred tax assets have no expiry period.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 5 billion in both years.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The principal restructurings provided in 2007 and 2006 are as described on page 103 in note 3 e. While some elements of the non-current provisions of 76 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that over 50 per cent will unwind in 2009 and approximately 80 per cent within five years.
Provisions in respect of acquired businesses mostly relate to those which were part of the integration of the Rothmans businesses in 1999, the transition of Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to a subsidiary in 2000 and the reorganisation of the Italian business acquired in 2003.
While some elements of the non-current provisions of 9 million will unwind over several years, it is estimated that around 50 per cent will unwind within five years.
Employee-related benefits mainly relate to long term employee benefits other than post-retirement benefits.
As the principal components of these provisions are long service awards and Jubilee payments due after a certain service period, they will unwind over several years.
It is estimated that approximately 50 per cent of the non-current provisions of 15 million will unwind within five years.

The nature of the amounts provided in respect of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows is difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided.
Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include 10 million 2006: 15 million for restructuring of existing businesses, 3 million 2006: 12 million for acquired businesses, nil 2006: 2 million for employee-related benefits and 24 million 2006: 12 million for other provisions.

There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other payables and their fair value, due to the short term duration of the majority of trade and other payables.
Trade and other payables are predominantly denominated in the functional currencies of subsidiary undertakings with less than 6 per cent in other currencies.
24 Financial instruments Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specifically, Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
Derivative contracts are only entered into to facilitate the management of these risks.
The Board reviews and agrees the overall treasury policies and procedures, delegating appropriate authority to the Finance Director, the Treasury function and the Boards of the central finance companies.
The policies include a set of financing principles including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity.
These provide a framework within which the Groups capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends and share buy-back are decided.
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Groups Balance Sheet and related notes.
The Groups management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: Annual Report and Accounts 2007 British American Tobacco 141 DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 24 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers.
The Group has a target average centrally managed debt maturity of 5 years with no more than 20 per cent of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year.
As at 31 December 2007, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 5.4 years and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year was 16.7 per cent.
It is Group policy that short term sources of funds including drawings under US dollar and euro commercial paper programmes are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash.
During 2007, the Groups central banking facility at 1.75 billion was extended on existing terms under a one year extension option with final maturity dates between March 2011 and March 2012.
The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to inter-company loans and borrowings to ensure that there is the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group.
The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings: as at 31 December 2007, the ratings from Moodys and S&P were Baa1 BBB 2006: Baa1 BBB.
The strength of the ratings has underpinned the debt issuance during 2006 and 2007 and, despite the impact of the turbulence in the financial markets, the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none of them is expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Currency risk The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling.
The Groups primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro and South African rand.
These exposures are kept under continuous review.
The Groups policy on borrowings is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Within this overall policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost effective to do so through matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
At 31 December 2007, the currency profile of the Groups gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 20 2006: 25 per cent US dollar, 53 2006: 48 per cent euro, 5 2006: 5 per cent Canadian dollar, nil 2006: 1 per cent sterling, 12 2006: 12 per cent Australian dollar and 10 2006: 9 per cent other currencies.
The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates: these exposures are not normally hedged.
Exposures also arise from: i foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries.
These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible.
The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions: and ii forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre.
To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group hedges such flows using forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.

com annualreport2007 24 Financial instruments continued IFRS7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in equity of hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group.
All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analyses.
The Group considers a 10 per cent strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change.
The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.
A 10 per cent strengthening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 21 million higher 2006: 9 million lower and items recognised directly in equity being 211 million higher 2006: 168 million higher.
A 10 per cent weakening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 21 million lower 2006: 12 million higher and items recognised directly in equity being 243 million lower 2006: 204 million lower.
The exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in equity relates to hedging of certain net asset currency positions in the Group, where the compensating effect is not included above as it arises on non-financial assets, as well as cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions and debt.
Interest rate risk The objectives of the Groups interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash flow and economic value of the Group, and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants.
Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.
The only externally imposed capital requirement the Group has is in respect of its centrally managed banking facilities, which require a gross interest cover of 4.5.
The Group targets gross interest cover to be between 5 and 9.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The Group sets targets within overall guidelines for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on both a gross 50:50 - 10 and net at least 50 per cent fixed in the short to medium term basis as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by Treasury and the Board of the main central finance company.
At 31 December 2007, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 53:47 2006: 58:42 on a gross basis and 33:67 2006: 34:66 on a net basis.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to vary the fixed and floating mix.
The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.
IFRS7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in equity of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
For the purposes of these sensitivity analyses, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included.
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 28 million lower 2006: 26 million lower and items recognised directly in equity being 1 million higher 2006: 1 million lower.
A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 28 million higher 2006: 26 million higher and items recognised directly in equity being 1 million lower 2006: 1 million higher.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 British American Tobacco 143 DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 24 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending on local practice in the countries concerned.
Certain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance provided in the Groups favour in respect of Group trade receivables, the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties.
Generally the Group targets a long term counterparty credit rating of at least A A2 however the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, sovereign risk can be the determining factor on the suitability of a counterparty.
From time to time the Group may invest in short dated corporate commercial paper: for this the Group has identified specific counterparties with a minimum short term rating of A1 P1.
Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its geographic footprint while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties.
The maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Groups Balance Sheet.
In addition, the Group has issued guarantees to third parties, part of which has been recognised on the Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS39.
The unrecognised portion of these guarantees amounts to 61 million 2006: 61 million.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group, which are included in available-for-sale investments on the consolidated Balance Sheet, but the quantum of such is not material.
Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain highly effective.
Fair value estimation Derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates to calculate the present value of all estimated flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
Other financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
For financial assets and liabilities with maturities of more than one year, fair values are based on quoted market prices, market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash flow analysis.

The respective FMCG and FTSE 100 share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.
The risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by the grant share price, adjusted for the Groups announced change in dividend policy.

The weighted average British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price at the date of exercise for cash-settled share-based arrangements exercised during the period was 16.37 2006: 14.05.
A detailed breakdown of the range of exercise prices for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements outstanding for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 are shown in the table below: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average Weighted average Weighted Number remaining average exercise Number remaining average exercise outstanding contractual price per share outstanding contractual price per share Range of exercise prices at end of year life in years at end of year life in years Nil-cost 2,278,828 5.6 n a 1,614,706 6.1 n a 5.60 to 5.98 120,844 5.0 5.96 163,481 6.1 5.97 6.39 to 8.09 174,487 5.0 7.09 267,799 6.0 7.14 2,574,159 5.5 0.76 2,045,986 6.1 1.41 Share-based payment expense The amounts recognised in the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Equity-settled share-based payments 37 41 Cash-settled share-based payments 24 9 Total amount recognised in the Income Statement page 101 note 3 a 61 50 As explained in the sections for share option schemes and other equity share-based payment arrangements, during 2007 certain awards were changed from an equity-settled to a cash-settled basis.
The fair value of the old and new awards were calculated using the valuation basis set out in the relevant sections of this note and the British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price at the date of the change.
This resulted in a net incremental charge of 3.2 million, which was reflected in a 6.4 million increase in the expense for cash-settled payments and a 3.2 million decrease in the expense for equity-settled payments.
The other main cause of the higher charge for cash-settled payments in 2007 is the increase in the British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price over the year.
