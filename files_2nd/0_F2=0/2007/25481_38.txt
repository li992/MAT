Share based payments The group operates share option and share purchase schemes for employees, the majority of which are on an equity settled basis.
The purpose of the staff share schemes is to promote an 'esprit fide corps' within the organisation, create an awareness of Investec's performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group.
Further information on the group share options and long-term incentive plans are provided on pages 132 to 138 of the remuneration report.
