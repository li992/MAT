All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The Company has a dormant, wholly owned subsidiary The Mercantile Investment Trust Limited.
Consolidated accounts have not been prepared as exemption under S229 of the Companies Act 1985 has been exercised due to the immateriality of the subsidiary.
b Valuation of investments Investments are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with FRS 26 : Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Listed investments are valued at bid market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board takes into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the income statement within Gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are also included within this caption.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in the capital column.
UK dividends are included net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the income statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to the revenue column on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to the revenue column on an accruals basis.
Stock lending income and underwriting commission are taken to the revenue column on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: management fees are allocated 50% to the revenue column and 50% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of an investment are charged to the capital column.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
In accordance with the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is now required and can be found in note 10.
JPMorgan Fleming Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 33 e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 50% to the revenue column of the income statement and 50% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.

f Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debentures in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised as they arise.
g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the income statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
h Functional currency In accordance with FRS 23: The Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency, the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board has determined that Sterling is the Companys functional currency, which is also the currency in which these accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the revenue column or capital column of the income statement, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
i Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.

Taxation UK Corporation tax at 30% 2005: 30% Current tax The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30%.
The difference is explained below.
2007 2006 000 000 Net revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation 35,043 29,373 Net revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2006: 30% 10,513 8,812 Non taxable UK dividend income 12,405 11,195 Tax relief on capitalised expenses 2,889 2,923 Unrelieved expenses 4,781 5,306 The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 37,868,000 2006: 33,087,000.
This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is unlikely that this asset will be fully utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments a Management of risk The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments including equity shares which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: Short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and Debentures issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Company's operations.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Company is an investment trust and invests in shares and securities for the long term.
It is the Companys policy that no short term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys operations are market price risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
A description of these risks is given below, together with the Boards policy for managing these risks where appropriate.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss which the Company might incur as a result of holding a portfolio of investments when market prices fall.
The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
An investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through debenture issues and retained profits.
The debentures carry fixed rates of interest and therefore the Company is not exposed to any material cash flow risk arising from interest rate fluctuations.
Credit risk The Companys financial assets are bank balances, debtors and investments, which represent the Companys maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
When buying and selling investments, the Company is exposed to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment or cash.
The Company will only deal with brokers which have been approved by JPMAM and banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Limits have been set as to the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time.
The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties.
