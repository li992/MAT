Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill, which is comprised of several CGUs, had been allocated as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Regional businesses 165,720 15,744 Global businesses 19,588 10,136 185,308 25,880 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the year.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following three years based on an estimated growth rate of 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% is used.
