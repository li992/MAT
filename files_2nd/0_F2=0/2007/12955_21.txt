92 Randgold Resources | Annual Report 2007 6 Changes in accounting policy The company changed its accounting policy on stripping costs, under both IFRS and US GAAP, in 2006.
Previously, costs of production stage waste stripping in excess of the expected pit life average stripping ratio were deferred and then charged to production when the actual stripping ratio was below the expected pit life average stripping ratio.
Under the revised accounting policy, all stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are treated as variable production costs and as a result are included in the cost of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred.
Under US GAAP, EITF 04-06 Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry is effective for reporting periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
The consensus does not permit the deferral of any waste stripping costs during the production phase of a mine, but requires instead that they should be treated as variable production costs.
The directors have decided to adopt the same treatment under IFRS which will ensure that the accounting policies applied under IFRS and US GAAP remain in line.
With regard to the conclusions reached by the EITF, the directors believe the revised policy will mean that the financial statements provide reliable and more relevant information about the groups financial position and its financial performance.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the change in the IFRS policy was applied retrospectively and hence the 2005 figures were restated.
The adjustment reported in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 arising from the change in the IFRS accounting policy is set out below: Group 31 Dec US$000 2006 Decrease in deferred stripping asset 2 115 Decrease in ore stockpiles 6 324 Decrease in gold in process 36 Decrease in deferred taxation liability 740 Increase in deferred taxation asset 2 966 Decrease in opening retained earnings 7 915 Increase in net profit 3 146 Increase in basic earnings per share cents per share 5 Increase in fully diluted earnings per share cents per share 5 Group Company 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec US$000 Notes 2007 2006 2007 2006 7 Receivables Trade 25 405 12 545 - - Advances to contractors 7.1 12 064 12 064 - - Taxation debtor 7.2 19 911 20 322 - - Prepayments 8 606 5 018 1 153 589 Other 77 1 935 64 435 66 063 51 884 1 217 1 024 Impairment provision 1 136 3 183 - - Total 64 927 48 701 1 217 1 024 Less: current portion 42 104 34 999 1 217 1 024 Long term portion 22 823 13 702 - - 7.1 Advances to contractors comprise advances made to a contractor at Loulo, MDM Ferroman Pty Ltd in liquidation MDM.

The provisions for rehabilitation costs include estimates for the effect of inflation and changes in estimates and have been discounted to their present value at 4% 2006: 6% per annum for Morila, being an estimate derived from the risk free rate.
A 4% 2006: 6.5% discount rate was used for Loulo.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali to govern the mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current Life of Mine plans envisage the expected outflow to occur at the end of the Life of Mine, which is 2013 for Morila and 2024 for Loulo.

In order to manage these risks, the group may enter into transactions which make use of on-balance sheet derivatives.
The group does not acquire, hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The group has developed a risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
The board has approved and monitors this risk management process, inclusive of documented treasury policies, counterpart limits, controlling and reporting structures.
CONTROLLING RISK IN THE GROUP The treasury committee is responsible for risk management activities within the group.
The treasury committee reviews and recommends to the board all treasury counterparts, limits, instruments and hedge strategies.
At least two members of the treasury committee need to be present for a decision to be made.
The treasury committee is only permitted to invest with institutions with investment ratings of AAor higher.
The treasurer is responsible for managing investment, gold price, currency, liquidity and credit risk.
The treasury function monitors adherence to the treasury risk management policy and counterpart limits and provides regular reports.
The financial risk management objectives of the group are defined as follows: Safeguarding the group core earnings stream from its major assets through the effective control and management of gold price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Effective and efficient usage of credit facilities in both the short and long term through the adoption of reliable liquidity management planning and procedures.
Ensuring that investment and hedging transactions are undertaken with creditworthy counterparts.
Ensuring that all contracts and agreements related to risk management activities are coordinated, consistent throughout the group and comply where necessary with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.
102 Randgold Resources | Annual Report 2007 20 Financial risk management continued FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily Euro and Communaut Financire Africaine Franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and sells at market spot prices.
Gold sales are disclosed in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a fixed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
At year end, the volume of outstanding forward sale contracts was 207 240 ounces.
NET OPEN HEDGE POSITION AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2007 The group had the following net forward-pricing commitments outstanding against future production.
Summary: All open contracts in the groups commodity hedge position as at 31 December 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total US dollar gold FORWARD SALES Ounces 80 496 84 996 41 748 207 240 Average US$ oz 429.23 434.90 500.38 445.89 The volume of production hedged and the tenor of the hedging book is continually reviewed in the light of changes in operational forecasts, market conditions and the groups hedging policy.
Forward sales contracts require the future delivery of gold at a specified price.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedge derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
During the year to 31 December 2007, a loss of US$0.3 million 2006: US$0.7 million was recognised due to hedge ineffectiveness.
INTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISK Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on financing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
A 1% change in interest rates on the groups net cash cash and cash equivalents less borrowings would result in a US$2.9 million 2006: US$0.9 million impact on profit before tax.
The group typically holds financial investments with an average maturity of 30 days to ensure adequate liquidity.
The maturity of borrowings is set out in note 15, the maturity of all other financial liabilities is not later than one year.

Randgold Resources | Annual Report 2007 103 104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 20 Financial risk management continued CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK The groups derivative financial instruments and cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali.
The gold produced is sold to a reputable gold refinery.
The group is not exposed to significant credit risk, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
Included in receivables is US$18.8 million net of a present value provision 2006: US$18.4 million, see note 7, relating to indirect taxes owing to Morila and Loulo by the State of Mali, which are denominated in FCFA.
Receivables also include advances to a contractor totalling US$12.1 million 2006: US$11.8 million see note 25.
Available-for-sale financial assets consists of a portfolio of AAA rated short term asset-backed securities and other corporate debt instruments.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.

For ounces delivered into hedges the net cash proceeds from the sales will be limited to the forward price per the contract as per the previous table.
However, the revenue recognised under IFRS in respect of forecast sales hedging using forward contracts rolled forward in 2007 will be adjusted to exclude the non-cash profit loss rolled forward.
These profits losses have already been recognised in the income statement, at the original designated delivery date.

The carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of the fair values because of the short maturity of such instruments.
Long term receivables are discounted using the effective interest rate which approximates to a market related rate.
The rates used and the fair values are stated in note 7.
LONG TERM BORROWINGS The fair value of market-based floating rate long term debt is estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.
The fair value for the loans from minority shareholders is based on estimated project cash flows which have been discounted at 6.75% 2006: 6.75%.
GOLD PRICE CONTRACTS The fair value of gold price forward sales contracts has been determined by reference to quoted market rates at year end balance sheet dates.
The forward price of gold is sensitive to fluctuations in the gold spot price, interest rates and the gold lease rate.

24 Non-GAAP information Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non-GAAP measures.
Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute.
The Gold Institute was a non profit industry association comprised of leading gold producers, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers.
This institute has now been incorporated into the National Mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institutes guidance, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping where relevant and royalties.
Under the companys revised accounting policies, there are no transfers to and from deferred stripping.
Total cash costs per ounce are calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces produced for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures or an indicator of our performance.
The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
In particular depreciation, amortisation and share-based payments would be included in a measure of total costs of producing gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a definition for the calculation of total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, Randgold Resources believes that total cash costs per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the companys operations mature, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Randgold Resources | Annual Report 2007 107 108 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 24 Non-GAAP information continued Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties from total cash costs.
Cash operating costs per ounce are calculated by dividing cash operating costs by gold ounces produced for the periods presented.
Gold sales and the average price received are non GAAP measures.
Gold sales represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains losses on hedge contracts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date.
It excludes gains losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales.

25 Significant uncertainties relating to transactions with a contractor The directors believe that the group is entitled to recover US$59.3 million from MDM Ferroman Pty Ltd MDM in liquidation, the contractor which was responsible for construction of the Loulo mine the project until the main construction contract was taken back on 30 December 2005.
This comprises payments totalling US$32 million which have been capitalised as part of the cost of the project, US$15.2 million in respect of damages arising from the delayed completion of the project, and advances of US$12.1 million 2005: US$12.2 million included in receivables.
Of this latter amount, US$7 million is secured by performance bonds and the remainder is secured by various personal guarantees and other assets.
As part of the groups efforts to recoup the monies owed, MDM was put into liquidation on 1 February 2006.
This resulted in a South African Companies Act Section 417 investigation into the business and the financial activities of MDM, its affiliated companies and their directors.
This investigation was concluded in June 2007 and the liquidators are expected to release a statement of MDMs assets and liabilities shortly.
The directors believe that the group will be able to recover in full the US$12.1 million included in receivables.
However, this is dependent on the amounts which can be recovered from the performance bonds, personal guarantees and other assets provided as security.
Any shortfall is expected to be recovered from any free residue accruing to the insolvent estate.
The recovery process has commenced with summons being issued against creditors who received payment from MDM in terms of the Insolvency and Companies Acts and against the insurance company which issued the performance bonds.
The aggregate amount which will ultimately be recovered cannot presently be determined.
The financial statements do not reflect any additional provision that may be required if the US$12.1 million cannot be recovered in full.
Recovery of the other US$47.2 million is dependent on the extent to which the groups claim is accepted by the liquidators and the amount in the free residue.
