Southern Electric Power Distribution plc and the Company have provided guarantees to the Southern Group of the ESPS in respect of the funding required by the scheme.
The Company has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 in relation to financial guarantee contracts.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements.
