Performance 31 Contingent liabilities The Group has entered into various deeds of covenant in respect of certain corporate member subsidiaries to meet each such subsidiarys obligations to Lloyds.
At 31 December 2007, the total guarantee given by the Group under these deeds of covenant subject to limited exceptions amounted to 16.7 million 2006: 382.1 million.
The obligations under the deeds of covenant are secured by a fixed charge over investments of the same value at the relevant valuation date and a floating charge over all the investments and other assets of Amlin Investments Limited, in favour of Lloyds.
Lloyds has the right to retain the income on the charged investments, although it is not expected to exercise this right unless it considers there to be a risk that one or more of the covenants might need to be called and, if called, might not be honoured in full.
In October 2007, the Group transferred 397.5 million of assets from Amlin Investments Limited to Syndicate 2001 Premium Trust Fund.
The charges in favour of Lloyds over these investments were released at that time.
The transfer to Syndicate 2001 Premium Trust Fund was made by way of sale from Amlin Investments Limited to Amlin Corporate Member Limited both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group in its capacity as the corporate member of the Syndicate.
As liability under each deed of covenant is limited to a fixed monetary amount, the enforcement by Lloyds of any deed of covenant in the event of a default by a corporate member, where the total value of investments has fallen below the total of all amounts covenanted, may result in the appropriation of a share of the Groups Funds at Lloyds that is greater than the proportion which that subsidiarys overall premium limit bears to the total overall premium limit of the Groups Lloyds underwriting.
32 Commitments There were no capital commitments at the end of the financial year 2006: nil.
Throughout the year the Group leased certain land and buildings on short-term operating leases, under which the minimum annual commitments were 2.8 million 2006: 2.3 million.
The leases relating to 2.2 million expire in over five years.
