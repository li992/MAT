The British Land Company PLC 99 13 Net debt continued Hedge accounting The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds, caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2007 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is an asset of 88m 2006: 21m liability.
The favourable valuation movement reflects the increase in Sterling interest rates since 31 March 2006.
The cross currency swap, which fully hedges the foreign exchange exposure on the US Private Placement, has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
The market value of this is a liability of 17m 2006: 13m.
The cash flows occur and enter into the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises foreign currency denominated and variable rate debt hedged at 31 March 2007.
