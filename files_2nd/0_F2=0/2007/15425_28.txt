Additional Pro Forma Unaudited Financial Information for Continuing Operations Basis of preparation The Group completed the merger with George Wimpey plc on 3 July 2007.
The statutory results of the Group for the year to 31 December 2007 therefore exclude the first six months trading of the former George Wimpey plc businesses.
To assist investors in understanding the performance of the combined Taylor Wimpey plc Group, a summary pro forma income statement has been prepared by aggregating the underlying financial information for the year to 31 December 2007 of the former Taylor Woodrow plc TW and the former George Wimpey Plc GW, to illustrate the effect of the merger of TW and GW as if the transaction had taken place on 1 January 2006.
The results from the two legacy businesses have been prepared on the basis of their historic accounting policies as published in the 2006 financial statements of the two Groups.
In aggregating the two sets of financial information, intra-Group trading between the two entities has not been eliminated and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition accounting have been excluded.
This information has not been audited.
