The Group does not have any internally generated intangible assets.
i During 2006, the Group reassessed the value of its purchased patent technology and concluded that, following advances in the Groups similar in-house technologies, that there will be insufficient sales of products using this particular technology to support its value.
Estimated future cash flows for the patent over the next five years were discounted at a risk adjusted discount rate of 12% which resulted in a net present value less than the carrying value.
Therefore an impairment was charged to the profit and loss account within the Foodservice North America segment in 2006. b Capital commitments: 2007 2006 m m Contracted commitments for future expenditure on intangible assets 0.8 0.5 90 | Enodis plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements
