The charge consists mainly of external legal and professional advisers fees of 3,370,000 2006: 3,398,000.
Additionally 4,664,000 was charged directly to equity in respect of the IPO for listing fees, underwriting fees and other professional advisers fees directly associated with the raising of capital.
Upon the successful listing of Xchanging on the London Stock Exchange, the CEO, David Andrews, gave every qualifying Xchanging employee 200 of his own personal Xchanging shares.
This gift falls within the scope of IFRS 2 and consequently the Group incurs an accounting charge of 1,969,000 equivalent to the value of the shares at the date of the gift.
In addition, social security costs of 236,000 were incurred.
In 2006, costs were incurred in migrating customers from a discontinued insurance software platform, Riskwrite, to a superior platform acquired as part of the RebusIS acquisition in 2004.
The finance cost element relates to adjustments that were made to existing onerous lease provisions due to the change in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these provisions.
This change in discount rate is a direct result of the IPO.

Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year The tax for the period is higher than 2006: the same as the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2007 2006 000 000 Profit before tax 32,471 24,920 Profit before tax multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30% 9,741 7,476 Changes in tax rates 1,402 Taxable overseas dividend income 243 1,110 Overseas losses not available for group relief 41 827 Utilisation of tax losses 357 2,069 Depreciation for the year in excess of capital allowances 181 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1,949 2,055 Short-term temporary differences 688 Tax in respect of prior years 967 390 Difference on foreign tax rates 145 447 Share option deduction 579 Withholding tax written off 39 Tax charge for the year 11,946 7,476 During the year, as a result of the change in UK corporation tax rates which will be effective from 1 April 2008 and the German tax reform changes effective from 1 January 2008, deferred tax balances have been remeasured.
UK deferred tax relating to temporary differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April 2008 is measured at 30% and UK deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2008 is measured at the tax rate of 28% as these are the tax rates that will apply on reversal.
German deferred tax balances are measured at the expected effective tax rate of 31-32%.
Factors that may affect future tax charges Tax losses arising in previous years and other temporary differences total an estimated carried forward amount of 17,946,000 2006: 18,967,000 which, assuming a tax rate of 28%, gives rise to an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 5,025,000 2006: 5,690,000 using a rate of 30%.
As the respective Group undertaking in which these tax losses arise becomes profitable, future tax charges will be reduced as these tax losses are offset against the profits made.
However, no asset in relation to this has been recognised as there is insufficient certainty over the timing and availability of such future profits.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 75 XCHANGING PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of Xchanging plc and, for periods prior to 30 April 2007, the weighted average number of Xchanging BV shares as converted into Xchanging plc shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has three types of potential dilutive ordinary shares: share options, convertible debt and warrants.
Prior to listing on the London Stock Exchange, the warrants were exercised and the debt was converted into ordinary shares.

A dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 of 2.0 pence per share, amounting to a total dividend of 4,296,000, is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2008.
These financial statements do not reflect this proposed dividend payable.
There are no material tax consequences of this dividend.

This resulted in an increase to goodwill of 604,000.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to Enterprise Partnership and business sector.
The carrying amounts of goodwill by division are as follows: Insurance Financial Markets Business Lines Total 000 000 000 000 Xchanging Procurement Services 44,319 44,319 HR Enterprise 9,808 9,808 Ins-sure Holdings 3,942 3,942 RebusIS 8,460 8,460 16,920 Xtb GmbH 270 270 Fondsdepot Bank GmbH 1,527 1,527 Landmark Business Consulting 4,214 4,214 Ferguson Snell and Associates 4,591 4,591 Xchanging Broking Services 29 29 16,645 1,797 67,178 85,620 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on budgets approved by the Directors covering a three year period, which incorporate growth rates specific to each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated to year five using a nil growth rate: a terminal value using nil growth is then added.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12.35% is then applied to the projections, based on managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 81 XCHANGING PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 20 Trade and other receivables continued As at 31 December 2007, trade receivables of 30,450,000 2006: 16,006,000 were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
All trade receivables whether current or past due are reviewed for impairment on a case-by-case basis to identify impairment taking into account the ageing of the debt, the likelihood of recoverability and other external factors.
The ageing analysis of the trade receivables is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Current 17,334 20,293 Past due: 1 30 days 22,100 8,416 31 60 days 4,291 2,669 61 90 days 1,672 2,458 Over 90 days 2,387 2,463 Net trade receivables 47,784 36,299 Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 At 1 January 1,003 1,010 Acquired in the year 2 Charged credited to the income statement: provided in the year 675 485 released in the year 191 294 Used in the year 451 183 Exchange adjustments 5 17 At 31 December 1,031 1,003 The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
21 Cash and cash equivalents 2007 2006 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 98,366 58,684 The cash reflected on the Groups balance sheet not only includes cash immediately accessible for operations but also includes cash held within the Enterprise Partnerships, which is paid to the Group on an annual, or in some cases quarterly, basis as contractual dividends and licence fees.
Therefore, cash available for the Groups 100% owned operations is dependent on the periodic distributions from the Enterprise Partnerships, all of whom have a 100% distribution policy.
In 2006, included within cash at bank and in hand was 5,000,000 cash held in respect of collateralisation for a letter of credit provided for the Xtb acquisition.
This letter of credit was provided by Lloyds TSB for three years from signing the contract and underwrote the savings guarantees made by Xchanging to Deutsche Bank in respect of this acquisition.
Upon failure to deliver the guaranteed savings, Deutsche Bank could call for an amount of up to 15 million.
The letter of credit expired on 30 June 2007 and hence there are no equivalent restrictions on cash at 31 December 2007.

The amount of contingent consideration estimated as probable has been discounted using the effective interest rate at the time of acquisition, being the market rate of 5.75%.
The remainder of the balance, 515,000, relates to the acquisition of Fondsdepot Bank GmbH.
This amount is not contingent, and is payable in cash within one year.
In January 2004, a Sterling convertible loan note was issued to Rebus Insurance Services Holdings Limited, and was subsequently transferred to General Atlantic LLC, on the acquisition of the RebusIS group.
The face value of the loan note was 15 million on its maturity date of 28 January 2009 and was recorded in the balance sheet at its fair value, having been discounted at the market rate of 6.95% on the date of issue.
Before maturity the loan note could be converted into convertible preference shares in Xchanging BV at a price of 11 per share and was secured over such shares.
The loan note was not interest bearing.
In April 2007, the loan was converted into 1,363,636 convertible preference class E shares in Xchanging BV.
The equity element recognised on inception was transferred to the share premium reserve on conversion.
The Group has minority shareholders in three Enterprise Partnerships that hold the right to sell their shares to the Group at a future date.
In accordance with IAS 32, the cash flows associated with these options are fair valued and discounted back to their present value.

The operational risk provision comprises an estimated liability in respect of identified operating errors which had occurred in the ordinary course of business in the Financial Markets sector up to 31 December 2007.
The early and part-time retirement provision arises from a statutory requirement for German businesses and is calculated under IAS 19 with reference to actuarial reports.
Employees within Xtb receive long service payment awards for 10 years or more of service.

The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
For comparative purposes, all share prices reflected below are stated on an Xchanging plc equivalent basis.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: General assumptions Vesting period years 3 Option life years 10 Expected life years 3.25 Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield % 0 1 Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting % 20 Risk free interest rate % 3.9 4.5 2007 2006 Share price at grant date pence 132.50 277.00 93.75 132.50 Weighted average exercise price pence approved options 135.07 93.41 unapproved options 146.32 115.28 Weighted average fair value of options granted in the period pence approved options 30.57 22.29 unapproved options 33.04 21.48 Expected volatility % 24 26 26 30 There were no grants of options over G shares during 2007 and 2006.

The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
A reconciliation of option movements over the year to 31 December 2007 is in note 26.
The weighted average share price during the year for options exercised over the year was 2.86 per share 2006: 0.99.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payments under the share option plans was 622,000 2006: 495,000, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
106,000 of the 2007 charge has been classified as exceptional as it related to accelerated charges due to early exercises as a result of the IPO.
ii Share Purchase Plan 2007 SPP The Group adopted the SPP during 2007, in which Executive Directors and certain members of senior management were invited to participate.
Under this scheme, set up in February 2007, an employee benefit trust loaned money to the participants in order to allow them to purchase class F shares in Xchanging BV at the market value at the time of 5.30 Xchanging plc equivalent value 1.33.
These loans are non-interest bearing and the terms and conditions are described further in note 39.
Participants may not normally sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares awarded under the scheme for a period of 18 months from issue.
As the shares were granted at the fair market value at the time there was no share-based payment charge as a result of this scheme.
The share awards are subject to continued employment for a period of 18 months from the date of grant although the employee benefit trust may repurchase any shares awarded at the current market value for good leavers.

Fondsdepot Bank GmbH specialises in fund administration and provides the Group with an entry point into this market.
Details of net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows: Fair value 000 Purchase consideration: cash 9,688 contingent consideration based on the Phoenix provision see below 1,281 put option liability 9,483 costs of acquisition 467 Total purchase consideration 18,357 Fair value of net assets acquired 16,912 Goodwill note 15 1,445 The Phoenix provision relates to future payments which Fondsdepot Bank GmbH has to make to the EdW, a federal special fund aimed at protecting investors, as a result of a securities fraud committed by one of the EdW member companies.
The sale and purchase agreement contains a clause stipulating that Fondsdepot Bank GmbHs liability regarding the payments to the EdW is capped at 2,080,000.
All other payments will be reimbursed by Allianz Global Investors.
These repayments are considered to be a deferred adjustment to the purchase price and are included within trade and other receivables.
The contingent consideration has been discounted using the effective interest rate at the time of acquisition, being a market rate of 5.5% and is based on the Groups estimate of the extent of the repayment from Allianz Global Investors in respect of the Phoenix matter.
The purchase agreement contains a put option for Allianz Global Investors to sell their shareholding in Fondsdepot Bank GmbH to the Group for a pre determined fixed amount of 9,483,000 at any time after the fourth anniversary of the contract.
The fair value of this put option liability is included in the purchase consideration.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 95 XCHANGING PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 36 Business combinations continued Due to the recent closure of the acquisition, the fair values of significant assets and liabilities are provisional and will be finalised within the next 12 months.
The book and estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities as at 1 November 2007 are set out below: Acquirees carrying amount Fair value 000 000 Intangible assets note 16 9,602 9,602 Property, plant and equipment note 17 646 646 Deferred income tax assets 1,055 Held-for-trading financial assets 267 267 Trade and other receivables 5,728 5,728 Cash 8,498 8,498 Current tax receivables 121 121 Retirement benefit obligation 803 1,060 Trade and other payables 3,625 3,625 Provisions 524 3,720 Deferred income tax liabilities 600 600 Net assets acquired 19,310 16,912 The acquired business contributed revenues of 7,660,000 and a net loss after tax of 117,000 to the Group during 2007.
If the above business combination had been made at the beginning of 2007, total Group revenue would have been 503,706,000 and net profit would have been 14,950,000.
These amounts have been calculated using the Groups accounting policies and including any finance charges that would have arisen on the put option assuming this was a liability from 1 January 2007, together with the consequential tax effects.
37 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension plans for its qualifying employees.
The principal plans are three defined benefit schemes in the UK and two defined benefit schemes in Germany.
With the exception of one scheme in Germany, the defined benefit schemes are funded and assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
For the Fondsdepot Bank scheme, there is no separate Contractual Trust Agreement and so there are no assets which can be separately identified as specifically relating to this pension scheme.
The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit schemes and operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
i Defined benefit schemes The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK and Germany which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS19 in order to assess the funding position of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
Financial assumptions The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions are as follows: 2007 2006 UK Germany UK Germany %% %% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.10 2.50 3.80 2.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment RPI up to 5% 3.00 n a 2.75 n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment fixed 5% 5.00 n a 5.00 n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment RPI up to 2.5% 2.10 n a 1.95 n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment n a 2.00 n a 2.00 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.10 2.00 2.80 2.00 Discount rate 5.90 5.50 5.10 4.60 Inflation assumption 3.10 2.00 2.80 2.00 Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December n a 5.00 n a 5.00 equities 8.00 n a 8.00 n a gilts 4.50 n a 4.50 n a bonds 5.90 n a 5.10 n a Expected return on plan assets 5.50 6.58 5.00 6.19 6.76 5.00 96 Notes to the consolidated financial statements ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 37 Retirement benefit obligations continued To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the portfolio.
The post-retirement mortality tables used for the schemes are based on country specific mortality tables, namely the PA 00 series in the UK based on year of birth with a scaling factor of 130% and with allowance for medium cohort improvements and Richtaffeln 2005 G, Heubeck-Richtaffeln GmbH, Kln 2005 in Germany.

The actuarial valuations for two of the Groups UK defined benefit schemes are currently in progress and future contribution requirements to these schemes are due to be agreed some time in 2008. ii BAE Systems defined benefit schemes The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit schemes run for the employees of BAE Systems.
The terms on which the Group participates in these schemes were set in commercial agreements reached with BAE Systems during 2006.
Under the terms of these agreements, the contributions payable by the Group represent the cost of accrual of future service benefits and the Groups share of the deficit contributions made by BAE Systems to the schemes only not including any one-off contributions made by BAE Systems during 2006.
The contributions are expressed as fixed percentages of pensionable payroll.
The Groups contribution rates to the schemes are contractually fixed and will only be affected by changes to the cost of accrual of future service benefits, as determined at the triennial valuations of the schemes.
The Groups contribution rates are not affected by any future changes in the past service position of the schemes, relating to past service of its own employees or other members of the scheme.
