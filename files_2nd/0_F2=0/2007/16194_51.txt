Provisions i Decommissioning costs 2007 2006 000 000 At 1 January 124,868 91,139 Acquisition of subsidiary note 26 5,463 New provisions and changes in estimates 7,252 24,199 Assets held for sale note 18 1,527 Decommissioning payments 5,065 257 Unwinding of discount note 5 8,609 6,771 Currency translation adjustment 525 2,447 At 31 December 133,612 124,868 The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, African and Asian oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2025.
These provisions have been created based on Tullows internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
