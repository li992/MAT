DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Currency derivatives The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements.
Although these contracts act as an economic hedge they are not designated in a hedge relationship for hedge accounting purposes.
Gains or losses are consequently taken directly to the income statement.
At 31 December 2007, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is 61.0m 2006 69.4m.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives amounting to a 2.2m profit 2006 1.7m have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
Interest rate swaps and caps The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its principal bank and other borrowings.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2007 was 95.9m 2006 79.5m.
Swap contracts with notional values of 35.2m 2006 35.7m have fixed interest receipts at an average rate of 7.047% 2006 7.047% and floating interest payments at an average rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 2.857% 2006 6 month LIBOR plus 2.857% up to 2012.
At 31 December 2007 the fixed interest receivable rates vary from 6.61% to 7.375% 2006 6.61% to 7.375% and floating interest payable rates vary from 7.968% to 8.458% 2006 8.2% to 8.7%.
Further swap contracts, with notional values at 31 December 2007 of 25.1m 2006 5.1m have fixed interest payments of 4.914% 2006 4.2% and floating interest receipts of 5.391% 2006 5.63% until 2009.
On maturity of two of the swap contracts in 2009, the counterparties have the option to extend the swaps for a further three-and-a-half years for a notional US$40m, of which US$20m is at 5.085% and US$20m is at 5.1%.
Cap contracts with notional values of 35.6m 2006 38.7m have interest rates capped at the average rate of 4.457% 2006 3.94%.
On maturity of one of the cap contracts the counterparty has the option to enter into an interest rate swap for four years for a notional US$30m at 4.2% 2006 US$30m at 4.2% if the four year interest rate swap rate is below 4.2% 2006 4.2%.
Fixed to floating interest rate swaps are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.
The movement in the fair value of these contracts is dealt with in the income statement.
The borrowings that are hedged by these swaps are measured at amortised cost and adjusted for the fair value of the hedged risk, with the movement in fair value dealt with in the income statement and set-off against the movement in the fair value of these swaps.
The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 0.1m 2006 nil as shown in note 7.
Interest of 0.5m 2006 0.4m was paid on the interest rate swaps designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
