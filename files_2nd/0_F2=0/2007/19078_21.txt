Accounting policies Basis of preparation Minerva plc is a limited liability company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures.
The Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
The following standards and interpretations, although effective for the year ended 30 June 2007, do not have an impact on or are not relevant to the Group: IFRS 1, Amendment, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: IFRS 6, Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources: IAS 19, Amendment, Employee benefits Actuarial gains and losses, group plans and disclosure: IAS 21, Amendment, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates: IAS 39, Amendment, Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intra-group transactions: IAS 39, Amendment, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement the fair value option: IAS 39, Amendment, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement and IFRS 4 Insurance contracts: IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease: IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds: IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment: IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, financial reporting in hyper-inflationary economies: IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2: and IFRIC 9, Re-assessment of embedded derivatives.
The following new standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group: IFRS 7, Financial instruments: disclosure: IFRS 8, Operating segments: IAS 1, Amendment, Presentation of financial statements capital disclosures: IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment: IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions: and IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements.
Following an initial review it is not anticipated that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material financial impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application.
The exception to this is anticipated to be IFRS 7 and IAS 1, where additional presentation and disclosure is expected to be required.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements.
Measurement convention 60 The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed Minerva plc IFRS, IFRIC interpretations, the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and Annual report and the historical cost convention as modified by the inclusion of investment properties and financial instruments accounts 2007 at fair value.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may impact on the Groups earnings and financial position include: valuation of investment properties, where the Board has relied upon external valuations carried out by professionally qualified valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: valuation of derivative financial instruments, where the Board has relied upon the valuation carried out by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, finance risk consultants: recognition of a share-based payment charge, where the Board has relied upon actuarial estimates produced by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP: 1.
Accounting policies continued distinction between investment properties and owner occupied property, where the Board considers owner occupied property to be held for use in the supply of services and for administration purposes by the Group: and calculation of deferred tax, where indexation is used to reduce the provision for deferred tax on revaluation surpluses.
Other areas of judgement, risk and uncertainty, which are relevant to an understanding of the financial results and position of the Group, are referred to in the Business review.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Group includes the financial results of subsidiaries acquired during the year from the effective date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control.
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control, whereas an associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but not control over financial and operating policies.
In accordance with IAS 31, the Group equity accounts for its share of net result after tax of joint ventures and associates, together with its share of fair value adjustments, through the income statement and recognises its share of the net assets of the joint ventures and associates in the consolidated balance sheet.
To the extent that fair value adjustments are in respect of cash flow hedges, these movements are recognised directly in equity.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company balance sheet at cost and reviewed for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue comprises rental income from operating leases, service charge income and other amounts receivable from tenants.
Rental income and lease incentives to tenants are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Property expenses Refurbishment expenditure in respect of major works is capitalised.
Renovation and refurbishment expenditure of a revenue nature is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Costs directly attributable to the arrangement of a lease, which include letting and professional fees, are capitalised and amortised over the lease term.
Investment properties Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transactions costs, and subsequently at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of an investment property at the balance sheet date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement, are recorded in the income statement.
Financial statements Additions to properties in the course of development or refurbishment include the cost of finance and directly attributable internal and external costs incurred during the period of development until practical completion.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassified.
61 Trading properties Trading properties are included in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Minerva plc Properties reclassified as trading properties are transferred at deemed cost, being the carrying amount Annual report and accounts 2007 at the date of reclassification.
Property transactions Purchases and sales are recognised on exchange of contracts provided that, if the exchange is conditional, all material conditions have been satisfied.
Property, plant and equipment This category comprises owner occupied property, motor vehicles and fixtures and fittings.
These assets are stated at historical cost, or in the case of owner occupied property its carrying value at the date of transfer, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment.
Owner occupied property is depreciated over 50 years and motor vehicles and fixtures and fittings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
Leases the Group as a lessor Properties leased out under operating leases are included in investment or trading properties, with lease income being recognised over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Leases the Group as a lessee Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are stated in the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments.
Borrowings Bank loans are included in the financial statements, initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, which are amortised over the life of the loan.
Bank loans are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps and swaptions in order to manage the risks arising from its activities.
Derivatives are recorded at fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate.
Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate derivatives are recognised in the period to which they relate.
The Group applies hedge accounting to its interest rate swaps where they meet the relevant criteria and represent a cash flow hedge.
Changes in fair value of such derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges are recognised directly in reserves, to be transferred to the income statement in the period during which the hedge item is recognised in the income statement.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement as a finance cost and in all other cases movements in the fair value of interest rate derivatives are taken to the income statement.
Income tax The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-taxable or disallowed having taking into consideration capital allowances, indexation and available tax losses.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is calculated on the basis that properties will be realised predominantly through sale and therefore capital gains are reduced by indexation.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax is determined using rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value less provision for impairment where it is established there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the provision is 62 the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The provision is recorded in the income statement.
Minerva plc Annual report and Trade and other payables accounts 2007 Trade and other payables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
Share-based payment The Group provides share-based payment in the form of share options and share award plans.
These plans are discussed in greater detail in the Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 45.
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that have not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised in the financial statements.
The Group uses, where appropriate, either a modified binomial or a Monte Carlo valuation model and the resulting fair values, calculated at each award date, are expensed through the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
The Group revises its estimate of the number of employees expected to remain in service to each vesting date and of the expected satisfaction of any other non-market performance conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to the original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Accounting policies continued Retirement benefits Employer contributions to schemes of employees are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.

The main assumptions of the pricing model are as follows: 2005 Executive 2001 Sharesave 2001 Sharesave Incentive Plan Scheme Scheme Grant date 13 November 2006 19 December 2006 19 December 2006 Exercise price 383.75p 386.75p 386.75p Expected life years 3 3 5 Expected volatility per annum 29% 27% 30% Expected dividend yield per annum 0% 0% 0% Risk free rate per annum 4.9% 5.1% 4.9% Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Minerva plc share price over a period consistent with expected life of the award and reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, but may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The 2005 Executive Incentive Plan has a performance condition based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR measured against a Comparator Group of companies.
This is a market condition for the purpose of IFRS 2 and, as such, it is allowed for in the calculation of the fair value.
The assumptions used were based on an analysis of the historic volatility of each comparator companys share price return as well as the statistical correlations between the historic TSRs of the different shares.
Financial statements For both the Discretionary Share Option Scheme and Sharesave Scheme awards, the fair values take into account an assumed pattern of early exercise, dependent on the level of share prices during the exercise period.
