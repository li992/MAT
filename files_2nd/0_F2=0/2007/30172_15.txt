An analysis of borrowings by maturity has been disclosed in note 25.
Loan notes Guaranteed unsecured loan notes were issued by Tullett Prebon Group Holdings plc formerly Collins Stewart Tullett plc in March 2003, of which 0.1m were outstanding at the year end 2006: 0.1m.
The loan notes are redeemable in April 2008 or earlier at the holders request.
Interest is payable half yearly in arrears at a rate of 1% below LIBOR.
150m Eurobond In August 2004 150m 8.25% Step-Up Coupon Subordinated Notes due 12 August 2014 were issued.
The notes, which are unsecured, are callable by Tullett Prebon Group Holdings plc formerly Collins Stewart Tullett plc at any time after 12 August 2009 the Call Date.
After the Call Date the notes will bear interest calculated at 3.5% over the gross redemption yield of a gilt with a comparable maturity date.
The fair value of 64.2m 2006: 64.2m of the 150m Eurobond is hedged by the cross currency interest rate swap.
At 31 December 2007, the hedge reduced the liability by 0.2m 2006: 0.3m decrease and together with the unamortised transaction costs resulted in a fair value of the debt of 149.2m 2006: 148.7m.
The fair value of the entire Eurobond is 151.8m 2006: 151.4m.

Interest bearing loans and borrowings continued Bank loan On 30 January 2007 a new 350m credit facility agreement was entered into in advance of the return of capital.
The five-year facility consists of a 300m amortising term loan and a 50m committed revolving credit facility that is repayable at the end of year five.
The 300m term loan was drawn on 19 March 2007.
The revolving credit facility was not drawn throughout the year and remained undrawn at 31 December 2007.
The average effective interest rate on the bank loan was 7.0% during 2007.
As at 31 December 2007 the carrying value of the loan approximates to the fair value.
Derivative financial instruments Cross currency interest rate swap In August 2004, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap whereby it receives a fixed rate of interest of 8.25% and pays a variable interest rate equal to US LIBOR plus 2.69%.
The notional amount of the swap is 64.2m with an exchange of principal of US$117m.
The maturity date of the swap is August 2009.
The counterparty to the swap is a financial institution with a credit rating of AA at 31 December 2007.
The swap has been designated and is effective as a fair value hedge of 64.2m of the 150m Eurobond and as a net investment hedge of US$117m of dollar denominated net assets.
Fair value gains or losses on the effective portion of the net investment hedge are included in equity.
The gain recognised in 2007 was 1.0m 2006: gain of 8.4m.
At 31 December 2007 the fair value of the swap was 7.2m 2006: 5.8m.
The fair value is based on broker quotes which are validated by discounting estimated future cash flows using market interest rates for similar instruments at the year end.
Equity swap In 2004 the Trustees of the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trust entered into an equity swap to hedge market risk on the future purchase of own shares to satisfy the vesting of awards under share option schemes.
During the year, the swap was settled with the Trust purchasing 3.228m shares for a net consideration of 11.3m.
These shares are included as part of own shares in equity.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the equity swap was 9.8m, and collateral held in respect of the equity swap included in other debtors was 3.5m.
The counterparty to the equity swap was a financial institution with a credit rating of A.

Where available, external credit ratings and or reports on customers and other counterparties are obtained and used.
The Groups policy is to deal only with counterparties of high creditworthiness and the majority are financial institutions.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
None of the Groups financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk to a single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
Matched principal brokerage transactions, whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and sold to another counterparty, are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
The above analysis reflects only the receivable side of such transactions, the other side being shown in trade and other payables.
Settlement of such transactions typically takes place within a few business days according to the relevant market rules and conventions and the settlement risk is considered to be minimal.
The above analysis should be read in conjunction with the information on credit risk management included in the Groups Business Review on page 11.

The change in equity represents the sensitivity of the cross currency interest rate swap to movements in the US dollar.
Movements in the cross currency interest rate swap due to changes in exchange rates would be offset by similar movements in the retranslation of the Groups US dollar net investment under the net investment hedge explained in note 21.
The retranslation of net investment in foreign currencies is excluded from the following table.
Based on a 5.0% weakening in the US dollar and Euro exchange rates against sterling, the effect on profit for the year and equity would be as follows: 2007 2006 USD EUR USD EUR m m m m Change in profit for the year 3.0 0.8 2.0 0.9 Change in equity 3.1 3.3 The Group would experience an equal and opposite foreign exchange gain should sterling weaken against the US dollar and Euro.

Financial instruments continued e Interest rate sensitivity analysis Interest on floating rate financial instruments is reset at intervals of less than one year.
The Groups exposure to interest rates arises on cash and cash equivalents, money market instruments, the cross currency interest rate swap, bank overdrafts, loan notes and the bank loan.
The Eurobond and the obligations under finance leases are fixed rate financial instruments.

Share-based payments The Group has a number of equity-based long term incentive plans for the granting of non-transferable options to certain employees and executives.
Options granted under these plans, once vested, typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria, all of which are non-market conditions.
The maximum life of the options is ten years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised, using shares held by an Employee Share Ownership Trust for this purpose.
On 15 March 2007, Tullett Prebon plc returned 301.5m of capital to its shareholders 142p per ordinary share.
A consequence of the return of capital was a corresponding reduction in the Companys share price.
In order to preserve the economic value of share options outstanding at the time, the number of shares over which options were held was increased by a factor equivalent to the average Tullett Prebon plc share price for the three trading days immediately prior to the return of capital, divided by the average Tullett Prebon plc share price for the three trading days immediately following the return of capital a ratio of 1.31628:1.
The change in the number of shares represents a modification to preserve the economic value of the share option plans and therefore there has been no alteration to the cost of the plans.
The Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 the Trust was established on 30 October 2007 as an employees share scheme to provide equity incentivisation to certain employees within the Group.
The Trust holds 630,680 shares in Tullett Prebon plc, for the benefit of certain employees of the Group, to whom share awards were made in November 2007.
The shares held by the Trust will be transferred to these employees in November 2010, subject to the terms of the awards being fulfilled.

The estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, expected life of the option until exercise and a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity profile.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 was calculated based on the share price at grant date, adjusted for the non-accumulation of dividends.

The consideration was US$95.0m 48.5m payable in cash, US$57.0m 29.1m of which was paid on completion, the balance being payable over the next three years, subject to certain performance requirements.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition was US$89.4m 44.9m at 31 December 2007.

The revenue and profit for the period, had Chapdelaine been acquired on 1 January 2007 is not considered to be materially different to the Groups reported profit for the period.
Yamane Prebon Co. Limited subsequently renamed Yamane Tullett Prebon Japan Limited With effect from 28 December 2007, the Group restructured its joint arrangement with Central Tanshi Co. Limited, and entered into a new joint agreement on managing Yamane Prebon Co. Limited YP.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world, all of which, with the three exceptions identified below, are defined contribution schemes.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based policies of insurance, except for those held in North America to match the liabilities of a supplemental executive retirement plan SERP C. The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the UK and in North America: i The Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme Defined Benefit Section is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
The Principal Employer of the scheme is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members in 1991 and since May 2003 future accrual on a defined benefit basis has ceased.
Members in service in 1991 receive benefits on the better of a money purchase underpin and defined benefit basis.
For defined benefit section members in service in May 2003 there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
ii The Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members in 1989 and since April 2006 future accrual on a defined benefit basis has ceased.
Members receive benefits on the better of a money purchase underpin and defined benefit basis.
For members in service in April 2006 there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
iii The Prebon Yamane US SERP C plan provides participants in North America with retirement benefits for 10 or 15 years at a specified dollar amount.
The entitlement of the participants to the plan benefits vests over time in accordance with length of service, up to a maximum period of 10 years.
SERP C was introduced in 1992 and the last participant was admitted in 1999.
The previous plan, SERP B, provided participants with a target retirement benefit, but all investment gains and losses are borne by the participant and plan B is therefore treated as a defined contribution scheme.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the UK defined benefit schemes during 2008 is 2.7m.
The latest actuarial valuations of the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme and of the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme together, the UK defined benefit schemes were carried out as at 30 April 2004 and 1 January 2004 respectively by independent qualified actuaries.
In both cases the present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the vested liabilities under the Prebon Yamane US SERP C are recalculated monthly using an appropriate discount rate and the necessary additional accrual or release of accrual is made in the accounts of the relevant subsidiary undertaking as a pension cost.
As at 31 December 2007 the SERP C liability included in the balance sheet was 1.0m 2006: 1.3m.
In order to cover this liability the Group holds policies of insurance with a cash surrender value as at 31 December 2007 of 1.1m 2006: 1.9m.
64 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2007 34.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries of the UK defined benefit schemes to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2007 2006 %% Key assumptions used: Discount rate 5.80 5.10 Expected return on schemes assets 7.25 7.05 Expected rate of salary increases 4.65 4.35 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 3.40 3.10 Inflation assumption 3.40 3.10 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive fixed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2004 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in future at age 60 will live on average for a further 28 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years after retirement if they are female.
For the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme the equivalent assumptions are 24 years for males and 27 years for females.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a consistent but generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
These assumptions are being reviewed as part of the 2007 triennial actuarial valuations.
