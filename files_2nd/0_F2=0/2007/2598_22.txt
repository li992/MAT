These provisions cover the relevant period of the lease agreements, up to the earliest possible termination date, which typically extend from one to 10 years.
The Group has provisions for expected legal, environmental and other claims based on managements best estimate of probable loss incurred at the balance sheet date.
It expects that these amounts, which are based on detailed plans or other known factors and take account of past experience for similar items, will be settled within the next one to five years.
The Group is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations.
While any litigation has an element of uncertainty, management does not expect that the outcome of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.

No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the parent company ultimately controls the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, as such, is able to control the timing of the reversal of any associated temporary differences.
The Company has determined that either the overseas profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries, it is not expected that such distributions will give rise to a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of 8.2m 2006: nil.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 81.1m 2006: 95.8m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be set.
