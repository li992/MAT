The amendment to IAS 1 Financial statement presentation released in September 3 This represents segment revenue: the Groups share of associates revenue figures are provided for 2007 redefines the primary statements and expands on certain disclosures within additional information.

Total Group revenue including share of revenue from associates and revenue from discontinued operations is $35,674 million 2006: $38,637 million IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions clarifies that the manner in which an being $30,559 million 2006: $29,404 million from continuing operations and entity obtains the shares to satisfy its obligations in terms of a share-based payment $5,115 million 2006: $9,233 million from discontinued operations.
See note 33 transaction does not influence the classification of that transaction as equity settled for summarised segmental disclosures relating to discontinued operations.
In addition, where an entity satisfies a share-based payment by issue of its parents shares rather than the parent making the share-based payment directly the interpretation requires that these be treated as cash settled rather than equity settled.
From the Group perspective this is not expected to have a material impact.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding requirements and their Interaction clarifies when refunds and reductions in future contributions would be regarded as available in determining the appropriate defined benefit asset to be recognised under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
It further clarifies the impact of minimum funding requirements.
This is not expected to have a material impact for the Group.

On 18 July 2007, the Group completed its acquisition of a 49% interest in the MMX Minas-Rio integrated iron ore project in Brazil Minas-Rio.
The acquisition was effected through the purchase of a 30% interest in the project companies MMX Minas-Rio Minerao SA and LLX Minas-Rio Logstica SA from Centennial Asset Mining Fund LLC and the subscription for shares in the project companies equivalent to a 19% interest.
The total acquisition cost of $1.2 billion comprises $1.15 billion plus transaction costs and provision for post closing adjustments.

Payment of this amount was considered possible at 31 December 2007.

Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
For those share schemes which do not include non-market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo method at the grant date and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the date of grant.
For all share schemes with non-market related vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the associated charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
The Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings.
Equity settled share-based payments that are made to employees of the Companys subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Companys investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Accounting for share-based payments is the same as under IFRS 2 and details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included in the Company financial statements are set out in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2007.
