At financial close, Atkins received 20.1m in respect of bid cost recoveries and project development fees from Metronet.
In line with the Groups accounting policy in relation to pre-contract costs incurred on PPP PFI investments, this sum was recognised on the balance sheet and will be released to the income statement over 30 years.
Atkins is required to invest 70m in Metronet by way of equity and shareholder subordinated debt over the first six years of the concession.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Group invested 18.0m 2006: 11.2m.
The outstanding investment required is 19.3m 2006: 37.3m of which 15.6m was paid post year-end.
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 PAGE SIXTY-SIX NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The contract Metronet has two separate 30-year performance-based contracts which together cover over two-thirds of the London Underground 1 network.
The contracts, which are split into four 7 2-year periods, cover inter alia the repair, refurbishment and modernisation of the 1 infrastructure.
The contracts are subject to periodic review at the end of each 7 2-year period.
The periodic reviews allow for restating the scope of the work, the level of payment, the contractual terms and the performance requirements.
Metronet has contracted with Trans4m Ltd, a Joint Venture company in which Atkins has a 25% shareholding, to undertake the civil 1 engineering work and the refurbishment programme.
Trans4m Ltd has signed a 7 2-year contract with Atkins for premises and civil design, inspection and assessment work and the design and build of new communication systems.
Metronets revenue consists of a fixed element Underlying Infrastructure Service Charge which is adjusted for performance.
Performance is measured under three categories: capability, availability and ambience.
Shareholder returns are sensitive to these performance-based measures.
Consolidation of Metronets results In line with the Groups accounting policies on Joint Ventures, the results of Metronet have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
As part of its consolidation of Metronets balance sheet, Atkins initially recognised 8.7m of goodwill associated with liabilities inherited when the PPP companies were acquired from London Underground Limited.
Under the transition rules for the implementation of IFRS this balance was frozen at the carrying amount on 1 April 2004 of 7.8m and will be subject to an annual impairment review.
The carrying value of the Groups investment in Metronet has been fully impaired in the current year see note 9.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Metronet Joint Venture During the year Metronets operating performance was mixed and the stations and certain other capital programmes remain behind schedule.
The costs of the programme are substantially higher than anticipated and as a result on 21 June 2007 Metronet gave notice to London Underground of its intention to invite the Arbiter to conduct an Extraordinary Review for Metronet BCV in July and for Metronet SSL later in the year.
The Arbiters review will determine the extent to which the additional costs in excess of the first 50m per infraco qualify for reimbursement by London Underground and is likely to take at least six to nine months to conduct.
There is a risk that some of the additional costs will be borne by Metronet.
Metronet is currently unable to access its lending facilities.
Metronet, its banks and shareholders are in discussion about how to ensure that Metronet is able to continue until the completion of the Extraordinary Review.
Metronets financial structure demands that a resolution of this issue is achieved if it is to continue to be able to deliver its PPP programme.
Given the current uncertainties associated with Metronets funding position and the outcome of the Extraordinary Review process, the results for the Group for the year include an exceptional loss of 91.3m after Joint Venture tax.
This exceptional loss has no cash impact but reduces the carrying value of the Groups investment in Metronet to nil.
Trans4m Joint Venture Trans4m is primarily responsible for the delivery of improvements to stations, which as indicated above remain behind plan, and its costs have risen significantly.
Trans4m has recently started awarding station contracts to outside contractors rather than using companies within its tied supply chain.
To further address the stations programme, Metronet and its shareholders have recently reached agreement on heads of terms for the future early termination of Trans4ms contract.
This agreement is subject to approval from Metronets banks.
Trans4m bears a contractual share of the cost over-run together with penalties for late delivery of stations into service.
Although Trans4ms liabilities for the cost over-runs are capped, the Groups results include an exceptional loss from Trans4m of 26.0m after Joint Venture tax to take account of the expected outturn for Trans4ms remaining contract.
The cash impact of this is expected to be around 30m, the majority of which will be paid by Atkins to Trans4m during the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
Atkins supply chain The work that Atkins carries out for Trans4m is primarily related to stations design.
Given the changes to Trans4ms supply chain noted above, some of the work that Atkins was originally in line to undertake may now be carried out by other companies.
As a result an exceptional loss of 4.0m is included in the results for the year to take account of expected future losses.
Our supply chain performance is expected to result in a cash outflow of around 35m during the year ending 31 March 2008, primarily in settlement of previously accounted for liabilities.

The Employee Benets Trusts, which held 3,251,358 ordinary shares 2006: 4,367,898, have agreed to waive a proportion of their dividends relating to the year.
As at 31 March 2007 dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share had been waived on 3,247,622 of the shares held in return for an equivalent gift.
These arrangements reduced the dividend paid in year by 0.6m 2006: 0.5m and the proposed final dividend by 0.5m 2006: 0.5m.
EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs which have not unconditionally vested in the employees.

The recoverable amount of goodwill has been based on value in use as represented by the net present value of future cash flows.
Cash flows are projected forward for five years based on approved budgets and plans, beyond which they are inflated by a GDP-based growth factor.
They are then discounted using a discount rate based on the Groups post-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital.
Following the impairment test during the year and the prior year, no charge has been recognised through the income statement in respect of goodwill impairment.
The allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units has been completed during the year.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT LIABILITIES The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The two main defined benefit schemes are the Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded final salary schemes.
The assets of both schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent.
During the year the Group undertook discussions with the Trustees of the Atkins Pension Plan to explore ways of limiting any further increases in the Groups defined benefit liabilities.
Subsequently a proposal involving the closure of the scheme to future accrual of benefit was put before the members of the scheme during a two-month consultation period that ended on 18 May 2007.
The outcome of the consultation is currently being evaluated and a final decision regarding changes to the plan is expected shortly.
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are now offered membership of the defined contribution section.

WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 PAGE NINETY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The approximate effect on the liabilities from changes in the main assumptions used to value the liabilities are as follows: CHANGE IN ASSUMPTION EFFECT ON PLAN LIABILITIES ATKINS PENSION PLAN RAILWAYS PENSION SCHEME DISCOUNT RATE INCREASE DECREASE 0.5% DECREASE INCREASE 10.0% DECREASE INCREASE 9.0% INFLATION INCREASE DECREASE 0.5% INCREASE DECREASE 6.5% INCREASE DECREASE 9.0% REAL RATE OF INCREASE IN SALARIES INCREASE DECREASE 0.5% INCREASE DECREASE 2.0% INCREASE DECREASE 3.0% LONGEVITY INCREASE 1 YEAR INCREASE 4.0% INCREASE 3.0% The effect of the change in inflation on liabilities assumes a corresponding increase in salary increases and inflation-related pension increases.
An alternative method of valuation to the projected unit method is a solvency basis, which is a discontinuance measure, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer assuming all active members became deferred pensioners at that date.
This amount represents the notional amount that would have been required at the balance sheet date to settle the retirement benefit liabilities if a defined benefit-type plan were to be wound up.
The Group estimates the amounts required to settle its retirement benefit liabilities on a solvency basis at the balance sheet date are approximately 520.0m Atkins Pension Plan and 30.0m Railways Pension Scheme.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Long-Term Incentive Plan Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2006 onwards A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees which are settled in equity, or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
There are different performance targets for different categories of management.
Awards made to executive directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts on the date of the award.
Full vesting of this portion of the award will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile, 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking with pro rata vesting for intermediate performance.
No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
50% of the award is to be subject to the Companys real growth in normalised earnings per share EPS over the performance period.
For the 2006 awards the growth target required the increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index RPI in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting: if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI then there will be no vesting.
A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition.
As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse.
In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2003 to August 2006 A share plan for senior executives and key employees to make awards to employees which are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
The performance condition is TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with the financial year beginning immediately after the award is granted.
Full vesting of any award will take place for a top 20% ranking against a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median.
The EPS growth underpin is the UK RPI plus 2% per annum.
Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP pre September 2003 A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees which are settled in equity.
Awards have an EPS performance condition.
EPS growth is required to be more than 12% per annum above the UK RPI in the relevant three-year performance period to enable all of the ordinary shares to be acquired, but if the EPS growth is less than 5% per annum above the UK RPI then none of the ordinary shares can be acquired.
A sliding scale in relation to the number of ordinary shares that can be acquired operates for growth in EPS between 5% and 12% above the UK RPI.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the award between vesting and exercise.
Atkins Pre-Tax Equity Participation Plan Pre-Tax EPP A share plan for senior executives and key employees which was designed to encourage investment in the Group by taking all or part of their bonus in the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares the Bonus Award which, if retained for a three-year period, gave them a right to obtain a matching number of ordinary shares the Matching Award.
The right to the matching ordinary shares is subject to a performance condition identical to those in the WS Atkins 2003 Senior Executive and Key Employee Long Term Incentive Plan prior to amendment on 16 September 2003.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest, on the shares subject to the Bonus Award after exercise and the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the Matching Award between vesting and exercise.
As a general rule Matching Awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse.
Atkins Post-Tax Equity Participation Plan Post-Tax EPP A share plan for senior executives and key employees which was designed to encourage investment in the Group by taking all or part of their bonus in the form of ordinary shares the Deposited Shares which, if retained for a three-year period, gave them a right to obtain a matching number of ordinary shares the Matching Award.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the Matching Award between vesting and exercise.
All awards have now vested.
WS Atkins Employees Stock Option Plan ESOP A share plan used to make awards to key employees in the US which is settled in equity or in cash and which permits options to be granted at an exercise price no lower than the market price of a share at the time of grant.
Options vest after three years and must be exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 PAGE NINETY-TWO NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Atkins Restricted Stock Unit Plan RSU A share plan used to make awards to key employees following the acquisition of Hanscomb.
There is no performance condition but awards are restricted for three years from the date of award.
In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they will receive their award in full.
Deferred Bonus Plan Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan DBP A share plan for senior executives and key employees which is settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
There is no performance condition but awards are restricted for at least three years from the date of award.
In the case of awards to executive directors and senior executives, the value of the shares over which an award may be granted under the plan shall be taken to form part of the annual bonus payable to that participant.
Awards may also be granted under the plan to employees below the level of senior executives which do not form part of their annual bonus for instance, on recruitment of the employee.
Sharesave Schemes Atkins Sharesave Scheme Sharesave A savings-related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted.
The option price was set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
Participants leaving for a qualifying reason have six months in which to use their savings to exercise their options on a pro-rated basis.

On 28 July 2006 the Group issued a further 1,168 awards to employees under the DBP.
On 11 September 2006 the Group issued awards over 577,119 shares to employees under the Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
On 28 November 2006 the Group issued awards over 41,100 shares to employees under the DBP.
On 7 December 2006 the Group issued awards over 3,567 shares to employees under the DBP.
At 31 March 2007 the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts held 3,251,358 shares 2006: 4,367,898 shares at a nominal value of 0.0m 2006: 0.0m and market value of 31.6m 2006: 35.6m.
For the purposes of valuing LTIP awards with market performance conditions, the Monte-Carlo model has been used to arrive at the share-based payments charge.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: LTIP LTIP 2007 2006 RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE N A 5 % DIVIDEND YIELD 0% 2 % VOLATILITY 22.3% 26% SHARE PRICE AT GRANT DATE 24 06 2005 670.0p 01 12 2005 742.5p 11 09 2006 837.0p OPTION LIFE 3 to 10 YEARS 3 to 10 YEARS EXPECTED EXERCISE BEHAVIOUR OPTIONS 100% in YEAR 4 70% YEAR 4 15% YEAR 5 10% YEAR 6 5% YEARS 7 to 10 ALLOCATIONS 100% YEAR 4 100% YEAR 4 Volatility was determined based on the movement in the share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over which the TSR condition applies, which equates to a three-year share price history 2006: a two-year share price history.
The fair value of share plans involving market performance conditions takes into account market information.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte-Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group.
In 2007 the comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts 2006: a group of 15 competitor companies.
The model takes into account historic dividends and share price volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at date of award and discounted in the event that the award does not benefit from dividends during the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 797.50p 2006: 477.81p.

EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE In 2007, the UK government announced its intention to reduce the UK corporate income tax rate from 30 percent to 28 percent with effect from April 2008.
