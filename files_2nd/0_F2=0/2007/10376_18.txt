ii The expected dividend yield input for the grant of Performance Restricted Share Plan options in 2006 and 2007 is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of the ordinary dividends paid during the vesting period.
iii The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
Where insufficient share price data is available, competitor share price volatility data over a longer period equal to the expected life of the option or share award is considered.
iv The expected term of the options is taken to be the midpoint between vesting and lapse, except for the Performance Restricted Share Plan where the terms of the plan resulted in it being advantageous for participants to exercise directly after vesting.
In this case the expected life has been assumed to equate to the vesting period.
v The fair value of the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan awarded in FY 2007 is equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The fair value of the Share Incentive Plan shares is equal to the share price on the date of grant as there is no option price to be paid and employees are entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
Hence the assumptions set out above are not relevant to this scheme.

Pensions Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells&Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HM Revenue & Customs approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the preliminary results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 and expected to be finalised in December 2007 updated by the Schemes qualified actuaries to 29 September 2007.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 29 September 2007 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the defined benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
In the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2007, the Group paid regular contributions of 10m 2006 11m and additional contributions of 40m 2006 20m in respect of the defined benefit arrangements.
In addition the Group paid 1m 2006 1m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements.
The preliminary results of the 2007 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and a formal recovery plan to 2017 is being finalised with the Trustees.
The result of this is that the Group will make additional contributions of 24m in the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2008, of which 20m represents the final instalment of the previously agreed schedule of contributions.
This will be followed by further additional contributions of 24m in each of the financial years 2009 and 2010, as part of the recovery plan to close the deficit by 2017.
The level of additional contributions will be subject to review during the next actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010.
Employer contribution rates to the defined benefit arrangements for the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2008 are expected to be 24.2% for the MABPP and 42.0% for the MABEPP.
Based on these expected contribution rates, it is estimated that total contributions in the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2008 will be 38m, comprising regular contributions of 14m, including 1m payable in respect of the defined contribution arrangements and additional contributions of 24m.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Wages and salaries increases 4.9% 4.4% 4.3% 4.3% 4.2% Pensions increases 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% 2.8% 2.7% Discount rate 5.9% 5.0% 5.0% 5.5% 5.3% Inflation rate 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% 2.8% 2.7% For MABPP members 5.9% for MABEPP members.
Includes allowance for promotional salary increases.

Pensions continued Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 year of birth standard tables with allowance for medium cohort projections, with ages rated up by two years for non-retired members of the MABPP, by three years for current pensioners and rated down by two years for members of the MABEPP.
The mortality assumptions adopted have been updated to allow for improvements in life expectancies, taking into account an analysis of the recent experience of the Plans.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2007 2006 Main Plan Exec Plan Main Plan Exec Plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 19.4 23.6 17.8 17.7 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 21.2 24.8 19.4 19.5 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 22.2 26.5 20.7 20.7 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 24.0 27.7 22.4 22.4 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 6.1% at 29 September 2007.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the year was 9.1% 2006 10.8%.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2007 2006 Long-term Long-term rates rates of return of return expected Value expected Value %m % m Equities 7.9 345 7.5 596 Bonds 5.9 854 4.6 488 Property 7.9 93 7.5 98 Fair value of assets 1,292 1,182 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,310 1,281 Deficit in the schemes recognised as a liability in the balance sheet 18 99 Associated deferred tax asset 5 32 The following amounts relating to the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of recognised income and expense: 2007 2006 Group income statement m m Operating profit: Current service cost defined benefit plans 13 14 Current service cost defined contribution plans 1 1 Charge to operating profit 14 15 Finance income: Expected return on pension scheme assets 74 69 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 63 61 Net finance income in respect of pensions 11 8 Total charge 3 7 64 Mitchells & Butlers Annual report and accounts 2007 Overview Operating Reports Accounts Shareholder and financial information review 8.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 26 September 2004.

Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items see note 9 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

All amortisation charges have been expensed through operating costs.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill relates entirely to the German business, which is also the non-UK reportable segment.
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
As part of the impairment review the recoverable amount for this business is based on value in use.
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on current year data.
Cash flows beyond the current year have been extrapolated using a steady 1.5% growth rate which does not exceed the long-term estimated inflation rate for the German market.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding revenue and discount rates.
The post-tax discount rate used to calculate value in use is 7% 2006 6%.
This discount rate is derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the effects of taxation and for specific risks relating to the German business.
Revenue growth is assumed to be in line with inflation of 1.5% and profit margins are based on current levels.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to changes in assumptions in respect of revenues.
However, management believes that the current assumptions used are reasonable.
Impairment reviews were performed on 1 October 2005, 30 September 2006 and 29 September 2007 by comparing the carrying value of the business to which goodwill relates with the recoverable amount.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.

The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of the location, the quality of the pub or restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Land and buildings identified for disposal, leasehold outlets with an unexpired term of 50 years or less and fixtures, fittings and equipment, are included at cost, less depreciation.
The 2006 deemed cost carrying value of the Groups property, plant and equipment reflects a valuation undertaken in 1999 which covered all properties then owned by the Group other than leasehold properties having an unexpired term of 50 years or less and which amounted to 328m at 30 September 2006.
This valuation was undertaken by external chartered surveyors, Chesterton plc, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The basis of valuation was predominantly existing use value and had regard to trading potential.
In 1996, a group restructuring by Six Continents resulted in the transfer at book value of certain property, plant and equipment to a subsidiary that subsequently became part of the Mitchells & Butlers group.
The book value included the effect of revaluations undertaken prior to 1996.
Accordingly, the 2006 carrying value of the Groups property, plant and equipment reflects those revaluations in its deemed cost under IFRS, which at 30 September 2006 amounted to 374m.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 4,321m 2006 3,273m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.

Non-current assets held for sale continued Non-current assets held for sale and the disposal group comprise certain operating properties which have been approved for sale, such that the carrying amount is expected to be recovered through a sale, rather than through continuing use.
Sales are expected within 12 months from the date of classification.
The disposal group held for sale in 2006 represents assets which were sold to Trust Inns Ltd for 101m on 5 October 2006 in a single transaction.
This represents the only material disposal included within Profits on disposal of properties in note 9 Exceptional items.

The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a Special Dividend.
On 15 September 2006 Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc completed the issue of 655m of further secured loan notes in the form of the A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes as detailed below.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation in November 2003.
The funds raised were mainly used to return 486m to shareholders by way of a Special Dividend and to provide long-term funding for the Whitbread pub restaurant sites acquired.
As part of the issue, the original A1 and A3 loan note tranches were repaid and reissued as A1N and A3N loan notes to take advantage of market rates.

The expected remaining weighted average life WAL is based on the amortisation profile of the individual note tranches and assumes refinancing of the notes on the margin step-up dates.
The margin step-up dates as at 29 September 2007 are set out below.
The notes are secured on the majority of the Groups property and future income streams therefrom.
All of the floating rate notes are fully hedged using interest rate swaps which fix the interest rate payable.
Interest and margin is payable on the floating rate notes as follows: Tranche Interest Margin Margin step-up date Post step-up margin A1N 3 month LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45% A3N 3 month US$ LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45% A4 3 month LIBOR 0.23% December 2013 0.58% AB 3 month LIBOR 0.24% December 2013 0.60% C2 3 month LIBOR 0.75% December 2013 1.88% D1 3 month LIBOR 0.85% December 2013 2.13% The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 5.7% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 29 September 2007, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of 89m 2006 73m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 9m 2006 8m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in a secured account restricted cash.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.

As at 29 September 2007 the Group has drawn an amount of 192m against this facility.
Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies is set out in the discussion of Treasury policies on page 21 in the Operating and financial review.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
The primary treasury objectives of the Group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
Financial risk management The main risks which impact the Group result from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage these risks and are described below.
Interest rate risk The Group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivatives.
The Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of hedge accounting provisions where appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Groups foreign exchange exposure primarily results from the issue of US$418.75m of Class A3N floating rate notes which form part of the securitised debt see note 20.
At issuance of the notes the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and the interest elements of the notes.
After taking into account these hedging arrangements, the Group does not have a material profit and loss account exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
In addition, the Group is predominantly UK based and therefore does not have a significant currency exposure from its operations.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Mitchells & Butlers 75 Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 21.
Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges At 29 September 2007, the Group held 10 2006 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 1,105m 2006 1,105m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 1,105m 2006 1,105m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8938% 2006 4.8938%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair value, which is an asset of 36m 2006 33m liability.
At 29 September 2007 the Group held 1 2006 1 cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 250m 2006 250m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of 250m 2006 250m of the Groups A3N floating rate US$418.75m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value liability of 48m 2006 29m liability.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a fixed rate, in sterling, of 5.4445% 2006 5.4445%.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised directly in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed above have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a gain of 55m 2006 22m loss on cash flow hedges was recognised directly in equity.
A loss of 15m 2006 16m was removed from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting Following the comprehensive review of the Groups options for releasing value from its property portfolio the Group announced on 21 May 2007 its intention to form a property joint venture with R20.
In the final stage of the planned transaction, the Group and R20 separately entered into a number of derivative transactions which were intended to be contributed to the joint venture.
Their purpose was to fix the variable cash flows resulting from the inflation linked rental payments receivable by the proposed property joint venture and the LIBOR linked interest payments on the new debt, as well as to insulate the Group from movements in the fair value of its fixed rate debt.
76 Mitchells & Butlers Annual report and accounts 2007 Overview Operating Reports Accounts Shareholder and financial information review 21.
Financial instruments continued Whilst these instruments provide an economic hedge against the future anticipated cash flows associated with a property based refinancing they do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in IAS39.
Movements in their fair values are therefore recognised directly in the Group income statement, within exceptional finance costs.
The total fair value movement of these instruments during the year reported within exceptional finance costs was 221 m and is analysed further below.
Fair value Fair value 2007 2006 Note m m Interest Rate Derivative Transactions 5.4390% interest rate swap a 39 5.4390% interest rate swap a 39 5.5705% interest rate swap b 43 5.2152% interest rate swap c 58 Gilt hedges combined notional principal of 1,385m b 34 Inflation Derivative Transactions 3.1775% inflation swaps d 154 221 a The two 5.4390% forward starting interest rate swaps, were entered into in July 2007 and both have a notional principal of 1,105m.
Under the first swap, the Group receives fixed rate interest at 5.4390% and pays floating rate interest at LIBOR and under the second swap the Group pays fixed rate interest at 5.4390% and receives floating rate interest at LIBOR.
Their purpose is to enable the movements in the fair value of the Groups existing securitisation hedges to be recorded for the benefit of the proposed property based financing entity, from the period that a transaction is executed.
The start date of the swaps will be dependent upon the date of execution of the property based refinancing.
The maturity date is 15 September 2036. b The 5.5705% forward starting interest rate swap was executed in July 2007 and has a notional principal of 1,300m.
The Group pays fixed rate interest at 5.5705% and receives floating rate interest at LIBOR.
Four reverse gilt locks with a combined notional principal of 1,385m were executed in July 2007 to mitigate against movements in the fair value of the Groups existing fixed rate bonds.
The purpose of the swap is to replicate the impact of the Groups existing fixed rate debt so that movements in the fair value from the transaction date would be for the benefit of the proposed property based financing entity.
The reverse gilt locks mitigate against movements in the fair value of the Groups fixed rate debt, offsetting the movement in fair value of the 5.5705% interest rate swap.
The start date of the swap will be dependent upon the date of execution of the property based refinancing.
The maturity date is 15 September 2030.
The reverse gilt locks all have a maturity date of 5 December 2007. c The 5.2152% forward starting interest rate swap was entered into in July 2007 and has an accrediting and amortising notional principal of 990m.
The Group pays fixed rate interest at 5.2152% and receives floating rate interest at LIBOR.
The purpose of the swap is to hedge against LIBOR movements associated with the incremental debt intended to be raised by the proposed property based financing entity.
The maturity date is 15 September 2037. d In July 2007, the Group entered into two forward starting inflation swaps with a notional quarterly principal of 30m each.
The Group receives an annual fixed increase of 3.1775% and pays a variable cash flow based on annual increases in the Retail Price Index within a collar of 0% and 5%.
The two inflation swaps are intended to fix the expected rental income stream receivable by the proposed property based financing entity, which would increase annually by the Retail Price Index subject to a collar of 0% and 5%.
The maturity date is 15 June 2037.
All cash flows under the above swaps are payable or receivable on a quarterly basis.
Mitchells & Butlers 77 Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 21.
Financial instruments continued The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows.

This reflects the fact that the terms of these hedge contracts at 29 September 2007 contained an early termination provision effective on 17 December 2007, subject to extension by mutual agreement between the parties.
These terms have now been extended to be effective on 17 December 2008, subject to further extension by mutual agreement between the parties.

The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.

A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax losses with a value of 5m 2006 5m because it is not certain that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefit.
These tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

Details of options granted under the Groups share schemes are contained in note 7.
Employee share trusts The Company has established two employee share trusts: Share Incentive Plan SIP Trust The SIP Trust was established in 2003 to purchase shares on behalf of employees participating in the Companys Share Incentive Plan.
Under this scheme, eligible employees are awarded free shares which are normally held in trust for a holding period of at least three years.
After five years the shares may be transferred to or sold by the employee free of income tax and National Insurance contributions.
The SIP Trust buys the shares in the market with funds provided by the Company.
During the holding period, dividends are paid directly to the participating employees.
At 29 September 2007, the trustees, Hill Samuel ESOP Trustee Limited, were holding 740,210 2006 910,578 shares in the Company.
Of these shares, 419,918 2006 715,583 have been conditionally gifted to employees and 306,304 2006 163,716 have been unconditionally gifted to employees, with the remaining 13,988 2006 31,279 shares being unallocated.
Employee Benefit Trust EBT The EBT was established in 2003 in order to satisfy the exercise or vesting of existing and future share options and awards under the Executive Share Option Plan, Performance Restricted Share Plan, Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan, Sharesave Plan and the Rolled-over options.
The EBT purchases shares in the market from time to time, using funds provided by the Company, based on expectations of future requirements.
Dividends are waived by the EBT.
At 29 September 2007, the trustees, Mourant ECS Trustees Jersey Limited, were holding 330,239 2006 1,299,046 shares in the Company.
