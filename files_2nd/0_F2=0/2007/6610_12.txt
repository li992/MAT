This programme is expected to deliver total annual pre-tax savings of up to 700 million by 2010 with savings realised across the business.
In manufacturing, GSK will reduce the overall number of sites operating in its network and simplify processes and site activities to reduce overcapacity.
The Group will also continue to seek opportunities to outsource the manufacturing of existing products and for low-cost sourcing of materials, whilst focusing its capability on new products.
GSK has conducted several sales force pilot initiatives to assess new sales structures and selling techniques.
Results from these initiatives have provided GSK with new opportunities to evolve its traditional selling methods competitively, including adopting more tailored and customised sales approaches in both developed and emerging markets.
In R&D, GSK will continue to invest in the development of its promising late-stage pipeline and will increase investment in key areas of future growth, such as biopharmaceuticals, oncology, vaccines, neuroscience and emerging markets such as China.
Cost savings in R&D will be focused on simpli cation and streamlining of support infrastructure.
Total one-off costs for implementation of the new programme are expected to be approximately 1.5 billion, to be incurred over the period from 2007 to 2010.
In addition, in December 2007 GSK acquired Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the USA.
A rationalisation and restructuring programme has been initiated as part of the integration of Reliant Pharmaceuticals into the Group, although no costs were incured under this programme in 2007.

The impact of these overseas taxes on the companys overall rate of tax is shown above.
Pro ts arising from certain operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in these territories.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 4.9p in 2007, 7.2p in 2006 and 2.7p in 2005.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised intercompany pro t arising on inventory held by the Group at the year-end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the inventory is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the pro t was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
As a result of this difference in accounting treatment the Group tax rate under IFRS decreased by 0.8% in 2007 2006 1.9% decrease, 2005 1.0% increase as a result of changes in work-in-progress and nished goods.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving signi cant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the pro ts on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
The Groups main open tax issues are in the UK, the US, Canada and Japan.
GSK continues to be in dispute with HMRC primarily in respect of transfer pricing and Controlled Foreign Companies CFC matters for the years 1994 to date.
HMRC have not yet formalised claims in respect of these matters and GSK is seeking to resolve them in discussions with HMRC.
There continues however to be a wide difference between the Group and HMRC positions, which may ultimately need to be settled by litigation.
Following its audit of the period 2001 to 2003, the IRS has in Notices of Proposed Adjustment challenged deductions arising from intercompany nancing arrangements for those years, with which GSK disagrees and which it will vigorously contest.
GSK estimates that the IRS claim for tax and interest at 31st December 2007 net of federal tax relief for these years, is $680 million.
GSK believes, supported by external professional advice, that this claim has no merit and that no adjustment is warranted.
If, contrary to GSKs view, the IRS prevailed in its argument before a court, the company would expect to have an additional liability for the four year unaudited period 2004-2007 proportionate to its liability for the three year audited period 2001-2003.
In the event that the company is not able to resolve this issue with the IRS, a court decision would not be expected before 2010.
Lower courts in Japan have upheld claims by the tax authorities for Yen 39 billion 177 million relating to Japanese CFC legislation.
The company has paid and fully provided for the full tax but is pursuing a claim for refund to the Japanese Supreme Court.
In Canada a court hearing in respect of transfer pricing in the early 1990s was completed in July 2006.
GSK is still awaiting the courts judgement.
108 I GSK Annual Report 2007 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Taxation continued GSK uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing and other taxation issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities.
No provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of pro ts retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of pro t retained at 31st December 2007 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted pro ts at the balance sheet date was approximately 31 billion 2006 26 billion.

At 31st December 2007, the Group had not recognised any deferred tax asset in respect of income tax losses of approximately 3,688 million 2006 3,742 million, of which 62 million 2006 131 million are due to expire between 20082019, 45 million 2006 21 million are due to expire between 20202028 and 3,581 million 2006 3,590 million which are available inde nitely.
The Group had capital losses at 31st December 2007 of approximately 9 billion in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
A substantial part of both income tax and capital losses are still subject to agreement by relevant tax authorities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable pro t will be available to utilise losses.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using business performance earnings.
The calculation of business performance, a supplemental non-IFRS measure, is described in Note 1 Presentation of the financial statements.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

GSK Annual Report 2007 I 111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Property, plant and equipment continued Included in land and buildings at 31st December 2007 are leased assets with a cost of 424 million 2006 241 million, accumulated depreciation of 198 million 2006 95 million and a net book value of 226 million 2006 146 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31st December 2007 are leased assets with a cost of 180 million 2006 263 million, accumulated depreciation of 81 million 2006 97 million, and a net book value of 99 million at 1st January 2007 166 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country speci c risks.
Where an impairment is indicated a pre-tax cash ow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash ows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The impairment losses have been charged through cost of sales 117 million, R&D 44 million and SG&A 3 million.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
The principal component of the 2007 reversals relates to the Suzhou pharmaceuticals manufacturing facility, where a planned withdrawal of manufacturing of a key product has been terminated.
The recoverable amount has been calculated by applying a value in use calculation and a 12% discount rate.

See Note 38, Acquisitions and disposals for further details.
The impairments in the year of 2 million relate to the Europharm business located in Romania and were determined using the fair value less costs to sell model.
The carrying value of goodwill is made up of balances arising on acquisition of the following companies: 2007 2006 m m ID Biomedical Corporation 367 316 Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 356 Domantis Limited 181 CNS, Inc. 111 112 GlaxoSmithKline K. K. 140 134 Polfa Poznan S. A.
111 96 Corixa Corporation 24 25 Others 80 75 1,370 758 Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units which are tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a value in use or a fair value less costs to sell model, depending on the nature of the unit.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, five-year post-tax cash ows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
Initially a post-tax discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country speci c risks, is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash ows.
Where this indicates that the recoverable value of the unit is close to or below its carrying value, the impairment test is reperformed using a pre-tax discount rate and pre-tax cash ows in order to determine if an impairment exists and to establish its magnitude.
Fair value is calculated using a discounted cash ow approach, which in this case is based on the Groups acquisition valuation model.
A post-tax discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital is applied, adjusted where appropriate for country speci c risks.
This rate is applied to projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows.
112 I GSK Annual Report 2007 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Goodwill continued The cash generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit is signi cant in comparison with the total goodwill balance are Vaccines, Consumer Healthcare, US Pharmaceuticals, worldwide Pharmaceuticals, Japan and Poland.
Total goodwill of 414 million 2006 362 million, principally relating to the acquisitions of ID Biomedical and Corixa, is allocated to the Vaccines unit.
The recoverable value of this unit is determined using the fair value less costs to sell model.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the minority interest in GlaxoSmithKine K. K. of 140 million 2006 134 million and on the acquisition of Polfa Poznan of 111 million 2006 96 million is allocated to the Japan and Poland cash generating units respectively.
The recoverable value of both these units is determined using the value in use model.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of CNS, Inc. in December 2006 is allocated to the Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit.
As Domantis Limited is a research operation, the goodwill arising on the acquisition has been allocated to the worldwide Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in December 2007 is allocated to the US Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and pro table market sectors, with similar risk pro les, and their size, diversi cation and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology, using five year post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country-speci c risks.
The main assumptions include future sales prices and volumes, product contribution, the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdiction and the products useful economic life.
These assumptions are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.

These principally arise from 50% interests in two joint ventures,  Holdings, L. P. which is developing speci ed chemical compounds, and GlaxoSmithKline Shire Canada, which primarily co-markets Combivir, Trizivir and Epivir in certain territories, together with a 30% interest in another joint venture, Pharmaceutical Insurance Limited, which is a mutual insurance company covering pharmaceutical property risk.
In 2002, GSK hedged part of the equity value of its holding in Quest Diagnostics Inc. through a series of variable sale forward contracts.
The contracts the equity collar were renewed in 2006 and are structured in five series, each over two million Quest shares, and mature between 2010 and 2012.
The fair value of the contracts at 31st December 2007 was a liability of $4 million 2006 $24 million.
A second series of hedging contracts over an additional 10 million shares was entered into on 15th February 2007.
These contracts are also structured in five series, each over two million Quest shares, and mature between 2013 and 2015.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by reference to the current market value of similar instruments or by reference to the discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
Equity investments are recorded as non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 413 million 2006 348 million that offer the Group the opportunity for return through dividend income and fair value gains.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassi ed from reserves to the income statement based on average cost.
The impairment losses recorded in the tables above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts recycled from the fair value reserve Note 8, Other operating income on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or signi cant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

Provisions are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully re ect the final outcome and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of provision is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the provisions are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension bene ts can be provided by state schemes: by fide ned contribution schemes, whereby retirement bene ts are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by fide ned bene t schemes, whereby retirement bene ts are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid fide ned bene t schemes also include fide ned contribution sections.
Contributions to fide ned bene t schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally quali ed actuaries.
Pension costs of fide ned bene t schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension bene ts are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The UK discount rate is based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA index and the US discount rate is based on corporate bond yields which re ect the term of the expected bene t payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds re ects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
An equity risk premium of between 3% and 4% is added to longer term government bond yields to give the expected rate of return on equities.
Projected in ation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the PA92 standard mortality tables to re ect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to re ect improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort i. e. improvements at recently observed higher levels which are assumed to continue to 2020 with minimum improvements thereafter of 1% per year for males and 0.5% for females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The mortality assumptions for the UK and US schemes were set following a review in December 2007.
GSK expects to review these again in December 2008.
GSK Annual Report 2007 I 117 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Pensions and other post-employment bene ts continued The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2027 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 26.8 28.0 24.4 26.1 Projected for 2027 29.2 29.8 25.9 27.0 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversi ed to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
Following an asset liability study in 2007, the Group decided to adopt a strategy to reduce gradually the allocation of investment in equities.
In the UK it is proposed that the strategy will be linked to the funding levels in the schemes and this will be considered further with the trustees of the UK schemes in 2008.
The allocation of equities and property in the US scheme will be reduced from 80% of the total to 60% in 2008.
In the UK the fide ned bene t pension schemes operated for the bene t of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a fide ned contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham fide ned bene t schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.

120 I GSK Annual Report 2007 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Pensions and other post-employment bene ts continued The liability for the US post-retirement healthcare scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical in ation of 8.5% 2006 9.25%, reducing by 0.75% per year to 5% in 2013 and thereafter.
During 2007, the US post-retirement healthcare scheme was amended.
The main change was an increase in the cap on company costs.
At the year-end the plan obligation was 879 million.
However, in accordance with IAS 19 the unvested part of a bene t improvement is not recognised immediately on the balance sheet but is recognised gradually through the income statement.
At the year-end the unrecognised amount was 47 million and the amount recognised on the balance sheet was therefore 832 million 2006 927 million, 2005 1,133 million.
The Group provides certain medical bene ts to disabled employees and their spouses in the USA.
The obligations for these bene ts which were transferred at a value of 89 million are now shown within other provisions.
The fide ned bene t pension obligation is analysed as follows: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Funded 10,079 10,099 9,858 Unfunded 259 246 268 10,338 10,345 10,126 Post-retirement bene ts are unfunded.

During 2007, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK pension schemes totalling 285 million 2006 346 million to the UK and US pension schemes.
In 2006, GSK formalised an agreement with the trustees of the UK fide ned bene t pension schemes to make additional contributions of up to 325 million per year in addition to the normal contributions, over a four-year period ending 31st December 2009 in order to eliminate the then pension fide cits on an IAS 19 basis.
Employer contributions for 2008, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 200 million in respect of fide ned bene t pension schemes and 40 million in respect of post-retirement bene ts.

Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to US anti-trust, product liability, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The companys Directors, having taken legal and other specialist advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements.
The discount on these provisions decreased by 10 million in 2007 2006 - 2 million increase and was calculated using risk-adjusted projected cash ows and risk-free rates of return.
The movement in 2007 includes a decrease of 34 million arising from a change in the discount rate in the year.
A number of products have a history of claims made and settlements which makes it possible to use an IBNR incurred but not reported actuarial technique to determine a reasonable estimate of the Groups exposure for unasserted claims in relation to those products.
Apart from the IBNR provision, no provisions have been made for unasserted claims.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters, including those provided using the IBNR actuarial technique, may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over several years.
The largest individual amounts provided are expected to be settled within three years.
At 31st December 2007, it is expected that 89 million 2006 120 million of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed by third party insurers.
This amount is included within current and non-current assets.
For a discussion of legal issues, refer to Note 44 Legal proceedings.
New Operational Excellence programme In October 2007, GSK announced a signi cant new 1.5 billion Operational Excellence programme to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its operations.
This new programme is expected to deliver annual pre-tax savings of 700 million by 2010.
GSK expects to realise the majority of annual savings within the first two years of the programme, with approximately 350 million expected by 2008 and 550 million by 2009.
These savings will partly mitigate the expected impact to 2008 earnings from generic competition and lower Avandia sales and the associated adverse impact on GSKs gross margin.
Costs recognised as a provision, principally in respect of identi ed severances at sites where it has been announced that manufacturing activities will be reduced or cease, are expected to be incurred mainly in 2008 and 2009.
Asset retirement obligations recognised as a provision amount to 29 million in the year.
Costs of asset write-downs have been recognised as impairments of property, plant and equipment.
Employee related provisions Employee related provisions includes the exchange offer incentive programme which operated at the time of the merger to encourage staff to convert Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham share options into GlaxoSmithKline share options.
The incentive is paid either when employees exercise the relevant options, or when the options lapse, up to 2010.
The discount on this provision increased by 7 million in 2007 2006 2 million, and was calculated using risk-free rates of return.
These were transferred from post-retirement bene ts at a value of 89 million during the year and are re ected in the total reclassi cations and other movements gure of 162 million.
At 31st December 2007, the provision for these bene ts amounted to 73 million.
Other employee bene ts re ect a variety of provisions for severance costs, jubilee awards and other long-service bene ts.
Integration and manufacturing re-organisation The Group has recognised costs in previous years in respect of plans for the integration of the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham businesses.
Implementation of the integration following the merger is substantially complete.
Costs recognised in the remaining merger integration provision in respect of identi ed severances are expected to be incurred in 2008.
Other smaller cost-saving initiatives since the merger are now included within this category.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt and obligations under finance leases, which do not present a material exposure.
These three currencies are the major currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies over the last two years and has concluded that a 10% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Intercompany loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have been excluded from this analysis.
2007 2006 Increase Reduction Increase Reduction in income in equity in income in equity m m m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 38 580 35 195 10% appreciation of the Euro 1 709 436 10% appreciation of the Yen 15 14 A 10% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movements in the income statement relate primarily to the hedging instrument for a US dollar legal provision.
Whilst this is an economic hedge, the provision is not a financial instrument and therefore is not included in the table above.
The movements in equity relate to foreign exchange positions used to hedge Group assets denominated in US dollar, Euro and Yen.
Therefore, a depreciation on the currency swap would give rise to a corresponding appreciation on the Group asset.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets other than financial instruments is not included above.
GSK Annual Report 2007 I 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its oating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being the currencies in which GSK has historically issued debt and held investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last two years and has concluded that a 1% increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt with a maturity of less than one year is oating rate for this calculation.
A 1% movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2007 2006 Increase decrease Increase decrease in income in income m m 1% increase in Sterling interest rates 1 3 1% increase in US dollar interest rates 16 8 1% increase in Euro interest rates 3 2 A 1% decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
Interest rate movements on obligations under finance leases, foreign currency and interest rate derivatives, trade payables, trade receivables and other financial instruments not in net debt do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet based on a 1% increase or decrease in these interest rates.
Contractual cash ows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following is an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
For the purpose of this table, debt is fide ned as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31st December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31st December.

The majority of contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.
Included in Equity related instruments above are variable sale forward contracts in Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and various equity warrants.
At 31st December 2006 the Group also held put and call options in Theravance, Inc. Further information on the Quest and Theravance derivatives is provided below.
In 2002, GSK hedged part of the equity value of its holdings in Quest, an associated undertaking, through a series of variable sale forward contracts.
The fair value of the contracts at 31st December 2007 was a liability of $4 million 2 million 2006 $24 million 12 million.
The fair value of the contracts at 31st December 2007 was an asset of $15 million 7 million.
At 31st December 2006 the Group held a put option agreement whereby Theravances shareholders could sell up to half of their Theravance shares to GSK at a pre-determined price.
At 31st December 2006, this option was recorded as a liability of $19 million 10 million.
This option expired unexercised in August 2007.
At 31st December 2006, the Group held a call option agreement whereby it could purchase half of the outstanding Theravance shares in issue at a pre-determined price.
At 31st December 2006, this option was recorded as an asset of $15 million 8 million.
This option expired unexercised in July 2007.
At 31st December 2007, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts consisting primarily of currency swaps with a total fair value of 247 million 2006 16 million liability.
These represent hedges of intercompany loans and deposits, but are not designated as accounting hedges.
Changes in fair value are taken to pro t and loss in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company lending and borrowing.
GSK Annual Report 2007 I 143 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Cash ow hedges The Group has entered into a cross currency swap and designated it a cash ow hedge converting xed Euro interest, payable annually, to xed Yen payments.
The risk being hedged is the variability of cash ows arising from currency uctuations.
No ineffectiveness is assumed on the hedge.
All cash ows relating to the hedge are expected to occur within the next two years.
The amounts recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement to offset the exchange gains or losses in the same period on the underlying bond as a result of revaluation at the balance sheet date.
The amount recognised in equity in 2007 for cross currency interest rate swaps was 10 million credit 2006 30 million credit.
The amount recycled from equity to the income statement in 2007 for cross currency interest rate swaps to offset the exchange loss on the underlying bond recognised in the income statement was 14 million 2006 32 million.
The net fair value movements on cash ow hedges are disclosed in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Fair value hedges The Group has designated interest rate swaps and the interest element of one of its two cross currency swaps as a fair value hedge.
The risk being hedged is the variability of the fair value of the bonds arising from interest rate uctuations.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are disclosed in Note 12, Finance costs.
Net investment hedges Foreign exchange contracts and the currency element of one of the Groups two cross currency swaps have been designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk principally arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its US dollar, Euro and Yen foreign operations.
In addition, Euro loan capital issued during the year of 3.5 billion, and 750 million from previous years, has been designated as a non-monetary net investment hedge in respect of the foreign currency translation risk principally arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its Euro operations.
Net investment hedge ineffectiveness is disclosed in Note 11, Finance income.
42 Employee share schemes The Group operates share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at the grant price, savings-related share option schemes and share award schemes, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of speci ed performance targets.
In 2004, the Group introduced a new share award scheme, the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to certain employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Options under the share option schemes are granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and, with effect from the 2004 grant, the CET are subject to performance criteria.
