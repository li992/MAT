3.3 Key measures The management and the Board use a number of financial and operational measures to assess our performance.
Overall financial success We use several financial measures to measure the success of our overall strategy.
The two key measures are profit attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group and Underlying EBIT.
Profit attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group for FY2007 was US$13.4 billion, an increase of US$3.0 billion, or 28.4 per cent, from FY2006.
Underlying EBIT for FY2007 was US$20.1 billion compared with US$15.3 billion in the prior year, an increase of 31.4 per cent.
Underlying EBIT is the internally defined, key financial measure used by management for monitoring the performance of our operations.
We explain the calculations and why we use this measure in section 3.6.
Other measures in addition are as follows: 30 June 30 June 30 June 2007 2006 2005 a Underlying EBIT margin 48.4% 44.4% 39.6% a Return on capital employed 38.4% 34.6% 28.9% Net operating cash flow US$M 15,595 10,476 8,374 a Gearing 22.5% 25.2% 32.8% Earnings per share basic US cents 229.5 173.2 104.4 a Refer to section 11 Glossary for definitions.
All measures are showing a strong financial position from the previous year.
Refer to section 3.6 for a detailed analysis of the operating results.
The following are other measures that assist us to monitor our overall performance.
People and Licence to operate These foundational strategic drivers bring together health, safety, environment and community related measures.
These measures are a subset of the HSEC Targets Scorecard, which can be found in our full Sustainability Report at www.

84 BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2007 5260 BHPB AReport Pt1 11 9 07 8:32 PM Page 85 Our key safety performance measures are Total recordable injury frequency rate TRIFR and fatalities.
In July 2005, we adopted TRIFR as a key measure for safety as the TRIFR measure improves the visibility of all incidents.
Our TRIFR was 7.4 for this year of tracking as compared to 8.7 for the first year of tracking.
There has been an increase in new cases from occupational illnesses from 124 in FY2006 to 264 in FY2007 resulting from an intense focus to reduce the exposures and potential harm brought about by excessive occupational exposure limit to noise.
This focus has brought with it an increased awareness of the issue.
Tragically, eight of our people died at work during FY2007.
This compares to three in FY2006.
The most important measures of environmental performance are land rehabilitation, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and high-quality water use.
Land rehabilitation figures have increased by 66.8 per cent from 2,410 hectares in FY2006 to 4,020 in FY2007.
Key performance indicators are established and aligned to ensure those parts of an operation that are available for closure and or contemporaneous rehabilitation are attended to efficiently and without delay or deferral with the closure plan timetable.
Greenhouse gas emissions have remained virtually constant despite an increase in production.
However, the emissions levels quoted for FY2007 reflect a change in global warming potential factors to be consistent with the Second Assessment Report IPCC 1996 values in FY2007 which decreased the greenhouse gas intensity by 0.6 per cent.
Energy use for the Group has decreased from 305.5 petajoules in FY2006 to 302.5 petajoules in FY2007, representing a 1.0 per cent reduction.
Our increase in high-quality water use was limited to 0.9 per cent despite increases in production based on continuing operations.
Our voluntary contributions to community programs totalled US$103.4 million, equating to 1.1 per cent of pre-tax profits on a three-year rolling average basis, compared to US$81.3 million, or 1.45 per cent, of pre-tax profit for FY2006.
Although the percentage has decreased, the actual value of our community investment has increased significantly due to the increased profits, and continues to exceed our target of 1 per cent.
World-class assets The quality of our world-class assets and the diversity of our portfolio underpin the strength of our cash flow and continue to support our ability to both identify and invest in growth opportunities, while continuing to deliver outstanding returns to shareholders.
In FY2007, we achieved record production for eight major commodities for natural gas, aluminium, alumina, copper cathode, nickel, iron ore, manganese and metallurgical coal, and increased annual production for three further commodities.
Production records were set by 17 assets.
Actual production volumes for this year and the previous two years appear in section 2.3 of this Annual Report.
This reflects our key operating objective of delivering consistent, predictable and sustainable operating performance across all of our businesses providing a stable platform for growth.

Over time, Underlying EBIT, which is defined in section 3.6.
1, is the key measure that reflects the impact of these initiatives.
The estimated savings are reported as annualised amounts that we expect to be able to sustain: however, only the first 12 months of recurring benefits are included.
We estimate that we generated US$203 million of incremental cost savings during FY2007 from Business Excellence initiatives.
Financial strength and discipline Financial strength is measured by attributable profit and Underlying EBIT as overall measures, along with liquidity and capital management.
Our solid A credit rating and net gearing and net debt are discussed in section 3.7.
We have declared our eleventh consecutive increase in dividends.
At the completion of all announced capital management initiatives, we will have returned US$28.2 billion in total to shareholders through capital initiatives and dividends since June 2001.
Project pipeline and growth options Our project pipeline provides significant future value, with 33 projects in either execution or feasibility with an expected capital investment of US$20.9 billion.
We also have further medium-term options in our portfolio with capital expenditure requirements in excess of US$50 billion.
During the year, we continued the ramp-up of five projects, approved three additional projects and commissioned Spence 200,000 tonnes per annum copper operation in Chile.
The details of our project pipeline are located in section 3.7.
