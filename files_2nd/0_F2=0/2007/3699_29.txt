Defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan.

This assessment was updated to 31 December 2007 at which date the net liabilities of the scheme were assessed to be 30.6m.
The Directors of the companies involved in the Group scheme will continue to monitor the level of the pension deficit and take advice from independent actuaries as appropriate.
The scheme has been accounted for as if it was a defined contribution scheme and the charge to the profit and loss account therefore reflects payments for the year.
The cost of contributions to the Group scheme for 2007 amounted to 0.6m 2006: 0.6m of normal funding and a special contribution of 5.3m 2006: 11.5m in order to reduce the scheme deficit.
Contributions to current benefit accruals represent 14.81% of pensionable salary 2006: 16.65%.
No contributions were outstanding at the end of 2007 or 2006.
Defined contribution pension scheme The Company also operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan Money Purchase Section.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The pension costs charged represent contributions payable by the Company to the fund and amounted to 0.3m 2006: 0.1m.
