Income tax expenSe contInueD The effective tax charge for the group is 29.9% 2006: 30.0%, which comprises a charge of 31.8% 2006: 32.4% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 1.9% 2006: 2.4% in respect of prior years.
The following factors that will affect the groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the uK corporate tax rate 30%, 28% from April 2008 and overseas: in particular, France germany Belgium corporate tax rates greater than 30% and Ireland Poland The Netherlands Czech Republic Slovakia corporate tax rates less than 30%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower group tax charge: the impact of permanent disallowables: and the agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities.
The group has taken account of the majority of its trading losses in its deferred tax balance.
Although tax losses can be used to reduce cash payments of tax, utilisation of such losses would result in a deferred tax charge in that year which would eliminate any profit and loss benefit.

Share-BaSeD paymentS contInueD D DeferreD annual BonuS Scheme DaBS Options were granted under the DABS scheme for the first time in 2005.
The DABS operates by inviting participants including Executive Directors to use up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.
Providing certain criteria are met, participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive nil cost matching shares up to a maximum of one per share purchased by the participant.
The criteria are as follows: Percentage of award vesting Percentage growth in the Companys EPS over the three year period from the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by: less than 3% per annum compounded None of the award vests 3% per annum compounded 50% of award vests between 3% and 5% per annum compounded Award vests proportionately between 50% and 100% 5% per annum compounded 100% of award vests DABS ISSuED AFTER 7 NOvEmBER 2002 2007 2006 options Options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 34,782 17,520 granted during the year 11,297 17,262 Outstanding at the end of the year 46,079 34,782 None of the above share options outstanding at the end of the year are exercisable at 31 December 2007.
All DABS are nil paid options and therefore the options outstanding at the balance sheet date had a weighted average exercise price of nilp, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.2 years 2006: 1.8 years.

e Share IncentIve plan SIp Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is an Hm Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2007, 54,014 2006: 50,547 matching shares were granted during the year.
given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the Cgus are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual Cgu.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following years operating budget approved by the Directors and an appropriate projection of cash flows based upon industry expectations for up to five years.
After this period, the growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 2% and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre tax rates and ranged between 11.7% and 13.2%.
There have been no instances of goodwill impairment noted from the annual impairment tests performed in 2007.
The carrying amount of goodwill of 434.9m 2006: 216.3m has been allocated across multiple Cgus.

IntanGIBle aSSetS The intangible assets presented below relate entirely to acquired intangibles.
These arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of acquired intangibles from goodwill.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2006 and 2007, the group owned purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.

The weighted average amortisation period for each category of intangible asset is disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 69.
In the opinion of the Directors, the only intangible asset which has an indefinite useful life is the brand attributable to the acquisition of lS group limited.
The carrying value of the lS brand at the balance sheet date is 12.6m.
An indefinite useful life has been determined for the lS brand on the basis that it is expected to be maintained indefinitely and is expected to continue to drive value for the group.
The recoverable value of the brand is based upon value in use calculations.
Further information on value in use calculations is provided within Note 11.
The Directors have used past experience in determining each of the key assumptions in the value in use calculation for the lS brand.
The growth rates assumed are in line with industry expectations and, for periods beyond those covered by its management forecasts, do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rate applied is 11.7%, equivalent to its pre tax weighted average cost of capital.

Due to the proximity of the timing of some of the acquisitions close to the year end, the Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2008.
The fair value adjustments above relate primarily to: the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their market value: the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the group: and an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the groups policies.
Included within goodwill are staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition by the relevant accounting standards.
The pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit for larivire, which was acquired on 29 June 2007, for the six months ended 29 June 2007 amounted to 121.3m and 7.0m respectively.
The 2007 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of larivire: revenue 111.5m, cost of sales 86.4m and operating expenses 19.7m giving an operating profit of 5.4m.
The Directors estimate the pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the other acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2007 to the respective acquisition dates amounted to 102.1m and 6.0m respectively.
The 2007 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of the other acquisitions: revenue 105.1m, cost of sales 78.9m and operating expenses 19.7m giving an operating profit of 6.5m.
Revenue and operating profit for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2007 for all 2007 acquisitions amounted to 440m and 24.9m respectively.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts of 25.6m 2006: 15.6m relates to trade receivables with a gross balance of 46.7m 2006: 20.4m.
The allowance for doubtful debts represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
creDIt rISK manaGement Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

The following financial assets form part of the net debt of the group: 2007 2006 m m Cash at bank including cash deposits repayable on demand 89.2 62.4 Derivative financial instruments 0.5 1.7 89.7 64.1 The Directors consider the fair value of these financial assets to approximate to their book value.
The interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of interest of up to 6%.
2007 IntereSt rate anD currency profIle The interest rate and currency profile of the groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2007, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments with the exception of the short term currency swaps noted after the table was as follows: Weighted effective average fixed time for floating fixed interest which rate amount amount total rate rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency m m m % years m m Private placement notes Sterling 172.9 12.5 160.4 5.9% 7.5 172.9 Other borrowings Sterling 68.5 30.8 37.7 4.8% 1.7 0.4 68.1 Finance lease contracts Sterling 1.1 1.1 5.2% 1.7 1.0 0.1 Private placement notes Euro 146.2 44.1 102.1 6.1% 3.5 146.2 Other borrowings Euro 99.0 29.7 69.3 4.5% 3.6 5.9 93.1 Finance lease contracts Euro 8.4 8.4 5.8% 3.0 7.2 1.2 Finance lease contracts PlN 0.2 0.2 n a n a 0.2 Other borrowings PlN 19.5 19.5 n a n a 19.5 Other borrowings CZK 2.8 2.7 0.1 3.0% 3.5 0.1 2.7 Total 518.6 139.5 379.1 14.6 504.0 In addition to the currency exposures above, the group has entered into ten short term currency derivative financial instruments as follows: two net investment hedges amounting to an asset of 106.6m and a liability of 135.0m and CZK270.0m: and eight cash flow hedges which hedge the post tax functional currency cash flows of the group amounting to an asset of 123.0m and a liability of 151.5m, CZK145.2m and PlN37.3m.
All of these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 31 December 2007 at market rates and therefore their fair value is deemed to equate to their book value of nil.
The expiry date of these derivative financial instruments is within one year.
Of the above finance lease contracts, 8.2m 2006: 1.8m are secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors consider the fair value of the groups floating rate financial liabilities to approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the groups private placement notes approximates to the amount in the value of the financial liabilities above.
37.7m of the Sterling Other borrowings and 66.1m of the Euro Other borrowings relate to debt on which the group has taken out interest rate derivative financial instruments to fix the interest rate, and the debt is already carried at approximately its fair value in the table above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 12.8m and relates to finance lease contracts and fixed rate loans.
The Directors consider the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to approximate to the book values shown above.

All of these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 29 December 2006 at market rates and therefore their fair value is deemed to equate to their book value of nil.
The expiry date of these derivative financial instruments was 31 December 2007.
The Directors considered the fair value of the groups floating rate financial liabilities to approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
40.0m of the Sterling Other borrowings related to debt on which the group had taken out interest rate derivative financial instruments to fix the interest rate, and the debt is already carried at approximately its fair value in the table above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounted to 8.5m and related to finance lease contracts and fixed rate loans.
The Directors considered the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to approximate to the book values shown above.
In both 2007 and 2006, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to uK lIBOR in the case of Sterling liabilities, EuRIBOR for Euro liabilities, WIBOR for Polish Zloty liabilities and PRIBOR for Czech Koruna liabilities.
heDGInG relatIonShIpS Included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 0.5m 2006: 1.7m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents of 503.6m 2006: 372.8m.
Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 72.2m 2006: 37.8m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 672.3m 2006: 416.9m.
The group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Where the group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as hedge ineffectiveness in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
In order to manage the groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
A NET INvESTmENT HEDgES As at 31 December 2007, the group had entered into five 31 December 2006: four cross-currency derivative financial instruments which form a net investment hedge of the groups Euro and Czech Koruna denominated trading assets.
At 31 December 2007, these five derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 15.4m 31 December 2006: 8.6m.
Of this fair value movement, 1.4m has been recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement as hedge ineffectiveness and 5.4m has been recognised directly in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
B CASH FlOW HEDgES With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity, and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement within Finance costs in the same period the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.

In addition, as at 31 December 2007, the group had entered into one 31 December 2006: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed uS Dollar denominated debt held in the uK into variable Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the group.
At 31 December 2007, these eight derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 28.2m 31 December 2006: 29.3m.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2007, the average maturity date of the these swaps is 7.0 years 2006: 8.0 years.

At 31 December 2007, these nine derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 4.2m 31 December 2006: asset of 0.7m.
All of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

As at 31 December 2007, the group had entered into eight 31 December 2006: three cross-currency derivative financial instruments which swap fixed Sterling denominated debt into fixed Euro, Polish Zloty and Czech Koruna denominated debt.
The movement in fair value of these derivative financial instruments hedge the post tax cash flows of the group and thereby fix the functional currency cash flows of the group and are therefore fully effective.
As these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 31 December 2007 at market rates prevailing at that date, the fair value of these derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2007 was nil.
At 31 December 2007, the average maturity date of the these swaps is one year 2006: one year.

Of these schemes, four 2006: four have assets held in separate trustee administered funds and four 2006: two are overseas book reserved schemes.
The group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The defined benefit schemes are herein after referred to as the main scheme and other schemes, being seven smaller schemes.
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEmE vAluATIONS In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 which was issued on 16 December 2004, the group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefits pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The four uK defined benefit pension schemes were merged on 1 January 2008.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIg plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the main scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2006 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 53.1m and their actuarial value covered 71% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
As a result of the merger, valuations of the second and third defined benefit schemes were not carried out at 31 December 2006.
Consequently the last formal actuarial valuations of the second and third defined benefit schemes were conducted at 1 January 2004 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 7.8m and 1.9m and their actuarial values covered 94% and 70% respectively of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the fourth defined benefit scheme was at 6 April 2004 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1.2m and its actuarial value covered 60% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other four schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.

In accordance with IAS 19 Retirement Benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2007 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The four uK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, have an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
CONSOlIDATED BAlANCE SHEET lIABIlITy The balance sheet position in respect of the eight defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2007 2007 2006 2006 m m m m Deficit in the main scheme 11.1 17.0 Deficit in the other defined benefit schemes 4.6 6.6 Pension liability before taxation 15.7 23.6 Related deferred tax asset 3.4 6.7 Pension liability after taxation 12.3 16.9 The actuarial gain of 6.2m 2006 gain: 3.3m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax debit of 2.0m 2006: 1.0m, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The remaining deferred tax debit of 1.3m 2006: 0.4m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses, gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense amounted to a loss of 1.1m 2006: loss of 7.3m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 12.1m 2006: 21.2m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 3.6m 2006: 2.4m relates to unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2007 2006 m m Pension liability at beginning of year 23.6 27.0 Current service cost 1.9 2.3 Businesses acquired 1.0 Contributions 5.5 2.9 Net finance cost 0.4 0.6 Actuarial gain 6.2 3.3 Exchange difference 0.5 0.1 Pension liability at end of year 15.7 23.6 mAIN SCHEmE DISClOSuRE The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the main scheme were: 2007 2006 2005 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 5.3 5.0 4.8 Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 5.3 5.0 5.0 Rate of increase lPI pensions in payment 3.3 3.0 2.8 Discount rate 5.7 5.1 4.9 Inflation assumption 3.3 3.0 2.8 Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for lPI revaluation in deferment.
For the main pension scheme, the life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 60 is 27.5 years 2006: 24.0 years.
