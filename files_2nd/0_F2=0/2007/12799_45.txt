Interest rate swaps The Group has taken out various interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Punch Taverns Finance plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A3 N, Class B3, Class M2 N and Class D1 floating rate notes to a fixed rate of 5.954%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
At August 2006 interest rate swaps were in place which swapped the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A3 and Class M2 floating rate notes to a fixed rate of 6.275%.
Punch Taverns Finance B Limited Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A8 and Class C notes to a fixed rate of 5.1% and 4.7577% respectively.
Spirit Issuer plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.581% on the Class A1 and Class A2 debenture notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.555% on the Class A3, Class A4 and Class A5 debenture notes.
Although these swaps ensure that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes they were deemed ineffective at the time of acquisition of the Spirit group, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39, and accordingly all future movements in fair value will be recognised in the income statement.
Bank loans held by Punch Taverns plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.572%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the bank loans.
The interest rate exposure on the guaranteed loan notes is mitigated by the interest earned on the cash deposits used as guarantee.
