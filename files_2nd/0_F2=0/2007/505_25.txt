Notes to the Company Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2007 30 Company accounting policies Accounting convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of certain financial instruments in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies is set out below.
Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the assets into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowings costs are not capitalised.
Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
The principal period of depreciation used is as follows: Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years.
Impairment of tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Foreign currencies At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys presentational currency.
Derivative financial instruments The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 75.
Cash ow statement and related party disclosures The Company is included in the Group Accounts of Aggreko plc, which are publicly available.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ow statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 Cash Flow Statements revised 1996.

Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 109 Notes to the Company Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 30 Company accounting policies continued Taxation The charge for ordinary taxation is based on the profit loss for the year and takes into account full provision for deferred tax, using the approach set out in FRS 19, Deferred Tax in respect of timing differences on a non discounted basis.
Such timing differences arise primarily from the differing treatment for taxation and accounting purposes of provisions and depreciation of xed assets.
Pensions The Company operates both a dened benefit pension scheme and a dened contribution pension scheme.
The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 76.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost, or nominal value of the shares issued as consideration where applicable, less provision for any impairment in value.
Share-based payments recharged to subsidiary undertakings are treated as capital contributions and are added to investments.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Company are classied as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Grants Capital grants in respect of additions to xed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the estimated operational lives of the related assets.
Share-based payments The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 77 with the exception that shares issued by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries for which no consideration is received are treated as an increase in the Companys investment in those subsidiaries.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
