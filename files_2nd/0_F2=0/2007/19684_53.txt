Typically interest rate swaps have a maturity of 3 to 5 years at inception and the majority are in the form of knock-out options.
The groups finance strategy is discussed in more detail in the business review.
The counter-parties to all derivative financial instruments are UK and European banks, all of whom also lend to the group.

The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Further details of the groups risk policies and financial instruments are provided in the business review on page 23.
