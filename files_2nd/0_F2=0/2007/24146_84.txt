Post balance sheet events The Group announced on 31 January 2008 the outcome of a significant strategic review.
The proposed strategy will see the Group focus on core segments of the UK and International life and pensions market and will no longer seek to build a presence in the UK wealth management sector, including Wraps.
As a result, the Group will be devising strategies for the three businesses which no longer fit within the new strategy F&C Asset Management, Lombard, Pantheon Financial, and the Wraps business will be discontinued.
As these strategies have not yet been devised it is not possible to quantify the impact.
