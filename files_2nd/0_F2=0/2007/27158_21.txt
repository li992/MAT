Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2007 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with applicable UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 'UK GAAP' and with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies December 2005.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
The treasury share reserve was created in accordance with FRS 25: Financial  and Presentation and the Companies Act 1985.
The cost of any share bought back to be held in treasury or subsequent resale from treasury is deducted from or added to the treasury share reserve.
The financial statements for 2006 have been restated to disclose separately the treasury share reserve along with a number of related adjustments, none of which affects the net assets of the Company.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an exdividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are recognised as a capital item in the Income Statement.
expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
Murray Income Trust PLC 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and the revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year.
e Valuation of Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchange's electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net return for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company's financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Company's activities.
During the year the Company entered into two embedded short call options and one yield enhanced security.
Details of these are provided in the Portfolio of Investments table on page 22.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of the investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement ii interest rate risk iii liquidity risk and iv credit risk.
In line with the Company's investment objective, the portfolio comprises UK securities and therefore has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
In order to mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
It is the Boards' policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown on page 7.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairman's Statement on page 11 and in the Investment Manager's Review on pages 15 to 18.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of Murray Income Trust PLC 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued the risks.
The Board has agreed the level of gearing, which was 5.7% of net assets as at 30 June 2007 2006 -5.4%.
The Manager's policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numerical disclosures in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Company's investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out on page 2.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowing powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Manager's Review on pages 15 to 18.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Board's policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 12 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 13 and 14.
Interest rate risk Financial assets The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Floating rate Interest bearing Non-interest bearing 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Sterling 2,073 100 15,666 7,992 527,603 472,719 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.

Liquidity risk The Company's assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Managers reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Manager's research of potential investee companies.
