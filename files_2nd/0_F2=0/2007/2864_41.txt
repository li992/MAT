Under this scheme awards are made annually consisting of Deferred Shares, which are linked to the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme details of which are contained in the Directors remuneration report and Matching Shares.
The value of Deferred Shares is determined by the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme: half of the annual bonus is paid in cash and the remainder is compulsorily deferred on a gross basis into Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares are held for a period of three years from the date of award during which they are not forfeitable, except in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
A conditional award of Matching Shares is made at the same time as the award of Deferred Shares.
Participants will be eligible to receive up to 1.5 Matching Shares for every Deferred Share.
Matching Shares will vest after the three year holding period to the extent to which performance conditions have been met.
33.3% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 6% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 16% per annum.
The performance condition attached to the awards may be amended by the Group Remuneration Committee, a sub-committee of the Group Board, from time to time, subject to the new condition being no less demanding than the original condition.
