Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided at the average rate of tax expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to reflect the time value of money.
g Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including interest payable, premiums on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
h Preference stocks Under FRS 25 preference and preferred ordinary stock are now classified as debt previously included within Capital and Reserves as non equity interests.
The dividends associated with the preference and preferred ordinary stock are charged fully to the Companys revenue return within finance costs.
i Dividends payable to equity shareholders Under FRS 21 dividends should not be accrued in the accounts unless they have been approved by shareholders before the balance sheet date.
Interim dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds once they have been paid to shareholders.
