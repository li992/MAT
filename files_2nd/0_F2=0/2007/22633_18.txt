Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General Information Collins Stewart plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given in the Company Information on the Inside Back Cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 3 and in the Operating and Financial Review on 12 to 23.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The consolidated financial statements of Collins Stewart plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The effective date of transition to IFRSs from UK GAAP was 1 January 2005.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures came into effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
This standard and the related amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements introduce new disclosures relating to financial instruments and management of capital.
They do not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to other types of asset or liability, such as taxation.
These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements have been presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations have been included in accordance with the policies set out below.
The financial statements are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand expressed as millions to one decimal place m, except where otherwise indicated.
The Group has chosen not to early adopt the following standards and interpretations that were issued but not yet effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2007: IFRS 8: Operating Segments: IFRIC 11, IFRS 2: Group Treasury Share Transactions: IFRIC 12: Service Concession Arrangements: IFRIC 13: Customer Loyalty Programmes: and IFRIC 14, IAS 19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The directors anticipate that the application of these new standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group in the period of initial application.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue Revenue, which excludes value added tax, includes the profit on buying and selling securities, the profit or loss arising on positions held in securities, gross commissions, brokerage, fees earned and subscriptions for information sales.
Dividends and interest arising on long and short positions in securities form part of revenue, and, as they are also reflected in movements in market prices, are not identified separately.
Fee income is recognised when the related services are completed and the income is considered receivable.
Revenue also includes the net returns on managing segregated client money accounts, accrued on a time basis.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established.
Operating Profit Operating profit is stated after interest income directly related to investment business but before other interest income.
Investment in Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but does not control or jointly-control, through participation in the financial and operating policies and decisions of the investee.
56 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 The results, assets and liabilities of associates are included in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associate in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair value of identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in the profit and loss in the year of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of impairment of the assets transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Interests in Joint Ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Where a Group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the Groups share of jointly-controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant company and classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred in respect of interests in jointlycontrolled assets are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Income from the sale or use of the Groups share of the output of jointly-controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to from the Group and the income can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements, which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venture has an interest, are referred to as jointly-controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly-controlled entities using proportionate consolidation the Groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly-controlled entities are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
It is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or where such other occasions or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary is presented separately in the balance sheet.
Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 57 Reports and Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment.
Other Intangible Assets Software and Software Development Costs An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups software development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development costs of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where the above conditions are not met costs are expensed as incurred.
Software purchased or developed Software licences Useful life Finite Finite Amortised over Method used Three years straight-line life of licences Internally generated Internally generated or acquired and acquired Acquired Impairment testing Method reviewed at Method reviewed at recoverable amount testing each financial year-end each financial year-end Acquired Separately or from a Business Combination Other intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The useful lives of those intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Where amortisation is charged on finite assets, this expense is taken to the income statement through administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Property, Plant and Equipment Freehold land is stated at cost.
Buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
58 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Fixtures and fittings and equipment 10% 33% pa Leasehold land and buildings Over the period of the lease Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 1% pa The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets with finite lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, as may be the case for assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on trade date and derecognised on either trade date, if applicable, or on maturity or repayment.
On initial recognition, IAS 39 requires that financial instruments be classified into the following categories: at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-tomaturity investments or available for sale.
The Group does not hold any assets that are classified as held-to-maturity investments.
Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 59 Reports and Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss This category comprises financial assets held for trading, defined as those primarily acquired for the purpose of selling in the short term, and any financial assets that are designated as fair value through profit and loss on inception.
These financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, with the transaction costs recorded immediately in the income statement and are subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value or on derecognition are recognised in the income statement as net trading income.
Interest and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in trading income.
Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in active markets.
Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value, including any transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate is that which exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount.
Available-for-sale Investments Available-for-sale investments comprise non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as available for sale on initial recognition or are not classified into the categories described above.
Available-for-sale investments include loans that do not meet the criteria for classification as loans and receivables as they are quoted in an active market.
They are initially recognised at fair value, including direct and incremental transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity until the financial asset is sold, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
Interest determined using the effective interest rate method, impairment losses and translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Determination of Fair Value The fair value of quoted investments in active markets is based on current bid or offer prices, as appropriate.
For investments where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the investment or the net asset base.
Financial Liabilities Except for derivatives and held-for-trading investments, which are classified as at fair value through profit and loss on initial recognition, all financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
60 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Derecognition of Financial Assets The Group derecognises financial assets when: the contractual rights to cash flows arising from a financial asset has expired: or it transfers the financial asset including substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset: or it transfers the financial asset, neither retaining nor transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but no longer retains control of the asset.
Impairment of Financial Assets Assets carried at amortised cost are assessed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Impairment losses are incurred if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of the asset, and that event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired includes observable data about the following loss events: significant financial difficulty of the issuer: a breach of contract, such as default or delinquency in interest or principal repayment: granting to the borrower a concession, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, that the lender would not otherwise consider: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
Investments in Securities Investments in securities are recognised and derecognised on a trade-date basis where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned.
They are measured initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss,  transaction costs.
Derivatives Derivatives are measured initially at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted prices prevailing in active markets, including recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are included as assets when their fair value is positive, and liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Settlement Balances Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase of and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the deal are settled, and the Group is exposed to risk in the event that one side of the transaction remains unmatched.
The amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross within trade debtors or trade creditors as appropriate.
Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 61 Reports and Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Securities Borrowing Securities are borrowed in the ordinary course of business.
All borrowing is collateralised and such collateral is included in trade debtors.
Interest-bearing Loans and Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Client Money The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Services Authority and other regulatory bodies.
Such money and the corresponding liabilities to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet, as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
The amounts held on behalf of clients at the balance sheet date are stated in note 33.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits, which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly-liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Equity Instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement, except for differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair values are recognised in equity.
62 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and movements in deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Operating Leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Retirement Benefit Costs Defined contributions made to employees personal pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account as and when incurred.
Share-based Payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equitysettled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled, share-based payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued is determined using either a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs Dividends have been waived by the trustees of the Collins Stewart plc ESOT and the Collins Stewart CI Limited ESOT, but not the Hawkpoint ESOT or the Collins Stewart Inc ESOT, on shares which have not yet vested unconditionally pursuant to employee awards.
Shares which have not yet vested unconditionally pursuant to employee awards are excluded from the denominator in the earnings per share calculation.
Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the principal area of judgment that has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the carrying value of goodwill.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating units and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The calculation has resulted in no impairment being recognised during 2007 or 2006.
64 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 3. Business and Geographic Segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into four operating divisions: Securities, Capital Markets, Wealth Management and Hawkpoint.

Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 77 Reports and Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19.1 Credit Risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
As a large proportion of the Groups business is contracted on a matched principal basis, the main credit risk is more akin to market risk, as the exposure in such cases is to movements in security prices.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The following table discloses the maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets.
Trade and other receivables Other debtors Delivery Other and Other Cash Other versus trade accrued financial Trading and cash intangible payment debtors income assets investments equivalents assets Total m m m m m m m m At 31 December 2007 438.1 24.0 23.4 2.0 34.1 158.8 1.3 681.7 At 31 December 2006 308.0 24.8 23.8 9.6 21.1 133.0 520.3 The Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the period between the trade date and the settlement date.
This period is generally three business days but can be longer in some markets.
In addition, the Group has credit exposure that extends beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities.
The majority of these transactions are with financial institutions.
Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty.
They could however be sold in the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of delivery versus payment trade debtors.
Consequently the risk exposure is effectively to an adverse movement in market prices from the time of purchase and sale respectively.
Risk exposure in relation to cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by placing deposits across a number of large banks with strong credit ratings.

The Group makes markets in smaller company stocks, Australian securities, investment trusts and fixed interest securities, primarily in order to facilitate liquidity in the securities of clients to whom it acts as market maker, broker or adviser.
These positions are carried in current assets and liabilities at fair value.
Limits are set on the size of individual and aggregate positions.
Day-to-day risk monitoring is undertaken by senior management.
In addition, as an intermediary, the Group acts on an agency or matched principal basis so its exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails to fulfil its obligations.
The impact of these risks is minimised by strict limits and monitoring controls.

Share-based Payments The Group has a number of share incentive plans for granting of non-transferable options to certain employees and executives.
Options granted under the plans normally vest on the first day on which they become exercisable, which is typically three to four years after grant date.
The maximum life of an option is 10 years.
These options are normally settled in equity once exercised and, dependent on the option scheme, are settled either with new shares issued or shares purchased in the market.
The following table summarises the share option schemes that existed during the 12 months to 31 December 2006 and 12 months to 31 December 2007 respectively and the estimated fair values of the options granted.
