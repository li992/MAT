Notes to the Accounts 1 Statement of significant accounting policies a Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. b Basis of accounts The accounts are presented in sterling and amounts are disclosed rounded to the nearest 100,000, unless otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these accounts.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures have been adopted for the first time in these accounts, introducing new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
Neither these nor any other standards becoming effective in 2007 have any further impact on the Groups financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these accounts are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
c Basis of consolidation The Group accounts incorporate the results of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
Control is assumed where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
d Investment in joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group exerts joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group accounts for its investments in its jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under this method the investment is initially recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted to reflect the Groups share of the net profit or loss of the joint venture.
The Groups share of joint venture results is included in a single line item in the income statement.
e Goodwill On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The balance is reviewed for impairment at least annually with impairment being recognised immediately in the income statement.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a property disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
f Investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased under finance leases by the Group which are held either for long-term rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost including related transaction costs and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
The basis of valuation of properties is described in note 12.
In accordance with IAS 40: Investment Property, investment property held under a finance lease is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and, in the case of investment properties under development, capitalised interest, certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of the developments under construction.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property measured at fair value through the income statement.
Borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised using the Groups weighted average cost of the relevant borrowings.
Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date when the property is physically complete and becomes available for occupation.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
31 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Statement of significant accounting policies continued g Development properties Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classified as development properties and stated at fair value.
Changes in fair value above cost are recognised in equity and changes in fair value below cost are recognised in the income statement.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When development properties are completed, they are reclassified as investment properties and any accumulated revaluation surplus or deficit is transferred to retained earnings.
h Plant and equipment Plant and equipment comprise computers, motor vehicles, furniture, fixtures and fittings and improvements to Group offices.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives are computers 3 years: motor vehicles 4 years: furniture 10 years: fixtures and fittings 10 years and improvements to Group offices 10 years.
i Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and written down accordingly.
j Leases Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as a lessee In accordance with IAS 40, leases of investment property are assessed on a property by property basis.
The Groups investment properties are accounted for as finance leases and are recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Lease payments, where material, are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as lessor Assets leased out under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant rate of return on net investment.
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in investment property, with rental income recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits granted as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
k Financial instruments Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at invoiced value, if that is not materially different from fair value, less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash and short term deposits Cash and short term deposits comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks, other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised at invoiced amount.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps in order to manage the risks arising from its activities as described in more detail in the Financial Review on pages 8 to 10 and in note 18.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are remeasured to fair value as calculated by the counterparties based on market prices at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments and hence any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the income statement as a finance cost.
l Pension costs The obligations of defined benefit pension schemes, representing benefits accruing to employees, are measured at discounted present value while scheme assets are measured at their fair value.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of the employees concerned and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions or changes to those assumptions are recognised in full in the year in which they occur immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
32 1 Statement of significant accounting policies continued m Revenue recognition Revenue comprises rental income of the Groups investment properties.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants are netted off against property outgoings.
Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore also recognised on the same, straight-line basis.
Surrender premiums received in the period from tenants vacating the property before the end of the lease are included in rental income.
A property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally on unconditional exchange of contracts.
For conditional exchanges, sales are recognised as the conditions are satisfied.
n Share and share-based remuneration The cost of equity settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised in the income statement as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the individuals concerned become fully entitled to the award.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The charge is reversed if it appears likely that the performance criteria will not be met.
The fair value of share options awarded has been calculated, based on advice from New Bridge Street Consultants, using a stochastic option valuation model.
o Income tax The charge for current UK corporation tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
p Exceptional items Non-recurring expenses and gains recognised outside the normal course of business are classified as exceptional and are identified separately in the financial statements.
2 Net rental income The Group engages in only one class of business activity, being property investment.
All operations are continuing and are located in the UK.
All properties are industrial in nature.
Net rental income 2007 2006 m m Gross rental income 82.0 88.8 Service charge and other income 7.0 6.3 Gross property income 89.0 95.1 Property outgoings 16.5 16.1 Net rental income 72.5 79.0 The exceptional net rental expense in 2006 of 1.3m relates to the write-off of lease incentives and letting fees following the disposal of 84 properties to Dunedin Property Limited.
33 Notes to the Accounts continued 3 Exceptional administration expenses The exceptional administration expenses in 2006 of 1.3m relate to an exceptional charge to the defined benefit pension scheme in respect of past service costs of 1.0m and professional fees incurred in respect of the Groups conversion to a REIT of 0.3m.
4 Loss arising on sale of properties and subsidiary undertakings The loss arising on sale of properties and subsidiary undertakings is calculated by reference to book value at the date of sale.
In 2007 the loss arising on sale included an exceptional goodwill impairment charge of 0.3m for goodwill attached to properties disposed 2006: 13.1m.
5 Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging crediting the following: 2007 2006 m m Staff costs see note 6 10.7 13.1 Less own work capitalised 2.7 2.4 8.0 10.7 Depreciation 0.6 0.6 Goodwill impairment 0.3 13.3 Operating lease payments 0.8 0.7 Auditors remuneration for audit services - Group 0.2 0.2 - Subsidiaries 0.2 0.2 Amounts payable to Ernst & Young LLP during the year in respect of non-audit services totalled 38,000 2006: 20,000, which related to other advice.
The non-audit fees are considered to be immaterial and do not impair the auditors independence.

At 31 December 2007 the notional amount outstanding under fixed interest rate receivable swaps was 635m 2006: 635m used to swap the Groups Eurosterling Bonds into floating rate.
The notional amount outstanding under fixed interest rate payable swaps at 31 December 2007 was 330m 2006: 225m.
The notional amount outstanding under capped interest rate payable swaps at 31 December 2007 was 180m 2006: 130m.
The effect of these swaps is included in the interest rate analysis in note 17.
The fair value of swaps entered into is set out in note 19.
These amounts are based on market value at the balance sheet dates.
Market rate sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the income statement and net assets to a 0.5% change in floating interest rates on the Companys financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: i the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments as debt and deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: ii the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: 0.5% 0.5% decrease in increase in interest rates interest rates m m At 31 December 2007 Decrease increase in fair value of financial instruments 7.0 4.8 Impact on net interest payable gain loss 1.5 1.5 Total impact on net income and net assets 5.5 3.3 At 31 December 2006 Decrease increase in fair value of financial instruments 0.9 6.8 Impact on net interest payable gain loss 1.4 1.4 Total impact on net income and net assets 0.5 5.4 40 19 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 Book Fair Fair value Book Fair Fair value value value adjustment value value adjustment m m m m m m Financial assets Cash and short-term deposits 6.3 6.3 145.5 145.5 Trade and other receivables 26.5 26.5 33.5 33.5 Total financial assets 32.8 32.8 179.0 179.0 Financial liabilities Eurosterling bond 2010 274.4 277.8 3.4 274.2 278.6 4.4 Eurosterling bond 2015 149.3 140.8 8.5 149.2 144.2 5.0 Eurosterling bond 2019 209.7 201.3 8.4 209.7 215.5 5.8 Other loans and overdrafts 177.0 177.0 810.4 796.9 13.5 633.1 638.3 5.2 Interest rate derivatives 34.9 34.9 23.8 23.8 Trade and other payables 48.1 48.1 50.2 50.2 Total financial liabilities 893.4 879.9 13.5 707.1 712.3 5.2 Total net financial liabilities 860.6 847.1 13.5 528.1 533.3 5.2 Fair value on a post tax basis 13.5 3.6 Fair values have been calculated by using market values at the balance sheet date.
The market values of derivatives and borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of short-term deposits is assumed to approximate to their book values.
The Groups only obligation is to repay its bonds and loans at par value on the maturity dates.
Sterling loans of 92.3m 2006: 91.5m have been made by Group companies to joint ventures.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the attained age method.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Industrious Scheme, in respect of employees who transferred with the Industrious Group in 2005.
This scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and was closed to new entrants on 2 July 1999.
Contributions are invested in funds managed by Legal & General Investment Management Limited.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of plan assets and of the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the Industrious Scheme was carried out as at 1 July 2007 by a qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The valuations for both schemes have been updated using the projected unit credit method to 31 December 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.
