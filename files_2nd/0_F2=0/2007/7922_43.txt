The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies and is approved by the Board.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash deposits, bank loans, convertible bonds and other borrowings.
a Foreign exchange risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts where appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2007 2006 2007 2006 $000 $000 $000 $000 UK Sterling 1,721 330 133 58,578 US Dollars 15,094 - - - Kazakhstan Tenge - - 93 74 At the year end 31 December 2007, the Group had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currencies of UK Sterling, US Dollar, Russian Rouble and Kazakhstan Tenge.
The Group has an exposure to US Dollars because the functional currency of its Russian subsidiaries in Russian Roubles.
A change in the US Dollar: Russia Rouble exchange rate will therefore result in a foreign exchange gain or loss on the US Dollar denominated balances in these subsidiaries.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of foreign currencies has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2007.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items largely result from trade payables and receivables, and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the US dollar strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the US dollar against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
If the US$ had gained lost 10% against all currencies significant to the Group at 31 December 2007 income would have been US$1.7 million higher lower 2006: US$5.8 million lower higher.
There is no material effect on equity reserve other than those relating directly to movements in the income statement.
b Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
Deposits earn interest by reference to Libor.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 0.5% increase or decrease is used for internal reporting to management of the assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss for the year ended 31 December 2007 would increase decrease by US$167,000 2006: decrease increase by US$191,000.
This is wholly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rate on its variable rate net cash and borrowings.
c Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group feels that it has mitigated the risk of financial loss as the majority of oil sales are prepaid, whereas as non prepaid sales are receivable within 15 days of delivery of goods to the counterparty.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
The Groups financial assets comprise trade receivables and bank deposits.
The credit risk on bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international creditrating agencies.
d Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced to identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group.
To date, the Group has relied on shareholder funding, bank loans and convertible bonds to finance its operations.
The Group has no undrawn borrowing facilities at 31 December 2007.
