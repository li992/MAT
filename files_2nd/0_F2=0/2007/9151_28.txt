The provision is based on the value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
The provisions are not discounted as, given the length of the remaining leases, the impact is not considered material.
The other provision relates to B&Qs decision to terminate a contract in the prior year with its previous supplier of consumer credit services.
This gave rise to the repayment of part of the original proceeds received on disposal of Time Retail Finance in 2003.
The contract was held by Kingfisher plc on behalf of B&Q and therefore the provision was held by the Company.
This was paid during the year.
9 Net pension liability The Company participates in both a funded defined benefit scheme and a funded defined contribution scheme.
The total pension charge in the profit and loss account for the UK defined contribution scheme was 0.1m 2006: 0.1m.
Defined benefit schemes With reference to the defined benefit scheme, the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, Kingfisher plc is one of a member of Group companies that participate in the scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities.
The valuation of the scheme used for FRS 17 has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Groups UK scheme at 31 March 2004 and has been updated to 3 February 2007.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 97 9 Net pension liability continued The amounts included in the balance sheet, within the net pension liability, arising from the Companys obligations in respect of its defined benefit retirement scheme, are determined as follows: millions 2007 2006 Present value of defined benefit obligations 45.9 41.0 Fair value of scheme assets 45.1 35.1 Net liability 0.8 5.9 Related deferred tax asset 0.2 1.8 0.6 4.1 The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out as at 3 February 2007.
The principal actuarial assumptions and expected rates of return used were as follows: Annual % rate 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.3 4.7 Salary escalation 4.5 4.3 Rate of pension increases 2.9 2.7 Price inflation 2.9 2.7 % rate of return 2007 2006 Equities 7.8 7.6 Bonds 4.9 4.2 Property 6.3 5.9 Other 3.9 3.7 Overall expected rate of return 6.5 6.1 The overall expected rate of return is effectively a weighted average of the individual asset categories and their inherent expected rates of return.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 1m, and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 0.03m.
The assumptions for pensioner longevity are based on an analysis of pensioner death trends under the scheme over the period from 1998 to 2004, together with allowances for future improvements to death rates for all members.
The specific tables used are the same as those used in the 2004 funding valuation, namely PMA92C2010 for male pensioners, PFA92C2010 2 year age rating for female pensioners.
Further allowances for improving longevity are included for members yet to retire.
At 3 February 2007 the Company has further strengthened the assumption for future improvements to mortality rates implying an increase in the assumed life expectancies.
This has the impact of increasing the defined benefit obligation by 4% compared with that using the previous mortality rate projections.
These revised assumptions are equivalent to assuming the average age at death for a pensioner currently aged 60 is 85.1 for a male and 86.3 for a female.
They are also equivalent to assuming an average age at death for a member aged 60 in 15 years time is 86.2 for a male and 87.5 for a female.
These assumptions will be reviewed following the next funding valuation due no later than as at 31 March 2007.
The amounts recognised in the profit and loss account are as follows: millions 2007 2006 Amounts charged to operating profit: Current service cost 1.1 0.9 Total operating charge 1.1 0.9 Amounts credited charged to other finance costs: Expected return on pension scheme assets 2.3 1.7 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 2.2 1.8 Net interest return cost 0.1 0.1 Total charged to the profit and loss account 1.0 1.0 The actual return on pension scheme assets was as follows: millions 2007 2006 Actual return on pension scheme assets 7.1 5.4 98 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 9 Net pension liability continued Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations in the balance sheet are as follows: Obligations: millions 2007 2006 Defined benefit obligation at beginning of year 41.0 35.6 Total service cost charged in the profit and loss account 1.1 0.9 Interest cost 2.2 1.8 Actuarial losses 2.8 4.9 Contributions paid by employees 0.4 0.4 Benefits paid 1.6 2.6 Defined benefit obligation at end of year 45.9 41.0 Movements in the fair value of scheme assets in the balance sheet are as follows: Assets: millions 2007 2006 Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 35.1 26.6 Expected return of pension scheme assets 2.3 1.7 Actuarial gains 4.8 3.7 Contributions paid by employer 4.1 5.3 Contributions paid by employees 0.4 0.4 Benefits paid 1.6 2.6 Fair value of plan assets at end of year 45.1 35.1 The total net actuarial gains and losses for the year ended 3 February 2007 was a gain of 2.0m 2006: loss of 1.2m.

Group employees, including directors, are granted contingent share awards under the Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme as part of their annual performance award.
During the year the Group made its first contingent share awards under the Performance Share Plan and the Kingfisher Retention Plan.
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes was made in April 2003.
Under these Schemes, participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group.
These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant up to the tenth anniversary, except where the performance condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly.
The performance conditions for all options have now been met, except for the grant made in April 2003.
On the exercise of Phantom Options, participants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of notional shares in the Company.
100 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 13 Share options continued All permanent employees excluding those receiving Executive Options were each granted options over 529 shares in both 1997 and 1998, provided that they were employed as at 19 March 1997 and in employment on the date of grant.
These options were granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under the UK ShareSave Scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into Inland Revenue approved savings contracts for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option price has been the average market price over three days shortly before an offer to subscribe, discounted by 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
The International ShareSave Plan, which operates along the lines of the UK ShareSave Scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations.
There are 11,826 employees in ShareSave Schemes, of which 71 are in the International Plan at 3 February 2007.
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
In total 15 executive directors and members of senior management held various options as at 3 February 2007.
The Company has not repeated the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 32 of the Kingfisher plc consolidated financial statements.
