Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Share-based payment transactions continued The charge to operating profit before exceptional items for the year is 1.1 million 2006: 0.8 million, representing one third of the estimated total cost of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 share awards.
The maximum number of shares which could vest as a result of Ltip awards is as follows: 2007 2006 At 1 January 3,189,896 1,906,057 Awards made in the year 1,204,407 1,321,563 Vested during the year - - Lapsed during the year 110,214 37,724 At 31 December 4,284,089 3,189,896 The charge to exceptional items was determined by evaluating the effect of increasing the number of shares likely to vest up to the maximum, and shortening the vesting periods of the awards from three years to the elapsed time between the grant dates and the anticipated date of the completion of the takeover.
In addition, as the decision of the Remuneration Committee constitutes a modification to the awards, fair values of the awards both immediately before and immediately after the modification have been determined by an independent valuer.
The difference between these fair values is being charged to the income statement over the period from the date of modification 17 October 2007 until the anticipated date of the completion of the takeover.
The total exceptional charge was 1.7m.
See note 29 for events after the balance sheet date.

The largest schemes are directly invested and others are invested in insurance contracts.
The remainder are unfunded schemes.
The German scheme has been disclosed separately as it represents a large proportion of the unfunded liabilities.

The results of these valuations were updated to 31 December 2007 by independent qualified actuaries.
