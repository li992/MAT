Foseco plc Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 18 Long term incentive plan continued As Foseco's shares had traded for only a short period from the date of the Company's flotation to the dates of the share awards, expected share price volatilities have been estimated by reference to the experience in recent years of newly listed companies and long-established companies in similar sectors.
The historical share price volatility is not yet sufficiently well established to serve as a reasonable guide to expected volatility.
The charge to operating profit before exceptional items for the year was 1.1 million 2006: 0.8 million, representing one third of the estimated total cost of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 share awards The maximum number of shares which could vest as a result of Ltip awards is as follows: 2007 2006 m m At 1 January 3,189,896 1,906,057 Awards made in the year 1,204,407 1,321,563 Vested during the year - - Lapsed during the year 110,214 37,724 At 31 December 4,284,089 3,189,896 The charge to exceptional items was determined by evaluating the effect of increasing the number of shares likely to vest up to the maximum, and shortening the vesting periods of the awards from three years to the elapsed time between the grant dates and the anticipated date of the completion of the takeover.
In addition, as the decision of the Remuneration Committee constitutes a modification to the awards, fair values of the awards both immediately before and immediately after the modification have been determined by an independent valuer.
The difference between these fair values is being charged to the income statement over the period from the date of modification 17 October 2007 until the anticipated date of the completion of the takeover.
The total exceptional charge was 1.7m.
