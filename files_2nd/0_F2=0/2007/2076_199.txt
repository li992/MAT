2 The following information in respect of Mr Salamons retirement benefits, quoted as at 30 June 2007, is presented to satisfy the requirements of Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985: At 30 June 2007, the total annual pension entitlement is US$27,852, with a corresponding transfer value of US$740,496.
The decrease compared with Mr Salamons entitlements immediately prior to his retirement is due to the fact that he took the majority of his pension entitlement as a one-off cash payment upon retirement.
The decrease in the accrued annual pension entitlement compared with 30 June 2006, after making allowance for inflation of 4.3 per cent, is US$999,070.
The transfer value of this decrease is US$15,974,904.
The majority of the decrease is attributable to the fact that most of the benefit was taken as a cash lump sum.
For FY2006, the decrease in the accrued pension, after making an allowance for inflation of 3.3 per cent, is US$2,532.
The transfer value of the decrease is US$41,149.
3 Increase is primarily due to early retirement.
