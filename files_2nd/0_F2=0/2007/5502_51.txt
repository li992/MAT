The ESOP trust, which was established in 1994, purchased shares in Enodis plc to meet some of the future obligations under employee option schemes.
Shares are distributed to specified employees upon their exercise of certain options and payment by them of the exercise price.
The Group finances the ESOP trust by way of an interest free loan of 2.0m.
The ESOP trust has waived the right to receive dividends on all shares held.
Costs are borne by Enodis plc and are written-off in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency translation reserve the reserve represents the currency realignment that arises on the translation of interests in the opening net assets of overseas subsidiary entities and associated undertakings, long-term foreign borrowings used to finance overseas investments, and on the translation of the profit and loss account for the period to the closing foreign exchange rate.
Hedging reserve The Group applies hedge accounting, as defined in IAS39 see note 22.
Gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Gains and losses are released to profit and loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts earnings.
Other reserves include the Groups reserve for share options where a charge for the option has been recognised but the option has yet to be exercised and the capital redemption reserve in respect of the cancellation of 40.2m shares, with a nominal value of 4.0m, arising from the Groups share buy-back programme.
27 Share-based payments The Group has two share option schemes in place for certain employees with outstanding grants as follows: Executive Share Scheme 1995 : Executive Share Scheme 2001.
During 2007, the Group also made two grants under a new performance share plan which was approved by shareholders at the last AGM.
Exercises of the awards under the Groups share option schemes and performance share plan are generally settled by using new shares of Enodis plc.
