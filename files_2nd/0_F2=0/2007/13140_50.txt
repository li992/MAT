Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 121 19 Financial instruments Details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by Reed Elsevier in relation to financial instruments are set out on pages 31 to 33 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Reed Elsevier maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set off.

The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises 170m 2006: 176m in relation to fair value hedges, 28m 2006: 42m in relation to cash flow hedges and 12m 2006: 1m held for trading.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities held for trading comprise interest rate derivatives and forward foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments.
At 31 December 2007, Reed Elsevier had access to 1,502m 2006: 1,529m of committed bank facilities that expire in two to three years, of which 42m 2006: 39m was drawn.
These facilities principally provide back up for short term borrowings.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2007, and after utilising available cash resources excluding 1,933m of cash received from the part disposal of Harcourt Education which was included in the special distribution to shareholders of the parent companies in January 2008, no borrowings mature in the next two years 2006: nil : 27% of borrowings mature in the third year 2006: 25% : 29% in the fourth and fifth years 2006: 24% : 31% in the sixth to tenth years 2006: 37% : and 13% beyond the tenth year 2006: 14%.
Market Risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2007, after adjusting for 1,933m of cash received from the part disposal of Harcourt Education which was included in the special distribution to shareholders of the parent companies in January 2008, 69% of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 7m 2006: 3m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2007.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 7m 2006: 3m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2007 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of 10m 2006: 9m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 10m 2006: 8m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than sterling, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 25.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2007 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 262m 2006: 341m.
This would be offset to a large degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 123m 2006: 197m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2007 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding borrowings, by 328m 2006: 423m and increase net borrowings by 150m 2006: 241m.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 106m 2006: 40m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 130m 2006: 49m.
Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 123 19 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the balance sheet.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made.
Past due up to one month 234m 2006: 336m : past due two to three months 78m 2006: 111m : past due four to six months 26m 2006: 46m : and past due greater than six months 21m 2006: 25m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the credit worthiness of the customer and where the history of dealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS39 Financial Instruments are described below: Fair value hedges Reed Elsevier has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 820m were in place at 31 December 2007 2006: 839m swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD, euros and Swiss francs CHF to floating rate USD debt for the whole or part of their term.
Combined financial statements 124 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 19 Financial instruments continued The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges, which are included in the income statement, for the two years ended 31 December 2007 were as follows: Fair value Fair value 1 January movement Exchange 1 January movement Exchange 31 December Gains losses on borrowings 2006 gain loss gain loss 2007 gain loss gain loss 2007 and related derivatives m m m m m m m USD debt 15 15 1 1 16 15 Related interest rate swaps 15 15 1 1 16 15 Euro debt 104 26 14 116 35 2 149 Related Euro to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 105 26 14 117 34 2 149 1 1 1 CHF debt 53 10 7 56 49 1 6 Related CHF to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 54 10 7 57 50 1 6 1 1 1 Total USD, Euro and CHF debt 172 21 22 171 2 3 170 Total related interest rate derivatives 174 21 22 173 3 170 Net gain 2 2 2 All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2007.
A fair value loss of 2m 2006: nil has been included within finance costs.
During 2007, no 2006: 3m fair value losses recognised on adoption of IAS39 Financial Instruments were included in finance income.
Cash flow hedges Reed Elsevier enters into two types of cash flow hedge: 1 Interest rate derivatives which fix the interest expense on a portion of forecast floating rate denominated debt including commercial paper, short term bank loans and floating rate term debt.
2 Foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Elsevier science and medical businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve pre-tax in 2007 and 2006, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were as follows: Total Foreign hedge Transition Interest rate exchange reserve loss hedges hedges pre-tax m m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2006: gains losses deferred 5 12 7 Gains arising in 2006 1 53 54 Amounts recognised in income statement 3 3 14 8 Exchange translation differences 1 1 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2007: gains losses deferred 2 45052 Gains losses arising in 2007 11 14 3 Amounts recognised in income statement 2 1 30 29 Exchange translation differences 22 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2007: gains losses deferred 8 36 28 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2007.
A tax charge of 8m 2006: 15m in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2007 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
