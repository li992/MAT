The Fund Manager, Jeremy Tigue, who is an employee of F&C, had a beneficial interest in 279,220 ordinary shares of the Company at 31 December 2007 and 281,204 at 7 March 2008.
26 Financial Risk Management The Company is an Investment Company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an Investment Trust under the provisions of S842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1988.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of publicly listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and private equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management, as set out in detail in the Business Review.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The Accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value, except as noted in d below and in note 17 in respect of Debenture Stocks.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market Risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Board sets policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective and meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors on-going market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates.
Debenture stocks were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
All contracts and compliance with them, including the Debenture trust deed, are agreed and monitored by the Board.
Gearing may be short or long-term, in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
Income earned in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
Report and Accounts 2007 57 Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management continued Currency exposure The fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities at 31 December, by currency, are shown below.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2007 Average 2006 US Dollar 1.9906 1.9572 2.0023 1.3615 Euro 1.4842 1.4587 Yen 222.38 233.20 233.50 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying, at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on net asset value NAV per share: 2007 2006 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 309 468 142 442 133 550 Capital Return 72,806 26,041 10,608 51,538 37,160 10,687 73,115 26,509 10,750 Total Return 51,980 37,293 11,237 NAV per share pence 10.67 3.87 1.52 6.93 4.97 1.50 58 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued 2007 2006 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 309 468 142 442 133 550 Capital Return 72,806 26,041 10,608 51,538 37,160 10,687 Total Return 73,115 26,509 10,750 51,980 37,293 11,237 NAV per share pence 10.67 3.87 1.52 6.93 4.97 1.50 These analyses are broadly representative of the Companys activities during the current and prior year as a whole, although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
Interest Rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2007 2006 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash 32,910 32,910 28,153 28,153 Borrowings 92,220 92,220 68,000 68,000 Overdrafts Exposure to fixed rates Cash 110,575 110,575 Debentures 110,575 110,575 Other borrowings Net exposures At year end 59,310 110,575 169,885 39,847 110,575 150,422 Maximum in year 95,313 110,575 205,888 106,937 110,575 217,512 Minimum in year 27,426 110,575 83,149 8,299 110,575 118,874 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the make-up of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rates applying on the debenture stocks are set out in note 17 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the Debentures on which the interest rate is fixed.
The Debentures are valued in the accounts at par value.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have had the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV per share.
2007 2006 Increase in rate Decrease in rate Increase in rate Decrease in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 461 461 286 286 Capital return 922 922 680 680 Total return 1,383 1,383 966 966 NAV per share pence 0.20 0.20 0.13 0.13 Report and Accounts 2007 59 Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management continued Other Market Risk exposures The Company does not usually enter into derivative transactions in managing its exposure to other market risks.
The portfolio of investments, valued at 2,664,514,000 at 31 December 2007 2006: 2,578,696,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in note 16 on the accounts.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the Income Statement Capital Return after tax and on the net asset value NAV per share: 2007 2006 Increase in value Decrease in value Increase in value Decrease in valaue 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 534,033 534,033 516,544 516,544 NAV per share pence 77.92 77.92 68.87 68.87 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments and share buy-backs.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio 680 at 31 December 2007 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio see note 16 : and the existence of an on-going loan facility agreement.
Cash balances are held with reputable banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Company does not normally invest in derivative products.
The manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 70m as set out in note 14 on the accounts.
The 11.25% Debenture Stock is governed by a trust deed and is redeemable in 2014 or at an earlier date or dates at the Companys behest.
The Perpetual Debenture Stock is also governed by a trust deed and is redeemable at par only on the security becoming enforceable.
The Board does not therefore consider the repayment of these debenture stocks as a likely short-term liquidity issue.
The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 2007 Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 92,220 92,220 Other creditors 14,320 14,320 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 106,540 110,575 217,115 2006 Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 68,000 68,000 Other creditors 29,335 29,335 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 97,335 110,575 207,910 60 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued c Credit Risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
The Board approves all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on a basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained and regularly reviewed by the Manager and the Board.
Broker and Stocklending counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Payments in respect of private equity investments are made only to counterparties with whom a contracted commitment exists.
Securities can only be loaned to third parties in exchange for collateral which exceeds the value of the securities throughout the duration of the loan.
Cash and deposits are held with reputable banks.
The Company has an on-going contract with its Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract is reviewed regularly.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
To the extent that F&C Management Limited F&C carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with management of F&C including the Fund Manager and with F&Cs Internal Audit function, which function carries out annual audits of F&Cs appointed sub-managers.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews F&Cs parent group annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report, Group Accounts and other public information indicative of its financial position and performance.
The Company has no credit-rated bonds or similar securities or derivatives in its portfolio at the year end 2006: same and does not normally invest in such.

The fair value of the debenture stocks, derived from their quoted market price at 31 December 2007, was 143,772,000 2006: 152,037,000.
Borrowings under loan facilities are short-term in nature and hence do not have a value materially different from their capital repayment amount.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at exchanges rates ruling at each valuation date.
Unquoted investments, including private equity investments, are valued based on professional assumptions and advice that is not wholly supported by prices from current market transactions or by observable market data.
The Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
With respect specifically to investments in private equity funds or partnerships, the Directors rely on valuations of the underlying unlisted investments as supplied by the managers of those private equity funds or partnerships.
The Directors regularly review the principles applied by the managers to those valuations to ensure they comply with the Companys accounting policies and with fair value principles.
e Capital Risk Management The Objective of the Company is stated as being to provide shareholders with long-term growth in capital and income.
In pursuing this long-term Objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.

This involves the ability to: issue and buy back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long term: and pay dividends to shareholders out of current year revenue earnings as well as out of brought forward revenue reserves.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 18 on the accounts.
Dividend payments are set out in note 10 on the accounts.
Borrowings are set out in notes 14 and 17 on the accounts.
