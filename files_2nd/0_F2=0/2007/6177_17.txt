Annual Report and Accounts 2007 56 57 Fair Value Estimation of Financial Instruments The fair value of publicly traded derivatives and trading and availablefor-sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
In assessing the fair value of non-traded derivatives and other financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each Balance Sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the specic or similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as option pricing models and estimated discounted value of future cash ows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The face value less any estimated credit adjustments for financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Key Assumptions and Estimates The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The Board has considered the critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the Accounts and concluded that the main area of significant risk which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is in respect of the assumptions used to calculate pension benets.
The assumptions include gilt yield at the year end, investment return including a risk margin over gilt yield, price and salary ination and mortality assumptions.
For example, a 0.25% change in the discount rate assumed could affect the shortfall position within the Scheme positively or negatively by over 9m and a one year increase in life expectancy would increase the liabilities by nearly 5.5m.
Full details of the assumptions used to calculate the pension assets and liabilities may be found in Note 32.
Impairment assumptions relating to Goodwill are as noted in Note 16.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees under a SAYE share option scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP schemes.
Underlying earnings are as dened in the Glossary.
Underlying earnings per share divides underlying earnings attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.

The valuations were incorporated into the accounts at 31st December 2007 with the resulting increase in fair value of 12.8m being taken to the Income Statement and 5.7m to reserves in relation to the transfer of property from operational land and buildings to investment property during the year.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of investment property.
The Groups investment properties were valued at 31st October 2005 by Bidwells, as Independent Valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS and the International Valuation Standards IVS1.
The valuation of each investment property was on the basis of Market Value, subject to the assumption that the investment properties would be sold subject to any existing leases.
The Market Value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Bidwells has assumed that each Port will continue to be operational and has made the special assumption that all investment properties are free from contamination and that any spillages or contamination will be removed by the tenant prior to the termination of the lease.
In accordance with the Valuation Standards, Bidwells confirms that, although it has carried out the valuation of the assets since 1991, it has not provided other property advice.
In relation to the rms preceding year the total fees paid by the Company as a percentage of the rms total fee income was less than 5%.
Bidwells maintains a policy of rotating valuers in accordance with Practice Statement 5.2.

Notes on the Accounts continued 16.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill of 26.4m and 1.5m has been allocated for impairment purposes to individual cash generating units CGUs, being two of the trading divisions of the Nordic Group Nordic Recycling Limited and Nordic Data Management Limited respectively.
The allocation was based on managements expectation of future economic benets from those CGUs, and is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.
The goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the significant synergies expected to arise after the Groups acquisition of Nordic.
The recoverable amount has been determined on a value in use basis.
The calculations are based on five year pre-tax cash ow projections approved by management.
Cash ows beyond the initial five year period are extrapolated using the growth rate below.
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are as follows: Assumption How Determined Revenue Estimated revenue has been based on management projections taking into account experience and minimum contracted revenue.
Operating margin Estimated operating margin has been based on management projections taking into account experience and changes in cost base following acquisition by the Group.
This includes operating costs and maintenance capital expenditure.
Growth rate Weighted average growth rate used is 2.25% which is consistent with the UKs long-term average growth in GDP.

Retirement benefit schemes In the past, the Group operated two pension schemes that covered the vast majority of employees: these schemes were merged during 2006.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The Nordic Group operates a dened contribution pension scheme.
At the start of 2006, the dened benefit schemes that the Group had established were as follows: Forth Ports PLC Pension Scheme Port of Tilbury London Limited Pension Fund These schemes provided benets that are linked to pay near retirement.
The assets of the schemes were held in separate funds that were administered by trustees.
These funds were held separately from the Company assets.
The pension cost relating to these schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualied actuary.
The latest formal actuarial assessments of the schemes were as at 5th April 2005.
The two schemes were merged from 1st July 2006.
The assets and liabilities of the Tilbury Fund were transferred to the Forth Ports Scheme, which was renamed The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme.
The actuaries have provided updated gures for the scheme as at 31st December 2007.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions which are listed below.
The total pension cost was 4.5m 2006 5.3m.
Member contributions are paid in addition.
A number of employees are members of The Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme FRDW scheme.
The Group also has a contractual relationship with self-employed pilots who operate within the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay to provide pilotage services.
The selfemployed pilots make payments into the Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF.
The FRDW scheme is a multi-employer dened benefit scheme which was set up many years ago on a national basis to provide pensions to Registered Dock Workers.
The most recent valuation of the FRDW scheme was carried out in 2005 which recorded a small surplus.
On an ongoing basis, it was fully funded.
The total assets and liabilities of the FRDW scheme are not assigned to specic employers.
All new employees joining the Group are entitled to join The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme: unless they are former Registered Dock Workers, they would not be entitled to join the FRDW scheme.
On the basis that the FRDW scheme is fully funded, the Group does not believe that it has any exposure to this pension scheme.
The employers are not entitled to participate in any surplus arising in the FRDW scheme.
The contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a dened contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.1m 2006 0.2m.
The Company and Port of Dundee Limited PODL are the Competent Harbour Authorities in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay respectively where they are responsible for the provision of pilotage services.
The pilotage services are provided by self-employed pilots.
The Company and PODL have no liability arising under the PNPF Scheme on an ongoing basis, however, they may have a liability for certain members if the PNPF is wound up.
Neither Company is aware of any such intention to wind up the Scheme.
The employer contributions to the dened contribution pension scheme operated by the Nordic Group of companies during the period that Nordic was part of the Forth Ports Group was 0.0m 2006 n a.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio and an allowance made for expected expenses.
This gave an assumed rate of 6.24% net of expenses at 31st December 2007.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31st December 2007 was 9.2m 2006 13.2m.
