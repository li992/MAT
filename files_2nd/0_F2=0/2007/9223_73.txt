The Company has an indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels division disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees is 1,228.1 million 2006: 1,228.9 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
These guarantees expire between 2009 and 2042 and the net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2007 is 635.8 million 2006: 658.9 million.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new leases being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of historic default data from internationally recognised credit-rating agencies and the credit profile of the counter party, HHC, to assess the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2007, the Company has recognised a financial liability of 10.0 million 2006: 14.0 million in respect of these guarantees together with a financial asset of 3.0 million 2006: 7.0 million in relation to the indemnity.
