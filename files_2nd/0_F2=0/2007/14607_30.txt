Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash generating units are based on values in use, which are calculated using cash flow projections for a fifteen year period.
The key assumptions in preparing the cash flow projections are discount rates, growth rates, and expected changes in margins.
The projections are based on business plans approved by management covering the three year period to March 2010, and assume inflationary growth in revenues with no margin improvement for the following twelve years.
A weighted average cost of capital of 8.8% has been used to determine the discounted net present value of the cash flows.
No impairment arose as a result of the valuations.
