Financial Risk Management Financial Risk Factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Market Risk a Foreign Exchange Risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, Euro, Swedish Krona and the UK pound.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency by using external forward foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial insitutions.
For segment reporting purposes, each subsidiary designates contracts with Group Treasury as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate.
External forward foreign exchange contracts are designated at Group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The Groups risk management policy is to hedge firm commitments and between 60% to 100% of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months.
Forecast transactions must be highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposurearising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
71 fide La Rue Annual Report 2007 14 Derivative Financial Instruments continued b Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
An analysis of net assets per geographical region is shown in note 2 to the accounts.
c Liquidity Risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
d Cash Flow and Fair Value Interest Rate Risk fide La Rues interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises principally from cash balances held.
Current low levels of borrowings are all at floating rate.
At higher levels of borrowings the policy is to manage the interest rate exposure through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
e Commodity Price Risk The Groups normal policy is to buy commodities at prevailing market prices under medium term supply contracts.
The Group has limited exposure to commodity price risk through the purchase of energy products.
Fair Value Estimation The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
In estimating fair values the Group makes assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
