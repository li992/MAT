On that date, the total number of shares in issue therefore reduced from 7,962,222,990 ordinary shares of 1p each to 796,222,299 ordinary shares of 10p each.
Shares reserved for issue under share options and awards As a consequence of the Rights issue, with effect from 15 June 2006 all options granted under the various share option schemes operated by the Company and awards granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP have, in accordance with the rules of the respective schemes and as approved by the HM Revenue and Customs where appropriate, been adjusted as follows: a the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted have been adjusted by the application of a multiplication factor of 1.07058 and the exercise price has been adjusted by a multiplication factor of 0.93406: and b the number of shares in each LTIP award has been adjusted by a multiplication factor of 1.07058.
Subsequently, as a consequence of the Share consolidation, with effect from 7 August 2006, the number of shares comprised in each option and award were divided by 10 and the exercise option prices were multiplied by 10.
All figures presented in the section below for the number of share options and awards, and the amounts for exercise prices and average prices have been restated to take into account the effects of the Rights issue and Share consolidation as noted above.

Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 123 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Share-based payment plans continued Long-term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to directors and senior executives at no or nominal cost.
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: a a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment unless the Company determines otherwise : b a conditional share award: or c a cash award granted in respect of a notional number of shares.
Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period.
For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years: for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: TSR test TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee with no retesting opportunities.
TSR must rank at the median position when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be available subject to the retention period, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved.
Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
If at least median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse.
The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant: and awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.

Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee after the completion of the first two years of the performance period.
Scheme use Given that no further awards can be granted under the LTIP after July 2008 it has been decided that a new share-based long-term incentive plan, to be known as the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP should be established.
Implementation of the LTIP is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 125 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Share-based payment plans continued Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan TBOP Grant details The Company introduced the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan TBOP in 2005 06 under which executives have the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus of up to 100% of their base salary in respect of any financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels of performance.
The TBOP operates in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan EBP.

Service requirements: release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006.
It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and including the financial year 2007 08.
However, as a result of the changes being made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007 08 onwards as detailed in the Remuneration report, the TBOP will cease to be operated one year early.
It is anticipated that the awards for the financial year 2006 07 will be granted in June 2007.
Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2007, the first year during which TBOP awards were granted, are detailed below: TBOP awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2007 Total number of awards granted 711,839 Exercise price n a Expected volatility n a Weighted average expected award life 1.5 years Expected dividend yield n a Risk free interest rate n a Details of relevant TBOP awards outstanding during the year are as follows: 2007 Number of awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year Granted during the year 711,839 Forfeited during the year Vested during the year Lapsed during the year Outstanding at the end of the year 711,839 The TBOP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.7 years.
126 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 All employee schemes Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme Grant details The Scheme operates in the UK, is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees.
Options may be granted at up to a 20% discount to the market price of the Companys shares immediately preceding the date of invitation.
The vesting period for the options is three, five or seven years.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: the Scheme operates in the UK within specific tax legislation and is therefore not subject to performance conditions other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in order to exercise their options.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use The use of the Scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis.
No options were granted under this Scheme during the years ended 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.
Details of relevant options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share exercise share exercise options price p options price p Outstanding at the beginning of the year 10,558 242.20 12,547 224.55 Granted during the year n a n a Forfeited during the year 2,295 387.03 n a Exercised during the year n a n a Lapsed during the year 2,295 387.03 1,989 130.77 Outstanding at the end of the year 5,968 130.77 10,558 242.20 Exercisable at the end of the year 1,989 130.77 2,295 387.03 The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.0 years 2006: 1.3 years and the exercise price is 130.77p.
Measurement of fair value The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of options granted.
An adjusted market value method of valuation, based on market value at grant date, adjusted for expected forfeitures and market-based performance conditions has been used to calculate the fair value of all other awards i. e. LTIP and RSP awards.
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous ten years and on the implied volatility of traded options of the Companys shares.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based payment expense The Company recognised total expenses of 3 million 2006: 3 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
