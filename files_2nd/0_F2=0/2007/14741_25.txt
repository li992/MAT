These assets are reported as current assets which represents a change in presentation from the accounts to 31 March 2006.
The impairment charge reflects the reduction in the fair value of granted carbon allowances following the date of grant.
The value of carbon emissions liabilities was reduced by an identical amount resulting in a nil impact on the Income Statement.
ii Development expenditure Development costs relate to the design, construction and testing of renewable generation devices which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits.
iii Brands Included within brands is the Atlantic brand, acquired on the acquisition of Atlantic Electric and Gas Limited in administrative receivership during the year ended 31 March 2005.
The Group have assessed the economic life of the Atlantic brand to be 10 years and the brand is being amortised over this period.
The charge is reported as part of operating costs.
iv Other intangible assets Included within other intangible assets are application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software packages.
These assets are amortised over 5 years.
The Company does not hold intangible assets.
Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2007 71 Impairment testing of goodwill: 2007 2006 Goodwill description Cash-generating unit m m Swalec Swalec i 187.0 187.0 Medway Generation ii 22.2 22.2 Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge Generation ii 17.7 17.7 Hornsea SSE Hornsea Limited iii 56.2 56.2 Neos Neos Networks Limited iv 7.8 7.8 Connect South West Contracting v 0.8 0.8 Eastern Contracting Contracting v 0.9 0.9 Harrison Smith Batley Contracting v 0.6 0.8 293.2 293.4 Impairment review on goodwill balances Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
The impairment test involves determining the cash generating unit to which the goodwill belongs and thereafter estimating the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or the value in use.
Value in use calculations have been used to determine the recoverable amounts for the cash generating units noted above.
These are based on five year projected cash flows extracted from the corporate business model which has been approved by the Executive and the Board.
Discount rates in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% on a pre-tax basis have been applied to those cash flows.
The Generation and Supply business segment, which is managed and accounted for as an integrated business unit, has been split into cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing only.
The key assumptions applied in determining the recoverable amounts for the cash generating units are as follows: i Swalec The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill relating to Swalec is based on an assessment of the recoverable amount of the Swalec business unit, which was acquired in 2001 and is an electricity and gas supply business serving, primarily, South Wales.
In projecting the gross margin for the business, factors such as market demand, market share and forward wholesale energy prices are considered.
Management believes that the assumed margins are reasonably achievable.
ii Generation The impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill relating to Medway and Fiddlers Ferry Ferrybridge is based on an assessment of the recoverable amount of the Groups combined Generation assets.
The projected cash flows of this cash generating unit have been assessed solely in order to comply with the requirements of IAS 36.
In projecting the gross margin for the combined Generation assets, factors such as market demand, market share and forward wholesale energy prices have been considered.
The specific goodwill balances relate to the following acquired businesses: a Medway, a gas-fired power station, which was acquired after the acquisition of the remaining 62.5% shareholding in the power station in November 2003, and b, the Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge coal-fired power stations, which were acquired in August 2004. iii SSE Hornsea Limited The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill associated with Hornsea has been carried out based on the recoverable amount of SSE Hornsea Limited.
This is based on projected cash flows which include management estimates of projected demand for gas storage, injection and withdrawal tariffs and wholesale gas prices.
iv Neos Networks Limited The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill associated with Neos has been carried out based on the recoverable amount of Neos Networks Limited.
This is based on projected cash flows which include management estimates of sales growth in the range of 10 20%.
v Contracting The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill related to the acquisitions of Eastern Contracting, Connect South West and Harrison Smith Batley were based on cash flow projections of the acquiring subsidiary entity, Southern Electric Contracting, which has successfully integrated these businesses into its operations.
Management believes that the assumed margins included in the projections are reasonably achievable.
It should be noted that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with Harrison Smith Batley has changed to 0.6m.
This is explained at note 14.
In all cases management conclude that the projected future cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of the recognised goodwill and the other cash generating unit assets.
Management believe that while cash flow projections are subject to inherent uncertainty, any reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions utilised in assessing recoverable amounts would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units identified.
Managements approach to assessing the value in use takes into account past experience and other relevant external information.
Scotia Gas Networks investment in gas distribution networks The Groups share of Scotia Gas Networks investment in the gas distribution networks includes an amount of acquired goodwill.
In testing for impairment, management believe that both the fair value less costs to sell of the business and the value in use of the cash generating unit support the carrying value of goodwill inherent in the Groups financial statements.
