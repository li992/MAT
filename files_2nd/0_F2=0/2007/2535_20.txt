Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Parent undertaking The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
These accounts present information about the Company as an individual undertaking, under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and not about its Group.

The Company is exempt from the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No.
Accounting policies Investments The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost less any provisions made for impairment.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are stated at proceeds received less any unamortised issue costs.
Issue costs of loans The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments is allocated to periods over the terms of the instrument using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All borrowing costs are recognised as finance costs in the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved and paid.
Taxation The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the year, after any adjustments in respect of prior years.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.

Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate uctuations classied as cash ow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and loss account.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing interest rate swaps designated as cash ow hedging instruments is as follows: For cash ow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the profit and loss account.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the profit and loss account or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the profit and loss account.

Loss of the company The Company made a loss of 11.6m in the year 2006: loss of 3.5m.
