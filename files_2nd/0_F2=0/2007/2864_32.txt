Deferred consideration which is expected to be paid has been accrued in respect of acquisitions made in the current year amounting to 7.8m.
The impact of this is to increase goodwill by the same amount.
As required by IAS 12 deferred taxation is calculated on intangible assets recognised as a result of an acquisition, the impact of this was to increase goodwill in 2007 by 4.3m and to create a deferred tax liability of the same amount.
As a result of the above, total goodwill of 105.8m was recognised in the year.
Other acquisitions in the year included Aspen Actuaries & Pension Consultants Limited now known as Capita Hartshead Actuaries & Pension Consultants Limited, Higham Dunnet Shaw Plc now known as Capita Hartshead Solutions Limited, Global Fund Administration Limited now known as Capita Financial Administrators Gibraltar Limited, M. V. R. A.
Limited, Eagle Management Services Limited and CPFR Solutions Limited.
The performance of these acquisitions post their inclusion in the Group cannot be ascertained as they have been fully integrated within existing offerings.
In January 2008 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Nieuwenhuis Services B. V for a consideration of 5.3m, with a further 2.7m payable over the next four years subject to the business achieving certain performance targets.
