Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 2 Segmental reporting At 31 December 2007 the Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main business segments: Processor Division PD, encompassing those resources that are centred around microprocessor cores, including specic functions such as graphics IP, fabric IP, embedded software and congurable digital signal processing IP.
Physical IP Division PIPD, concerned with the building blocks necessary for translation of a circuit design into actual silicon.
Systems Design Division SDD, focused on the tools and models used to create and debug software and system-on-chip SoC designs.
This is based upon the Groups internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in which the board of directors is provided with financial information.
Whilst revenues are reported into four main revenue streams namely licensing, royalties, development systems and services, the costs, operating results and balance sheets are only analysed into these three divisions.
In 2007, the Group early-adopted IFRS 8, Operating segments.
This supersedes IAS 14, Segmental reporting, under which segments were identied and reported on risk and return analysis.
Under IFRS 8, segments are reported based on internal reporting, bringing segment reporting in line with the requirements of US standard FAS 131.
For the Group, the impact of this is purely presentational as under IAS 14, the Groups business segments were still dened as PD, PIPD and SDD.
Acquisitions in 2006 were allocated to the divisions as follows: Falanx to PD and Soisic to PIPD.
Goodwill on each acquisition has also been allocated into these divisions.
The following analysis is of revenues: operating costs: investment income: interest payable: profit loss before tax, tax: profit loss after tax: depreciation: amortisation of other intangible assets: share-based payment costs: capital expenditure: total assets and liabilities: net assets and goodwill for each segment and the Group in total.
Unallocated operating costs are foreign exchange revaluation on monetary items, including cash and cash equivalents.
Unallocated assets and liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents: short-term investments and marketable securities: some deferred tax balances: current tax and VAT.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, including additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.
The results of each segment have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with those of the Group as a whole.
