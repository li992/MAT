Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice 'Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies' issued in 2003 and revised in December 2005.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements and the net asset value per share figures have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
b Revenue, expenses and interest payable Income from equity investments other than special dividends, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Special dividends are credited to revenue or capital according to the circumstances.
Foreign income is converted at the exchange rate applicable at the time of receipt.
Interest receivable on AAA rated money market funds and short term deposits and expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Income from underwriting commission is recognised as earned.
Interest payable is calculated on an effective yield basis.
Expenses are charged to capital when they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments.
In this respect, the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Board's expectation of returns from the Companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively see note 3. c Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fiderecognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
SETS is the London Stock Exchange electronic trading service covering most of the market including all FTSE 100 constituents and most liquid FTSE 250 constituents along with some other securities.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
d Dividends payable Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
e Realised capital reserve Realised gains and losses on realisation of investments held at fair value are recognised in the Income Statement and are ultimately transferred to the realised capital reserve.
In addition, any prior unrealised gains or losses on such investments are transferred from the unrealised capital reserve to the realised capital reserve on disposal of the investment.
The capital element of the management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is also credited to this reserve.
f Unrealised capital reserve Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at fair value are recognised in the Income Statement and are then transferred to the unrealised capital reserve.
Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC 37 Notes to the Financial Statements continued g Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Temporary differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Owing to the Company's status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
h Foreign currency The Company receives a small proportion of its investment income in foreign currency.
These amounts are translated at the rate ruling on the date of receipt.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the Balance Sheet date.

At the year end, the Company had accumulated surplus management expenses and loan relationship losses of 93,933,000 2006 88,712,000 restated.
These have been generated because such a large part of the Company's income is derived from dividends from UK companies.
The Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.
These losses are not recognised as a deferred tax asset because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that future period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.

Net asset value per share Equity Shareholders' funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 'Capital Instruments'.
The analysis of equity Shareholders' funds on the face of the Balance Sheet does not reflect the rights under the Articles of Association of the Ordinary Shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the net asset value per share attributable to Ordinary Shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the Debenture Stock at par.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures is as follows: Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC 43 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2007 2006 Equity Shareholders' funds 456,067,000 398,267,000 Adjusted net assets 455,908,000 398,095,000 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 153,969,634 157,200,735 Equity Shareholders' funds per share 296.20p 253.35p Less: Unamortised Debenture Stock premium and issue expenses 0.10p 0.11p Adjusted net asset value per share 296.10p 253.24p The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the Ordinary shares were as follows: 2007 2006 '000 '000 Opening adjusted net assets 398,095 368,649 Capital return for the year 63,651 52,175 Revenue on ordinary activities after taxation 15,701 14,520 Dividends appropriated in the year 13,330 12,397 Movement in unamortised Debenture Stock premium and issue expenses 13 19 Premium paid on Debenture Stock repurchased 23,080 Purchase of own shares 8,222 1,791 Closing adjusted net assets 455,908 398,095 The net asset value per share at 31 January 2007, adjusted to include the Debenture Stock at market value rather than at par is 292.33p 2006 247.93p.
Risk management, financial assets and liabilities Risk management The major risks associated with the Company are market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movements, gearing risk, and to a lesser extent liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Company has established a framework for managing these risks which is evolving continually as the Company's investment activities change in response to market developments.
The Board has provided the Manager with guidelines and limits for the management of market risk, gearing, and financial assets and liabilities.
Market risk Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, valuations accorded to equities, movements in prices and the liquidity of financial instruments.
Market price risk is managed through investment guidelines agreed by the Board with the Manager and is discussed at each Board meeting.
Gearing It is the Company's policy to increase its exposure to equity market price risk through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowed funds are invested in equities, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders' funds of changes both positive and negative in the value of the portfolio.
44 Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC During the year ended 31 January 2007, the Company's borrowings consisted of a long term Debenture and a short term loan, details of which can be found in notes 11 and 12.
The Debenture Stock provides secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through the borrowing facility.
The Debenture Stock is valued at amortised cost in the financial statements but the Board also monitors its market value.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances and is also able, if the circumstances warrant, to use derivatives or to purchase fixed interest securities in order to offset the effect of gearing.
It is the Board's policy to maintain a gearing level, measured on the most stringent basis of calculation after netting off cash equivalents, of less than 30% at all times.
Financial assets and liabilities The Company's financial instruments comprise equity investments, cash balances, AAA money market funds, Debenture Stock and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement.
Investments see note 9 are designated as fair value through profit or loss and are valued at closing market prices which equate to their fair values.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities other than the Debenture Stock, as detailed in note 12, are represented by their carrying values in the Balance Sheet.
The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
Post Balance Sheet Event The management fee, with effect from 1 February 2007, is calculated at 0.45% on the first 225 million, 0.35% on the next 200 million and 0.25% over 425 million per annum of the net assets of the Company, with debt at par and excluding commonly managed funds.
