Prior to this date the Group was owned by Anglo American plc.
Presentation of this ownership interest can be found in note 26.
2 Mondi plc also issued 50,000 5% cumulative 1 preference shares.
The Group classifies these preference shares as a liability, and not as equity instruments, since they contractually obligate the Group to make cumulative dividend payments to the holders.
The dividend payments are treated as a finance cost rather than distributions.
3 The special converting shares are held on trust and do not carry dividend rights.
The special converting shares provide a mechanism for equality of treatment on termination for both Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary equity holders.
  The Group participated in the share-based payment arrangements of Anglo American plc during 2006 and up to the date of demerger during 2007.
All of the schemes are equity-settled, either by award of options to acquire ordinary shares, under the Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS, or award of ordinary shares, under the Bonus Share Plan BSP, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The total share-based payment charge for the respective periods is made up as follows: 1 million 2007 2006 ESOS 1 3 BSP 5 2 LTIP 4 1 Total share-based payment expense 10 6 Note: 1 Included within the charge for 2007 is an amount of 8 million representing the accelerated charge on legacy Anglo American plc schemes, which were deemed to have fully vested on demerger.
The accelerated charge has been classified as an operating special item see note 5.
Disclosure of the assumptions used to fair value the awards made under these schemes is contained within the Prospectus dated 1 June 2007.
On demerger from Anglo American plc, the Group has cash-settled its obligations in respect of share awards made under these schemes, with the minor exception of outstanding 2004 ESOS awards in South Africa, which will be cash-settled as options are exercised by recipients over a period of two years from the demerger date.
The share-based payments reserve has been adjusted to remove the balance attributable to these schemes, thereby reflecting the elimination of Anglo American plcs equity interest in the Group see note 26 for further information on the Groups demerger accounting.
