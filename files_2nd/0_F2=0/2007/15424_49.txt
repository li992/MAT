21 Provisions continued Deferred consideration represents managements best estimate of amounts that the group is contractually bound to pay in the future for acquisitions, where such estimates can be made reliably.
The amounts payable are based on the future performance of the acquired businesses, and the provisions recognised are determined with reference to the latest forecasts available.
The deferred consideration is expected to be paid within one to three years of the balance sheet date, and provisions are discounted where the effect is material using discount rates comparable with bank lending rates available to the group.
Onerous lease provisions represent the net rental cost to the group of empty leasehold properties and the net rent in excess of market rents for properties acquired with acquisitions to the end of the relevant lease periods.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2013.
Panel incentives represent best estimates of rewards payable in the future to panellists for their participation in panels research.
Amounts are estimated based on the value of incentives earned and are expected to be satisfied within one to two years.
Other provisions consist of liabilities arising as a result of ongoing litigation or claims, restructuring provisions excluding property of 2.9m 2006 6.8m and other amounts that are not individually material to the group.
The amounts are expected to be paid within one to five years.
No provisions were held by the company as at 31 December 2007 2006 nil.
22 Financial risk management and financial instruments The groups international operations and significant debt financing expose it to a range of financial risks that include changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and bank solvency credit ratings.
The group has a risk management policy to manage these financial risks over the short and medium term, to reduce volatility to earnings and shareholders funds and to aid future planning, by seeking to limit the impact of adverse movements in these variables.
The group holds foreign currency debt and uses interest rate and currency exchange rate financial instruments as part of this policy.
The board has delegated to a Financing Committee, chaired by the Finance Director, the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the groups financial risk management policy and on a semi-annual basis formally reviews this policy and its performance in delivering the boards objectives.
The group has a centralised treasury and financial risk function, which implements the risk management policy and it formally reports, on a monthly basis, the results of its activities and its compliance with the policy to the Financing Committee.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed.
Interest rate risk On 31 December 2007, the group had liquid resources of 90.2m 2006 61.8m held at floating rates and borrowings of 316.6m 2006 340.2m at floating rates.
It is therefore exposed to variations in primarily UK, US and Eurozone interest rates on these financial assets and liabilities.
The group has a policy of using financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements, to ensure that the level of effective fixed rate debt after the effect of these instruments is between 55% and 75% of total net debt.
At the year end 68.6% 2006 68.0% of net debt was at effective fixed rates.
Based on debt, interest rates and hedge levels existing at 31 December 2007, a 1% rise in interest rates before the effect of the interest rate hedge would increase the annual interest charge as follows: on USD loans 0.7m 2006 1.6m, EUR 1.4m 2006 1.5m and GBP 0.7m 2006 0.1m.
A 1% rise in interest rates on a hedged basis would increase the annual interest charge as follows: USD 0.7m 2006 0.6m, EUR 0.1m 2006 0.5m and GBP 0.8m 2006 0.1m.
A 1% decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect in each case.
Had interest rates been 1% higher or lower at 31 December 2007, the fair value of interest rate hedge instruments held in equity at that date would not have been significantly different.
Currency risk The groups principal exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas earnings and net assets into sterling for accounting purposes and the sterling value of dividends paid up to the group.
The material foreign currencies in terms of earnings and net assets are the US dollar and Euro.
The group has a policy of holding a substantial amount of its bank debt in these currencies, to provide a natural hedge for currency earnings by currency interest payments and for currency net assets by the currency loan principal.
The policy ensures that the level of currency hedge debt and currency forwards where used should be greater than 75% and less than 100% of net assets for all currencies where net assets are greater than 10.0m.
The group uses forward currency contracts for hedging future certain and material dividend flows to the group.
TNS Annual Report and Accounts 2007 79 Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Governance Statements Information Notes to the financial statements 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Had the US dollar been 10% weaker against sterling throughout the year with all other variables held constant, the groups post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.4m lower 2006 0.3m higher.
Had the US dollar been 10% stronger against sterling at 31 December 2007, the retranslation of gross US dollar financial liabilities at that date would have resulted in a reduction in the groups equity of 31.1m 2006 28.5m.
Had the Euro been 10% weaker against sterling throughout the year with all other variables held constant, the groups post-tax profit for the year would have been 4.4m 2006 1.9m lower.
Had the Euro been 10% stronger against sterling at 31 December 2007, the retranslation of gross Euro financial liabilities at that date would have resulted in a reduction in the groups equity of 45.2m 2006 44.1m.
In each case, an opposite movement in exchange rates would have given rise to an opposite effect on post-tax profit and equity.
As required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure, this analysis excludes the mitigating effects of the natural hedges discussed above and of hedge instruments actually in place throughout the year and as at 31 December 2007.
The group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risk from sales and purchases of services between members of the group.
This is hedged initially by matching cash flows through a netting process, and finally by using forward currency contracts where material.
The level of net transactional exposure is currently not considered material.
Currency and interest rate exposures of financial liabilities The interest rate and currency exposures of the groups financial liabilities at 31 December, after taking account of interest and currency swaps, were: Not interest Average years to maturity bearing Floating rate Fixed rate Total 2007 m m m m Floating rate Fixed rate Sterling 47.9 117.9 13.7 179.5 3.3 2.1 Euro 118.4 21.3 122.0 261.7 3.4 2.1 US dollar 27.7 70.5 105.8 204.0 7.4 4.7 Other 57.7 1.3 59.0 1.7 251.7 211.0 241.5 704.2 4.7 3.2 Not interest Average years to maturity bearing Floating rate Fixed rate Total 2006 m m m m Floating rate Fixed rate Sterling 38.4 31.4 7.6 77.4 0.8 2.5 Euro 73.6 55.9 95.8 225.3 1.4 3.0 US dollar 46.3 62.8 99.6 208.7 1.9 3.2 Other 14.5 0.6 0.6 15.7 0.3 2.0 172.8 150.7 203.6 527.1 1.4 3.1 Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on LIBOR or EURIBOR.
Fixed rate financial liabilities relate to the hedged proportion of borrowings and deferred consideration.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate financial liabilities is sterling 6.7% 2006 5.8%, US dollar 5.9% 2006 5.1% and Euro 4.2% 2006 4.1%.
Currency and interest rate exposures of financial assets The currency and interest rate exposures of financial assets at 31 December were: Not interest Not interest bearing Floating rate 2007 bearing Floating rate 2006 m m m m m m Sterling 44.5 35.3 79.8 40.6 19.2 59.8 Euro 117.8 25.2 143.0 84.2 16.8 101.0 US dollar 36.7 1.2 37.9 90.5 1.9 92.4 Other 70.0 28.5 98.5 14.4 23.9 38.3 269.0 90.2 359.2 229.7 61.8 291.5 Financial assets represents cash which attracts interest at floating rates and trade and other receivables that are not interest bearing.

com 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Hedge accounting and hedging gains and losses Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement, except where the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment for derivatives classified as hedges depends on their designation.
The group designates derivatives either as a hedge of the income or cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or commitment cash flow hedge, as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end, to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Unrealised gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Gains or losses on fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement as they arise, together with any changes in fair value of the hedged item.
Where foreign currency debt is used to hedge long-term currency net investments, gains and losses on any residual net investment are taken directly to reserves using hedge accounting.
If the group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument for net investments, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments used for hedging Excluding currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges disclosed below and interest rate fair value hedges disclosed within net debt in note 29, the following gains and losses were accounted for using hedge accounting.
Interest rate cash Foreign currency fair flow hedge instruments value hedge instruments 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Unrealised gains at 1 January 0.2 0.5 0.2 Interest rate hedge losses gains arising in the year 0.8 0.3 Interest rate hedge losses gains recognised in finance costs 0.4 0.6 Currency hedge losses gains recognised in administrative expenses 0.2 0.4 Currency hedge gains losses realised on settlement during the year 0.3 0.6 Unrealised losses gains at 31 December 0.2 0.2 0.1 Gains of 0.1m 2006 losses of 0.8m arose in the year on the foreign currency assets and liabilities subject to the above fair value hedges.
Of the 0.2m of unrecognised losses 2006 0.2m gains on interest rate cash flow hedges at the end of the year, a 0.1m gain 2006 0.5m loss is expected to be recognised in the 2008 income statement and a 0.2m loss 2006 0.7m gain is expected to be recognised in 2009.
Book and fair values of financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments are not materially different from their book values unless otherwise disclosed in the relevant balance sheet notes.
Excluding currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges disclosed below and interest rate fair value hedges disclosed within net debt in note 29, derivative instruments open at the balance sheet date are carried at the following fair values: Assets Liabilities 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Instruments held to manage interest rate exposure cash flow hedges 1.2 0.7 1.4 0.5 Instruments held to manage currency exposure fair value hedges 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.1 Currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges The group had both US dollar and Euro denominated borrowings at the balance sheet date, which it has designated as a hedge for the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US and the Eurozone.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 31 December 2007 was 176.3m 2006 157.2m and the Euro borrowings 136.7m 2006 149.0m.
In 2007, gains and losses taken to reserves on net currency investments totalled a gain of 11.4m 2006 10.6m loss, including net losses on foreign currency debt of 9.4m 2006 26.0m gains.
Embedded derivatives Management has a policy of not entering into contracts that involve embedded derivatives.
The group has performed a review of contracts and has concluded that no embedded derivatives exist.
TNS Annual Report and Accounts 2007 81 Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Governance Statements Information Notes to the financial statements 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Credit and counterparty risk The group has liquid resources deposited and financial instruments with a range of financial institutions and is therefore exposed to credit solvency risk from these institutions.
The group has a policy that defines at which institutions funds can be placed and instruments dealt, and defines credit limits based on those institutions credit ratings.
The Financing Committee is responsible for approving new counterparties on a global basis and defining these limits.
Financial institutions with which the group has placed deposits and holds financial instruments have credit ratings of between AA and A.
The group is also exposed to credit risk from its trade counterparties.
Details of the credit risk associated with the groups financial assets are set out below.
Financial assets that are either past due or impaired Maximum Past due by Between 1 Past due by credit risk less than 1 and 3 more than 3 Impaired book value month months months assets 2007 m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 90.2 Trade receivables 243.7 30.6 19.3 7.0 5.0 Amounts owed by related parties 2.6 Other receivables 27.7 364.2 30.6 19.3 7.0 5.0 2006 m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 61.8 Trade receivables 218.4 36.5 23.5 10.2 5.6 Amounts owed by related parties 2.7 Other receivables 14.9 297.8 36.5 23.5 10.2 5.6 No collateral is held by the group as security over these financial assets, but the group considers all that are not impaired to be of good quality and fully recoverable.
No credit terms have been renegotiated in the period.
Impaired assets are past due by more than three months.
The remaining trade receivables that are past due are not considered to be impaired based on prior cash collection experience.
Liquidity risk The group maintains sufficient facilities, both committed and uncommitted, to finance projected working capital and general corporate needs over the medium term.
The policy ensures that total drawings from all facilities is at all times less than 80% of total committed facilities and that the average maturity profile of committed facilities is greater than 18 months at any time.
At 31 December 2007, the average maturity profile of committed facilities was 4.0 years 2006 2.6 years, and 122.6m 2006 183.8m of these facilities and 35.0m 2006 41.2m of uncommitted facilities were undrawn and available to the group.
