Details of each of the employee share plans in place are given below and where applicable in the remuneration report.
As described in note 27, the Group issued ordinary share capital by way of a rights issue at a discount to the market.
Consequently a bonus element was applied to the number of share options outstanding as at the date of the rights issue and the exercise price of those options were reduced so that the fair value of the grant to the option holder was not affected.
Below is a summary of the schemes in place during the year: a Executive share option scheme The Group operates an executive share option scheme under which awards of share options are made to selected individuals directors and senior managers based on the achievement of an EPS growth target established at the date of grant.
The EPS growth is calculated for a continuous three year period during the normal exercise period.
When the EPS growth is met the options vest and can be exercised within ten years of the grant date.
b Performance share plan Under the 2003 and 2004 awards, selected individuals directors and senior managers receive an award of shares based on the growth in the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the Group over a three year performance period when compared to growth in TSR of FTSE mid 250 companies, provided that the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group has improved on a sustainable basis over the period.
To the extent that any options vest, they will ordinarily remain exercisable up to three years and three months from the date of grant and are settled in equity once exercised.
Under the 2005 and 2006 awards, which were restricted to executive directors, an award may be made, provided a non-market-based performance condition of specified EPS growth is achieved over a three year performance period.
c Sharesave scheme Under the schemes, which are open to all employees of eligible Group companies, employees are granted share options at a discount to the open market value at the date of grant.
The employees enter into a savings plan for a three year period after which they have a choice of exercising their option or withdrawing saved funds.
No conditions other than continued employment are attached to the grant.
Share-based payments continued d Share matching plan Under the scheme, selected individuals directors and senior managers may invest a portion of their annual cash bonus in the companys shares at open market price.
Based on the amount invested, the Group will award free matching shares after a three year vesting period equivalent to the amount invested at the grant date share price, grossed up for tax.
e Senior manager share plan Under the 2007 award, an award may be made to senior management, provided a non-market-based condition of specified EPS growth is achieved over a three year performance period.

For each new grant, the historical volatility is considered for a period in line with the expected life of the options granted.
The expected life used in the calculations has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
