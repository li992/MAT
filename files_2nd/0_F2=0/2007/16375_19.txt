The following items are disclosed on the face of the income statement as separate disclosure provides additional information to users to help them better understand underlying business performance.
million million million 2007 2006 2005 Restructuring 875 704 328 Business disposals, impairments and other: Gain loss on disposals of group companies 297 179 132 Impairments 14 397 Provision for release of Brazilian sales tax 9 31 16 Gains on US healthcare and UK pensions 266 Restructuring costs are incurred as Unilever continues to simplify the organisation, reorganise operations and support functions and redevelop the portfolio.
They primarily relate to redundancy and retirement costs.
The significant costs incurred in 2007 are in respect of new multi-country organisations announced and several factory closures.
Business disposals generate both costs and revenues which are not reective of underlying performance.
Impairment charges are primarily recognised for goodwill other than where included in restructuring or as part of business disposals.
In 2005 an impairment charge of 363 million was recognised in respect of Slim Fast.
The gains on US healthcare arose from the introduction of an annual cap on the benets which each participant can claim.
The gain in the UK resulted from reducing deferred pensions where they are taken early.

Earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the revised nominal share values which have been applied since 22 May 2006 and which resulted in a one-to-one equivalence of ordinary shares of NV and PLC as regards their economic interest in the Group.
For further information please refer to note 22 on page 109.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on: i conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038, as described in Corporate governance on page 42: ii conversion of the 0.05 NV preference shares, details of which are set out below and in note 16 on page 94: iii the effect of share-based compensation plans, details of which are set out in note 29 on pages 117 to 119: and iv the forward equity contract described in note 29 on page 119.
On 15 February 2005, Unilever converted its 0.05 NV preference shares into ordinary 0.51 NV shares.
The conversion was made using shares already held by Unilever for the purposes of satisfying the Groups share-based compensation plans.
Unilever bought further ordinary shares in the market during 2005 to the extent required to restore the hedging position.
Until the date of conversion, the 0.05 preference shares were potentially dilutive for the purposes of the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share, as shown below.
At midnight on 13 July 2005 the 0.05 NV preference shares were cancelled.

9 Goodwill and intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
Brands that are classied as indefinite have been in the market for many years, and the nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years.
The level of amortisation for nitelived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next five years.

Impairments charges in the year There were no impairments in 2007.
The impairments charged in 2006 principally related to business disposals that were completed during 2007.
In 2006, Slim Fast was fully integrated into The Americas business as part of the North American beverage operations.
As a result of the integration, Slim Fast is no longer evaluated on a stand-alone basis but as part of the North American beverage CGU.
The 2007 and 2006 impairment reviews on this basis did not result in any impairments 2005: 363 million.
significant CGUs The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets predominantly Knorr and Hellmanns held in the global savoury and dressings CGU, comprising 11.1 billion 2006: 11.6 billion and 3.2 billion 2006: 3.4 billion respectively, are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at 31 December 2007.
No other CGUs are considered significant in this respect.
During 2007, we conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets.
Value in use of the global savoury and dressings CGU has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash ows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% was used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow projections for the savoury and dressings CGU: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 4%, adjusted for market fade, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple: average near-term nominal growth for the major product groups within the CGU of 4%: and average operating margins for the major product groups within the CGU ranging from 15% to 18%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
We believe that the assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the savoury and dressings CGU are consistent with past performance.
The projections covered a period of ten years as we believe this to be a suitable timescale over which to review and consider annual performance before applying a xed terminal value multiple to the final year cash ows of the detailed projection.
Stopping the detailed projections after five years and applying a terminal value multiple thereafter would not result in a value in use that would cause impairment.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average rates of growth for similar products.
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions and have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the global savoury and dressings CGU to be less than the carrying amount.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1 471 million and tax credits amounting to 503 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1 146 million and tax credits of 503 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 456 million of state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2027.
Other deductible temporary differences of 123 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1 059 million 2006: 755 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same scal authority.

The 4% preference capital of NV is redeemable at par at the companys option either wholly or in part.
The other classes of preferential share capital of NV are not unilaterally redeemable by the company.
At the Annual General Meeting of NV held on 8 May 2006 it was agreed to convert the nominal value of all classes of shares from guilders into euros.
The 7% and 6% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.
1 000 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of 428.57 each, and the 4% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.
100 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of 42.86 each.
The effect of this was to adjust their reported value, with the difference being held as a statutory reserve.
In order to maintain the same economic rights for the preference shares as before the euro conversion, it was decided that their entitlement to dividend and liquidation proceeds remains linked, using the ofcial euro conversion rate, to the amount in Dutch guilders originally paid up on these shares.
The euro conversion did not alter the dividend entitlements of the cumulative preference shares.

96 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management Treasury Risk Management Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and counterparty risks.
Currency risks Because of Unilevers broad operational reach, it is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values that could affect earnings.
As a practical matter, it is not feasible to fully hedge these uctuations.
Additionally, Unilever believes that most currencies of major countries in which it operates will equalise against the euro over time.
Unilever does have a foreign exchange policy that requires operating companies to manage trading and financial foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits.
This is achieved primarily through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
On a case by case basis, depending on potential income statement volatility that can be caused by the fair value movement of the derivative, companies decide whether or not to apply cash ow hedge accounting.
Regional groups monitor compliance with this foreign exchange policy.
At the end of 2007, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign currencies but publishes its financial statements and measures its performance in euros, it is subject to exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
Unilever aims to minimise its foreign exchange exposure in operating companies by borrowing in the local currency, except where inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local market conditions.
For those countries that in the view of management have a substantial retranslation risk, Unilever may decide on a case by case basis, taking into account amongst others the impact on the income statement, to hedge such net investment.
This is achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts on which hedge accounting is applied.
Nevertheless, from time to time, currency revaluations on unhedged investments will trigger exchange translation movements in the balance sheet.
Interest rate risks Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at achieving an optimal balance between xed and oating rate interest rate exposures on expected net debt gross borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents levels for the next five calendar years.
The objective of the policy is to minimise annual interest costs and to reduce volatility.
This is achieved by issuing xed rate long-term debt and by modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps.
The xing levels per calendar year are determined by xing bands, with minimum and maximum xing level percentages, decreasing by 10 percentage points per calendar year.
The minimum level in the first year amounts to 50% and the maximum level amounts to 90%.
The minimum level is set to avoid unacceptable interest cost volatility and the maximum level is set to prevent over-xing, recognising that future debt levels can be volatile.
At the end of 2007, interest rates were xed on approximately 68% of the projected net of cash and financial liability positions for 2008 and 53% for 2009 compared with 48% for 2007 and 52% for 2008 at the end of 2006.
Liquidity risk A material and sustained shortfall in our cash ow could undermine our credit rating and overall investor confidence and could restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
Operational cash ow provides the funds to service the nancing of financial liabilities and enhance shareholder return.
Unilever manages the liquidity requirements by the use of short-term and long-term cash ow forecasts.
Unilever maintains access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support its commercial paper programmes and for general corporate purposes.
Unilever had the following undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2007: revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $3 630 million 2006: US $3 930 million with a 364-day term out: revolving 364-day notes commitments of US $200 million 2006: US $200 million with the ability to issue notes with a maturity up to 364 days: and 364-day bilateral money market commitments of in aggregate US $1 720 million 2006: US $1 420 million, under which the underwriting banks agree, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for notes with maturities of up to three years.
These facilities have been renewed until November 2008.
The revolving five-year bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $334 million and a revolving 364-day bilateral credit facility of in aggregate US $333 million matured in November 2007 and were not renewed.
The financial market turbulence and associated illiquidity in credit markets during the second half of 2007 did not impact Unilevers ability to meet its nancing requirements.

Credit risk on banks and received collateral Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with banks like cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
To reduce the credit risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited group of banks that have secure credit ratings.
Per bank, individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
To reduce the credit exposures, netting agreements are in place with Unilevers principal banks that allow Unilever, in case of a default, to net assets and liabilities across transactions.
To further reduce Unilevers credit exposures, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal banks based on which they need to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2007 the collateral received by Unilever amounts to nil 2006: 2 million.
At 31 December 2007 there was no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty.
98 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Derivative financial instruments The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Boards, covering the use of derivative financial instruments.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes.
The Group has an established system of control in place covering all financial instruments: including policies, guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting, that is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
Hedge accounting principles are described in note 1 on page 74.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk element on the underlying hedged item has been excluded.
The Group uses the following types of hedges: cash ow hedges used to hedge the risk on future foreign currency cash ows, oating interest rate cash ows, and the price risk on future purchases of raw materials: fair value hedges used to convert the xed interest rate on financial liabilities into a oating interest rate: net investment hedges used to hedge the investment value of our foreign subsidiaries: and natural hedges used to hedge the risk on exposures that are on the balance sheet.
No hedge accounting is applied.
Details of the various types of hedges are given below.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts at the year-end forward exchange rates.
The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows.
Cash ow hedges The fair values of derivatives hedging the risk on future foreign currency cash ows, oating interest rate cash ows and the price risk on future purchases of raw materials amount to 85 million 2006: 9 million of which 88 million relates to commodity contracts 2006: 5 million, 10 million to foreign exchange contracts 2006: 2 million and 7million to interest rate derivatives 2006: 2 million.
Of the total fair value of 85 million, 82 million is due within one year 2006: 7 million.

The impact of exchange rate movements on the fair value of forward exchange contracts used to hedge net investments is recognised in reserves.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2007 99 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Natural hedges A natural hedge sometimes known as an economic hedge is where exposure to a risk is offset, or partly offset, by an opposite exposure to that same risk.
Hedge accounting is not applied to these relationships.
The following table shows the fair value of derivatives outstanding at year end that are natural hedges.

The remaining balances are shown under trade and other receivables and other liabilities.
Sensitivity to not applying hedge accounting Derivatives have to be reported at fair value.
Those derivatives used for cash ow hedging and net investment hedging for which we do not apply hedge accounting will cause volatility in the income statement.
Such derivatives did not have a material impact on the 2007 income statement.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement', Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet specic requirements set out in the standard: no material embedded derivatives have been identied.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.
All trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency proles in note 15 on page 93 and note 16 on page 96, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value, because of their short-term nature.

Cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value: non-listed bonds and other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
Commodity contracts The Group uses commodity forward contracts and futures to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity forward contracts and futures hedge future purchases of raw material.
Settlement of these contracts will be in cash or by physical delivery.
Those contracts that will be settled in cash are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and, to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under IAS 39, fair value movements are recognised in the cash ow reserve.
Capital management The Groups financial strategy supports Unilevers aim to be in the top third of a reference group including 20 other international consumer goods companies for Total Shareholder Return, as explained on page 32.
The key elements of the financial strategy are: appropriate access to equity and debt markets: sufficient exibility for acquisitions that we fund out of current cash ows: A1 P1 short-term credit rating: sufficient resilience against economic turmoil: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints above.
For the A1 P1 sort-term credit rating the company monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
The capital structure of the company is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the companys strategic and day-to-day needs.
Annually the overall funding plan is presented to the Board for approval.
Return on Invested Capital is one of Unilever's key performance measures.
Within this denition we dened the components of our Invested Capital.
See page 31 for the details of this denition and the calculation of Unilever's Return on Invested Capital.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates The values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities holding them, are subject to exchange rate movements.
The translation risk on the foreign exchange debtors and creditors is excluded from this sensitivity analysis as the risk is considered to be immaterial because positions will remain within prescribed limits see currency risks on page 97.
The remaining foreign exchange positions at 31 December 2007 mainly relate to unhedged US $ loans total amount at 31 December 2007 US $37 million.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a 7 million movement in the income statement 2006: 16 million.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in interest rate Interest rate risks are presented by way of sensitivity analysis.
As described on page 97, Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility in the income statement.
As part of this policy, part of the funds debt have xed interest rates and are no longer exposed to changes in the oating rates.
The remaining oating part of our funds debt see interest rate prole tables on pages 93 for the assets and 96 for the liabilities is exposed to changes in the oating interest rates.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the income statement to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in oating interest rates on a full-year basis.
Sensitivity to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in oating rates as at 31 December million million 2007 2006 Funds 25 24 Debt 55 59 Net investment hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in foreign exchange rates To reduce the retranslation risk of Unilever's investments in foreign subsidiaries, Unilever uses net investment hedges.
The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements and changes in these fair values are recognised directly in equity and will offset the retranslation impact of the related subsidiary.
At 31 December 2007 the nominal value of these net investment hedges amounts to 7.5 billion 2006: 7.6 billion mainly consisting of US$ contracts.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a fair value movement of 750 million 2006: 760 million.
This movement would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the book equity of the foreign subsidiary.
Cash ow hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates Unilever uses on a limited scale both interest rate and forex cash ow hedges.
The fair values of these instruments are subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Because of the limited use of these instruments and the amount of Unilever's equity, possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates will not lead to fair value movements that will have a material impact on Unilever's equity.

Legal provisions are comprised of many claims, of which none is individually material.
The provision for disputed indirect taxes is comprised of a number of small disputed items.
The largest elements of the provision relate to disputes with the Brazilian authorities.
Because of the nature of the disputes, the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, and any associated cash outows, is uncertain.
The majority of the disputed items attract an interest charge.
For further information please refer to page 11.
No individual item within the other provisions balance is significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved over the next five years.
102 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 20 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Exposure to risks Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 17 253 million and 18 342 million respectively are held on the Groups balance sheet as at 31 December 2007.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates, ination and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in these schemes, and could prompt the need for the Group to make additional pension contributions, or to reduce pension contributions, in the future.
The key assumptions used to value our pension liabilities are set out below and on page 104.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The pension funds also have a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds, hedge funds and cash.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplied externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models currently for equities and hedge funds.
The aim is to provide a high quality, well diversied risk-controlled vehicle.
Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans which cover approximately 95% of total pension liabilities and plans providing other post-employment benets and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point 1% point increase decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 3 3 Effect on total benefit obligation 29 26 The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
Mortality assumptions for the most important countries are based on the following post-retirement mortality tables: i United Kingdom: PNMA 00 and PNFA 00 with medium cohort adjustment subject to a minimum annual improvement of 1% and scaling factors of 110% for current male pensioners, 125% for current female pensioners and 105% for future male and female pensioners: ii the Netherlands: GBMV 20002005 with age set back of four years for males and two years for females: iii United States: RP2000 with a projection period of 1015 years: and iv Germany: Heubeck 1998 Periodentafel with a scaling factor of 85%.
These tables translate into the following years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65: United United Kingdom Netherlands States Germany Males 21 20 19 18 Females 23 22 22 21 With regard to future improvements in life expectancy, in the UK for example, males and females currently aged 45 are assumed to have a life expectancy of 24 years and 26 years respectively on retirement at age 65.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.

The constituents of the Principal plans and Other plans were reviewed in both 2006 and 2007, such that some Other plans were moved into Principal plans in 2006 and a smaller number of plans were moved out of Principal plans into Other plans in 2007.
During 2007, a contractual trust arrangement was established in Germany to partially fund previously unfunded pension liabilities.
The initial funding was 300 million whilst the value of the previously unfunded liabilities at 1 January 2007 was approximately 850 million.
As a consequence of this funding, the liabilities have been transferred from unfunded to funded in the table above.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 32 million 0.2% of total plan assets and 32 million 0.2% of total plan assets at 31 December 2007 and 2006 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 69 million and 75 million at 31 December 2007 and 2006 respectively.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benets Trust amounting to 162 million 2006: 181 million to fund pension and similar obligations in the US see also note 11 on page 90.

During 2006 a number of initiatives were taken to reduce the cost of post employment healthcare benets, principally in the United States, through changes to the design of the plans.
As a consequence, a reduction in liability of 146 million was recognised in the income statement for 2006.
Cash ow Group cash ow in respect of pensions and similar post employment benets comprises company contributions paid to funded plans and benets paid by the company in respect of unfunded plans.
In 2007, the benets paid in respect of unfunded plans amounted to 280 million 2006: 333 million: 2005: 328 million.
Company contributions to funded dened benefit plans are subject to periodic review, taking account of local legislation.
In 2007, contributions to funded dened benefit plans including funding of previously unfunded benets amounted to 878 million 2006: 758 million: 2005: 508 million.
Contributions to dened contribution plans including 401k plans amounted to 52 million 2006: 61 million: 2005: 63 million.
In 2007, a 50 million refund of assets was received out of recognised surplus from Finland 2005: 15 million from unrecognised surplus.
Total contributions by the Group to funded plans, net of refunds, are currently expected to be about 235 million in 2008 2007 Actual: 878 million.
In addition, we may make further contributions in 2008 to fund currently unfunded obligations.
benefit payments by the Group in respect of unfunded plans are currently expected to be about 243 million in 2008 2007 Actual: 280 million.

b As part of the review of Unilever's corporate structure, and in the light of the constitutional and operational arrangements which enable Unilever N. V. and Unilever PLC to operate as nearly as practicable as a single company, the Directors have been authorised to take any action necessary or desirable in order to ensure that the ratio of the dividend generating capacity of PLC to that of NV does not differ substantially from the ratio of the dividend entitlement of ordinary shareholders in PLC to that of ordinary shareholders in NV.
During 2007, Unilevers shareholding in Unilever Jernimo Martins in Portugal was transferred from NV to PLC for no consideration.
In addition, a part of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US was sold by NV to PLC and the fair value economic swap in South Africa led to further adjustments between NV and PLC.
In 2006, shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia and Turkey, as well as a part of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US, were transferred from NV to PLC for no consideration.
In addition, part of a dividend which would otherwise be due from a Unilever US intermediate company to a company within the NV part of the Group was instead paid to a company within the PLC part of the Group.
Re-organisations of group companies have produced similar types of adjustments in previous years.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 was 5 199 million for NV and 2 063 million for PLC.

With effect from 1 October 2007, Unilever and Remgro Ltd. reached agreement to reorganise their respective shareholdings in the Unilever businesses in South Africa and Israel.
In the reorganised shareholding Unilever has a majority share in a single South African business and fully owns the Unilever Israel foods and home and personal care business.
As a result of this transaction, Unilever has reported a profit on disposal of 214 million and goodwill of 168 million.
On 1 January 2007, Unilever completed the restructuring of its Portuguese businesses.
The result of the reorganisation is that Unilever now has a 55% share of the combined Portuguese entity, called Unilever Jernimo Martins.
The combined business includes the foods and home and personal care businesses.
The remaining 45% interest is held by Jernimo Martins Group.
The structure of the agreement is such that there is joint control of the newly formed entity and so it is accounted for by Unilever as a joint venture.
Other disposals in 2007 included the sale of local Brazilian margarine brands.
In addition, to further develop our healthy heart brand margarine, Becel, in Brazil we have established a joint venture with Perdigo.
During 2007, we have also announced the disposal of Boursin to Le Groupe Bel for 400 million, and the disposal of Lawrys and Adolphs seasoning blends and marinades business to McCormick and Company for US $605 million.

No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2005, 2006 and 2007 under the North America Performance Share Programme, the Restricted Share Plan or the cash-settled share-based retention plan.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using option pricing models and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
Disclosures, including a description of the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of options and the weighted average information, are given below for each type of plan, for NV, PLC and New York shares on a combined basis.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of Executive Option Plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all Plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.

i Share Option Plans Unilever has All-Employee Share Option Plans in 15 countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, and with a share save element in South Africa and the United Kingdom.
Generally the vesting periods range between three and five years and the maximum term is five years.
Under the Executive Option Plans options are granted to key employees of the Group on a discretionary basis.
The exercise price is the market price at the date of grant.
The options become exercisable after a three-year period from the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years.
In view of the introduction of the Global Performance Share Plan in 2005, no further grants were made under the Executive Option Plans after 2005.
The plans consist of the NV, the PLC Plans and the North America Programme which is covered by the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
The fair value per option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing method.
The expected option terms are based on historic data.
Figures for expected volatility are set with regard to historic volatility over the last six years.
The expected dividend yield is based on the dividend yield in the year of grant.
Forfeiture rates are set annually with regard to historic forfeiture rates.
Managers working in India can participate in an Executive Option Plan relating to Hindustan Unilever Limiteds shares.
As these are neither NV nor PLC shares, no gures for this plan are disclosed in this note, but the fair value costs for 2007 were 1 million 2006: 1 million: 2005: 2 million and are included in the costs of share option plans in the table above.
