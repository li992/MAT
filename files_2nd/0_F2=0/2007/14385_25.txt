Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and all applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention.
As permitted by Section 230 3 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys entity profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses have not been presented.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures not to disclose transactions with other members of the Smiths Group.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the retranslation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the term of the lease.
Where a leasehold property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, provision is made for the anticipated future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the relevant assets by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.
In general, the rates used are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2%: Short leasehold property over the period of the lease: Plant, machinery, etc.
10% to 20%: Motor vehicles 25%: Tools and other equipment 10% to 33%.
Fixed asset investments The Companys investment in shares in group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises.
Financial instruments The policies disclosed in the Group accounting policies on pages 49 to 54 for recognition, measurement and presentation of financial instruments are applied in the Company accounts.
Where there are no differences between the disclosures required for the Group and the Company in respect of a class of financial instruments an appropriate cross reference is made to the Group accounts.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed as at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as disclosed in the accounts, arising from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the accounts.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been declared or an obligation is present to distribute past earnings.
Deferred tax is not recognised on any fixed assets that have been revalued unless there is a binding agreement to sell the asset.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.

The Company has adopted the amendment to FRS 17 issued in December 2006.
The comparative information disclosed has been expanded to comply with the changes to the disclosure requirements.
The restatement of quoted equity valuations from mid-market to current bid price has not materially affected the reported assets of the pension scheme.
Share-based Payment The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised as an expense over the vesting period to reflect the value of the employee services received.
The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using established option pricing models, principally Binomial models.
The probability of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which include profitability targets, is used to estimate the number of share options which are likely to vest.
For cash-settled share-based payment a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance sheet date.
For equity settled share based payment the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20: Share-based Payment, no charge had been recognised for grants of equity instruments made before 7 November 2002.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised.
The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
