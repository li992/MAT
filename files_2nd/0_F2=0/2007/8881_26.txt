Notes to the Company Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 36.
Significant Accounting Policies The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by that Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Applicable Accounting Standards.
No profit and loss account is presented as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Companys profit for the year, determined in accordance with the Act was 52,539,000 2006 - 64,561,000.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain fixed assets and derivative financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The opening balances have been restated to reflect the inclusion of the actual dollar sterling exchange rate at 31 December 2006 and the fair value of the related derivative instruments in accordance with FRS26.
The impact of this in the prior year is a recognised gain of 6,470,000 as shown in note 46.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed asset balances are shown at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives.
The principal rates employed are: Heritable and freehold property excluding land 2.5% on written down value Leasehold land and buildings equal annual instalments over lease term Other plant and machinery 15% on written down value 6.67%, 10%, 20%, 25% and 33% straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% straight line basis Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Listed investments are shown at current market valuation.
Upward revaluations are credited to the revaluation reserve.
Downward revaluations in excess of any previous upward revaluations are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows: Cost incurred in bringing materials to their present location and condition comprises: a raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis: and b work in progress at cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads.
Net realisable value comprises selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the Profit and Loss Account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Profit and Loss Account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which such assets can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Profit and Loss Account, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based benefits to certain employees.
These share-based payments are measured at their fair value at the date of grant and the fair value of expected shares is expensed to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model, as amended to take account of the Directors best estimate of probable share vesting and exercise.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recorded as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved.
In the Companys financial statements, dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised as assets in the period in which the dividends are approved.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of that instrument.
The Companys activities and funding structure give rise to some exposure to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company uses interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge these exposures.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised directly in a hedging and translation reserve.
Retirement Benefit Obligations The Company participates in a Group-wide scheme, the Johnston Press Pension Plan, which has a defined benefit section providing benefits based on final pensionable pay and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The pension costs for the defined contribution section are charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of contributions due in respect of the financial year.
In relation to the defined benefit section of the scheme, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reliable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, the Company accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of the defined benefit section represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the year.
