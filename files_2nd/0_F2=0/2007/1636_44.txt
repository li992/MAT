AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2007 Financial statements IFRS Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 24 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon during the current and preceding year: Accelerated Retirement capital Land and benefit Intangible Share allowances buildings obligations assets options Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2006 369 249 1,039 3,784 634 1,810 919 Credit to income statement 452 7 627 516 47 47 442 Credit to equity 811 16 173 1,000 At 31 March 2007 83 242 1,223 3,268 697 2,030 523 A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 3,105 3,795 Deferred tax assets 3,628 2,876 523 919 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,247,000 2006 2,317,000 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictably of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised deferred tax assets are losses of 498,000 2006 929,000 that will expire over the years 2010 to 2014 2006 2009 to 2013.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 16,500,000 2006 14,958,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.

The employees contributions are xed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance sheet dates.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of 8,500,000 in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004. b German dened benefit schemes There are two dened benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH.
