Factors that may affect future tax charges At 30 April 2007 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 156,000 2006 1,740,000 on taxable losses which are available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable pro ts.
A deferred tax asset has not been provided on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make taxable revenue pro ts in the future and it is not liable to tax on its capital gains.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget statement on 21 March 2007, announced a number of proposed changes to tax legislation, including a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from April 2008.
These proposed changes in legislation are subject to enactment.
No estimate of its financial effect has been made for this financial information.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
