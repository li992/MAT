JoinT venTures As at 31 December 2007 certain property and corporate interests, being jointly controlled entities, have been proportionately consolidated, and these are set out in the following table: group share % investments Brent Cross Shopping Centre 41.2 Brent South Retail Park 40.6 Bristol Alliance Limited Partnership 50 Cricklewood Regeneration Limited 50 Queensgate Limited Partnership 50 The Bull Ring Limited Partnership 33.33 The Grosvenor Street Limited Partnership 50 The London Wall Limited Partnership 50 The Martineau Galleries Limited Partnership 33.33 The Moor House Limited Partnership 66.67 The Oracle Limited Partnership 50 The Shires Limited Partnership 60 The West Quay Limited Partnership 50 developments 125 OBS Limited Partnership 50 Bishopsgate Goodsyard Regeneration Limited 50 Paddington Triangle 50 Wensum Developments Limited 50 The groups interests in The Moor House Limited Partnership and The Shires Limited Partnership do not confer the majority of voting rights nor the right to exercise dominant influence over the partnerships.
Instead the partnerships are under the joint control of Hammerson and its respective partners.
Consequently, the groups interests are accounted for by proportional consolidation and are not treated as subsidiaries.
In July 2007, the group disposed of its 50% interest in 9 place Vendme SCI and sold a 50% interest in WestQuay Shopping Centre, which it had wholly owned.
The following summarised income statements and balance sheets show the proportion of the groups results, assets and liabilities which are derived from its joint ventures: 088 Annual Report 2007 13.
