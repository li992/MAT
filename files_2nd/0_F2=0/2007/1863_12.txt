This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balances are debtors with a carrying amount of 24.0 million 2006: 30.6 million which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and investments.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international creditrating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The average lease term is six years for equipment and 22 years for FBO leasehold improvements.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the average effective borrowing rate for continuing operations was 5.4% 2006: 6.3%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date or vary based on prevailing interest rates.
All of the Groups finance lease obligations are denominated in US Dollars.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.

This cash flow interest rate risk is managed by the use of interest rate swaps in accordance with pre-agreed policies and authority limits.
As at 31 December 2007 32% of the Groups borrowings were fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% for a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
All bank loans are unsecured.
The effective interest rates on borrowings are not materially different from their nominal interest rates.
The Group has one principal bank loan which is a multicurrency revolving credit facility dated 7 September 2007 for $900.0 million 2006: 550.0 million which is due to expire in September 2012.
This facility is an unsecured committed bank facility.
At 31 December 2007, the group had available $77.7 million 2006: 77.7 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

Derivative financial instruments continued Collateral As part of the Groups management of its insurable risks a proportion of this risk is managed through self insurance programmes operated by its captive insurance company, BBA Aviation Insurances Limited, based in the Isle of Man.
This Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims.
The cash balances held by the Company are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents.
As is usual practice for captive insurance companies, some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities standby letters of credit that have been provided to certain external insurance companies.
The table below details the contractual amount and maturity of the cash balances that have been pledged as collateral for these contingent liabilities: 2007 2006 US Dollar Sterling Total US Dollar Sterling Total m m m m m m BBA Aviation Insurances Limited 10.2 6.0 16.2 10.3 6.0 16.3 Total 10.2 6.0 16.2 10.3 6.0 16.3 Current Less than 1 year 10.2 6.0 16.2 10.3 6.0 16.3 Total current 10.2 6.0 16.2 10.3 6.0 16.3 The standby letters of credit have been issued via bank facilities that BBA Aviation Insurances Limited has in place.
The amount of these facilities correspond to the amounts pledged as detailed in the table above.
The amounts pledged are usually for less than one year and are secured by a general counter indemnity and a letter of set-off in the banks standard form over the cash balances of the captive insurance company.
Financial Risk Factors Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall our risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seeks to manage and minimise potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with our subsidiaries.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined further as described on page 37.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to certain covenant requirements under its $900 million revolving credit facility.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of these risks and the management of these risks includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign Exchange Risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency of the countries in which the operations are located.
The Group is, therefore, exposed to foreign currency translation risk from the translation of these overseas operations financial statements into Sterling.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the income statement translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect.
However, it is Groups policy to maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies of our operating subsidiaries and it is Groups policy that the foreign currency balance sheet translation risk is hedged between 50% and 85% through the use of foreign currency denominated loans, cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The translation foreign exchange risk is measured by monitoring the value of the overseas net assets excluding internal group financial loans which are reported monthly as part of the management accounts reporting process and verifying these values against the net assets reported by the overseas subsidiaries within their statutory accounts.

Derivative financial instruments continued The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as net investment hedges amounting to a payable of 6.6 million 2006: receivable 13.4 million has been deferred in equity.
The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% but where cash forecasts are uncertain, we generally cover a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows depending on the certainty of the cash flows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting monthly reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy.
The pre-determined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with our relationship banks.

An amount of 2.1 million 2006: 2.0 million has been transferred to the income statement in respect of contracts that matured during the period.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to 7.8 million 2006: 1.6 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
ii Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Groups debt and cash balances are based on floating interest rates which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
A very small proportion of the Groups borrowings 3.0 million is issued at fixed interest rates and, therefore, overall the Group is not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to use a combination of debt and derivative instruments to fix proportions of the exposure for varying periods based upon the maturity profile and the expectation of future interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to the movements on these floating interest rates.
During 2007 and 2006, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge cash flow interest rate risk as follows: 2007 2006 Fixed Floating Net Fixed Floating Net Rate Rate Debt Rate Rate Debt m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 99.2 99.2 156.5 156.5 Derivative effect cross currency swaps 6.6 6.6 13.4 13.4 Bank overdrafts 21.9 21.9 26.0 26.0 Borrowings 3.0 417.4 420.4 3.9 468.4 472.3 Finance leases 25.5 25.5 28.5 28.5 Net Debt 3.0 372.2 375.2 3.9 353.0 356.9 Derivative effect cash flow interest rate swaps 191.0 190.0 1.0 193.9 197.2 3.3 Net debt post derivative effect 194.0 182.2 376.2 197.8 155.8 353.6 Mark-to-market gain has been included within the floating rate amount.
This is not booked to net debt but is recorded as a net gain in reserves.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value of 1.0 million 2006: 3.3 million has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 1.7 million 2006: 1.7 million has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
Credit Risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities we are exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets that we have and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments continued Treasury Related Credit Risk The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties of strong credit standing as measured by financial credit ratings.
All Treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities to the Group.
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively, bank accounts, surplus cash and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Each counterparty that we use for Treasury related activity, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and Treasury related activity that can be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
All counterparties must also have a short-term rating of A1 P1.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
As at 31 December 2007 and 2006, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These are within the maximum limits permissible under our policy and these exposures are continually monitored and reported.
No individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity and we do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
Commercial Related Credit Risk The Groups exposure to commercial related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled in a number of different ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 13.
Liquidity Risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses, the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of highly rated banks to mitigate this risk further.
Headroom on our facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and liquidity.
In 2007, the Group refinanced its main borrowing facility in order to put in place a new five year facility maturing in 2012 on similar or improved terms with a core group of its relationship banks.

Derivative financial instruments continued Sensitivity Analysis as at 31 December 2007 Financial instruments affected by market risk are derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative instruments as cash and debt balances are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: all debt is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rates affects a full twelve-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances of plc company only as at the balance sheet date and assumed this is the position for a full twelve-month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used as over the last three years floating $ interest rates have moved by an average 1% per annum.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, before the effects of tax.

The charges to the restructuring provision relate principally to the closure of a number of commercial cargo handling operations.
Discontinued operations represents a provision for environmental liabilities relating to businesses that have been disposed of by the Group in prior years.
The liabilities have been assessed over a remaining period of 25 years.
The provision of 20.1 million is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of 13.3 million 2006: 13.3 million, which are included within trade and other receivables due after one year in note 13.
The charges to the provision relate to businesses which were disposed during the year.
Environmental provisions relate to environmental liabilities within businesses that have been acquired by the Group.
The liabilities have an expected life of up to five years.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was 7.4 million 2006: 10.1 million of which 3.0 million 2006: 6.1 million was in respect of foreign schemes.
This includes 3.1 million 2006: 5.4 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2004.
A valuation as at 31 March 2007 is currently underway.
The Groups foreign pension schemes mainly relate to a number of funded final salary defined benefit pension arrangements in North America.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
The Group also operates a number of plans in North America which principally cover healthcare and life assurance benefits for its retirees.
The costs of these other post-retirement benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries.
In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2007.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America Rest of World p. a.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued For the UK plan, the mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the UK plan as at 31 December 2007 are as follows: Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65 year old years 21.1 21.9 Life expectancy for a 65 year old in 15 years years 23.0 23.2 For the US post retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 7%, which is assumed to reduce by 1% per annum to 5% in 2009 onwards.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are 3.6 million 2006: 3.2 million of listed investments which are held in trust for the benefit of members of the North American schemes.
These amounts are not included within the assets shown above as they are not controlled by the pension schemes in question.

The long-term rates of return on bonds and other investments are set in line with market yields available at the balance sheet date.
The long-term rate of return on equities is derived from considering current risk free rates of return with the addition of a future risk premium.
The overall expected return on assets in the analysis of the income statement is based on weighted average returns using the above rates for each asset class, and taking into account the asset allocation in each plan.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax liabilities 26.0 15.7 Deferred tax assets 5.8 20.2 15.7 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and other temporary differences of 5.0 million 2006: 10.1 million available for offset against future profits.
These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
Included in the unrecognised deferred tax asset is 0.1 million 2006: 1.0 million relating to losses due to expire in 2008 which relates to losses which will expire by 2012.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2.5 million 2006: 13.6 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

Share-based payments Equity-settled share option scheme The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average of the middle market price of a BBA Aviation share up to five dealing days prior to the date of grant.
The vesting period is generally three to four years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted Number average Number average of share exercise of share exercise options price options price Outstanding at the beginning of the year 16,216,396 275p 26,800,344 224p Granted during the year 3,640,640 254p 2,660,200 288p Exercised during the year 1,217,312 225p 5,892,492 163p Lapsed during the year 3,437,283 307p 7,351,656 187p Outstanding at the end of the year 15,202,441 226p 16,216,396 275p Exercisable at the end of the year 6,308,200 171p 6,723,623 263p The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 277p.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had weighted average remaining contractual life of 84 months and an exercise price range of 1.53 to 4.85.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 190p.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and calculated using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
These include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The inputs into the models were as follows: 2007 2006 Issued in Issued in March 2003 Others March 2003 Others Weighted average share price pence 153 269 153 280 Weighted average exercise price pence 153 247 153 281 Expected volatility % 12.9% 20.7% 14.3% 20.1% Expected life months 11 26 14 26 Risk-free rate % 4.0% 4.7% 4.0% 4.6% Expected dividends % 4.6% 3.4% 4.8% 3.4% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the period of time equivalent to the remaining contractual life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2.0 million 2006: 0.4 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Cash-settled share-based payments The Group issues to certain employees share appreciation rights SARs that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of exercise.
The fair value of the SARs is determined using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
These include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations and use the assumptions noted in the above table.
The Group has recorded liabilities of 0.9 million 2006: 2.2 million and a total credit of 1.1 million 2006: credit 2.8 million.
The total intrinsic value of vested SARs at 31 December 2007 was nil 2006: 0.1 million.
Other share-based payment plan The Companys savings-related share option scheme is open to all eligible UK employees.
Options are granted at a price equal to the average three day middle market price of a BBA Aviation ordinary share prior to the date of grant, less 20%.
Options are granted under three or five year SAYE contracts.
The maximum overall employee contribution is 250 per month.
Pursuant to this plan, the Group issued 101,219 ordinary shares in 2007 2006: 703,040 shares.

91 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27.
Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year which are detailed in the Directors Report on page 40.
The directors have performed an exercise to establish the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of these acquisitions.
The net assets acquired and the goodwill arising on these acquisitions are as set out below: Adjustments Provisional to align Fair Book accounting value to Value Revaluations policies BBA Group m m m m Intangible assets 1.3 17.0 18.3 Property, plant and equipment 14.6 1.4 16.0 Inventories 4.0 0.9 3.1 Receivables 3.2 3.2 Payables 1.6 1.1 0.2 2.9 Taxation 0.6 0.6 Net borrowings 0.1 0.1 Net assets liabilities 22.0 17.3 1.1 38.2 Goodwill 40.1 Total consideration including deferred consideration 78.3 Deferred consideration 2.8 Net cash consideration paid in 2007 75.5 The fair values set out above are provisional and may be subject to amendment on finalisation of the fair value exercises.
In the period since acquisition to 31 December 2007, the revenue from acquisitions was 20.5 million and profit for the year was 2.1 million.
The acquisitions noted above contributed 0.4 million to the Groups net operating cash flows, paid nil in respect of net returns on investment and servicing of finance, paid nil in respect of taxation, paid 0.2 million in respect of capital expenditure and utilised nil for investing activities.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2007, total revenue for the period from acquisitions would have been 52.2 million, and profit for the year would have been 5.2 million.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability arising from the expansion of the Groups FBO network, the integration of new products into our Landing Gear and Hydraulics portfolio, together with anticipated future operating synergies.
Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and environmental claims in BBA Nonwovens North America and BBA Aviation respectively.
Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No BBA company has manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been named as defendants to asbestos related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2007, BBAs costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately 5.0 million.
BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of resolving such claims.
Whilst the outcome of these claims are, by their nature uncertain, the directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, will materially exceed the insurance coverage or amounts provided as shown in note 19, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Following the authorisation of the US Department of Transport to provide reimbursement of up to 8 million to fixed-based general aviation operators and others at five metropolitan Washington DC area airports and the issue of the proposed rules of eligibility for reimbursement in October 2007, management consider that the receipt in 2008 of compensation following the closure of Washington Reagan National Airport in 2001 is probable.
Whilst we believe that a significant proportion of the 8 million compensation should be due to BBA, as our base at Washington Reagan took the majority of business aviation traffic in the Washington DC area, it is not practicable to estimate accurately a specific amount.
Events after the balance sheet date On 18 January 2008 the Group announced the closure of CSE Engineering, an engineering business based at Oxford Airport.
The expected losses related to the liquidation of the assets and liabilities of this business have been reflected in the results for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Since the Group was not irrevocably committed to the closure at the balance sheet date, the cash costs of closure have not been accrued in 2007 in accordance with IAS 10 Post Balance Sheet Events.
These cash costs will be expensed in 2008 when incurred, and are expected to amount to approximately 2 million.
On 22 February 2008 the Group announced that it had agreed to purchase the assets of Hawker Beechcraft Services Incs Line Service Operations for a cash consideration of $128.5 million 64.9 million on a debt and cash free basis.
Closing of the deal is expected in May 2008 and is subject to Hart-Scott Rodino and other third party approvals.
