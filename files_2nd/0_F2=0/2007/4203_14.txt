Consulting actuaries WatsonWyatt Limited 82 Shareholder information Shareholder information 83 Five year record In 2005 the Group adopted IFRS and in accordance with the requirements of IFRS, 2004 figures were restated.
Restatement of earlier years is not required under IFRS and accordingly the information presented below for 2003 is as prepared under UK GAAP.
The main adjustment that would be required to comply with IFRS would be with regard to the recognition of pension fund liabilities on the balance sheet.
The pension fund prepayment shown on the summarised balance sheet in 2003 would have been replaced with a net liability as measured under IAS 19.
Earnings exclude exceptional items in order to present a clearer year on year comparison.
