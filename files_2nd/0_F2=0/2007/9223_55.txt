35 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group has a number of lease agreements that pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings.
The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be summarised as follows: Lease terms Shop leases are typically 15 years with a tenant only break clause at 10 years and rent reviews every five years.
Other leases are typically between three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease arrangements, although there were occasionally non-financial restrictions on leases preventing the Group from opening or operating another competing hotel for a specified number of years.
Subleases The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.
