Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 115.7m 2006: 68.7m to Marstons Inns and Taverns formerly Pathfinder Pubs, 85.4m 2006: 69.2m to Marstons Pub Company formerly The Union Pub Company and 16.7m 2006: 10.4m to Marstons Beer Company formerly WDB Brands.
Goodwill has been allocated to business segments based on the extent to which the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The key assumptions used are the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of 9.0% 2006: 9.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets of 2.0% 2006: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term inflation rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and estimates of competitors strategy.
Following the above impairment tests, no impairment of goodwill was required in the current or prior period.
