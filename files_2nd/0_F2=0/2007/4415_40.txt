It uses a combination of derivative and conventional financial instruments to manage these underlying financial risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of Boardapproved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and monitored by the Treasury Committee.
These guidelines include bank exposure limits and hedge cover levels for each of the key areas of treasury risk.
The Board and Treasury Committee receive monthly reports of the activities of Group treasury.
The main elements of treasury activity to manage relevant financial risks are outlined below: Currency risk The Group publishes its financial statements in sterling and conducts business in several foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange movements affecting the Groups sterling transaction costs, and the translation of results and underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The Group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies, primarily the euro.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of net borrowings held in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are recognised in the income statement.
The Group adopts a centralised approach to foreign exchange risk management.
Permission of Group treasury is required before a foreign exchange transaction may be undertaken.
Any foreign exchange transaction must be demonstrably linked to an underlying exposure and the hedge is monitored through the life of the transaction to ensure it remains effective and appropriate.
Treasury policy requires that all transactional foreign exchange risk relating to committed transactions must be hedged.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised at the same time as the underlying transaction.
Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk on its primary credit facility and manages this exposure using interest rates swaps.
The treasury policy requires that at least 30 per cent, but no more than 70 per cent, of borrowings in the Group must be fixed.
Credit risk Interest rate swap, foreign exchange and deposit transactions are only entered into with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better.
Group treasury monitors the credit exposure of the Group to its counterparties and the credit ratings of those counterparties on a monthly basis.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.

Net fair values of derivative financial instruments The net fair values of derivative financial instruments and designated cash flow hedges at the balance sheet date were: 2006 2007 restated Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 4.0 0.8 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.1 0.1 Foreign currency swap 0.1 Embedded derivatives 0.2 Options over shares in Group undertakings 1.0 2.4 Total derivative financial instruments 5.2 0.1 2.4 1.0 Derivative financial instruments current 0.2 0.1 1.4 1.0 Options over shares in Group undertakings The fair value of options over shares in Group undertakings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Hedges Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge expected future purchases in US dollars for which the Group has firm commitments.
The contracts typically cover periods of less than six months.
The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the firm commitments.
Where cash flow hedges on forward foreign currency contracts are assessed to be effective, the movement in the fair value is taken to the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by marking the contracts to market using prevailing forward exchange rates.
At 31 January 2007, a net unrealised loss of 0.1m 2006: 0.1m with a related deferred tax asset was included within equity in respect of these contracts.
At 31 January 2007, the value of future US dollar purchases hedged was $47.5m 2006: $44.7m.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 January 2007 was1300m 2006:1500m.
At 31 January 2007, the fixed interest rate on the swaps was 3.16 per cent 2006: 3.15 per cent and the floating rate was 3.6 per cent 2006: 2.54 per cent and they expire in February 2009.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market rates.
Where the hedge on the interest rate swap is assessed to be effective, the movement in the fair value is taken to the hedging reserve within equity.
At 31 January, a net unrealised gain of 2.7m 2006: loss of 0.8m with a related deferred tax liability of 1.2m 2006: asset of 0.2m was included within equity in respect of the interest rate swaps.
