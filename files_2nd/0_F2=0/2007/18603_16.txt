The 2007 Finance Act gained Royal Assent during 2007.
This Act reduced the corporation tax rate to 28% from 1 April 2008.
As the Act is substantially enacted as at 30 September 2007, deferred tax has been calculated at this lower rate.
This has resulted in a reduction in deferred tax of 6.0m which has been taken through the income statement.
Factors that may affect future tax charges The group has not taken all of the benefit in relation to capital losses brought forward and available for offset against subsequent capital gains arising as this has yet to be formally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
If it is found that all the capital losses are available for offset against capital gains, then provisions of up to 26m would be released over the coming years.

If approved, this will result in a further distribution of 5.3m and it will be paid on 18 February 2008 to shareholders on the register on 18 January 2008.
The 2007 interim dividend of 2.06p per share was paid in July 2007.
This gives a total dividend for 2007 of 6.18p per share compared to 5.62p per share in 2006, an increase of 10%.
FINANCIALS 104 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007 notes to the financial statements continued 16 Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the group and held both in trust and as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its convertible bond and its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIS, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2007 was the end of the contingency period.
The profit for the year is adjusted to add back the after tax interest cost on the liability component of the convertible bond.

Impairment has been tested by comparing the carrying amount of each businesss assets and liabilities with its recoverable amount, being its value in use.
The value in use has been calculated by reference to the cash flow projections for each business.
The discount rate used for the 2007 test was 6.87%.
In 2006 goodwill of 6.4m was impaired and an impairment loss for this amount was recognised in the 2006 income statement.
Of this amount, the largest portion, 5.8m, related to goodwill that had arisen on acquisition of the City North Group in 2005.
Goodwill had arisen primarily from the difference between how deferred tax had been calculated for accounts purposes and the value ascribed to it in the acquisition negotiations.
The value of goodwill was supported by the fact that the taxation cash flows will arise in future years and the discounted value of this cash flow is significantly less than the tax actually provided.
During 2006, however, when the assets from the City North acquisition were transferred to the JPUT, that tax was actually crystallised so that the carrying value of the goodwill could be no longer justified by reference to future cash flows.
The gross amount of goodwill and accumulated impairment losses as at 30 September 2007 were 23.8m and 6.4m respectively.

The loan is to be used by the fund to invest in real estate joint venture partnerships.
The loan bears interest at 5% per annum above EURIBOR and is repayable within one year.
The loan is secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets in the fund.
26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments Financial risk management The group is subject to a number of financial risks, in particular, interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks.
Interest rate risk The group does not take trading positions in financial instruments but uses them to minimise the risk of exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
The majority of the groups debt is subject to protective swaps, caps or collars or is maintained at fixed rates of interest see note 28.
To protect itself against interest rate risk the groups treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowings.
As at 30 September 2007, 74% 2006: 66% of the groups net borrowings was economically hedged.
Liquidity risk The group maintains a combination of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that it has sufficient available funds for ongoing operations and to meet planned future investments.
In addition, the core business in particular is very cash generative from its gross rents and sales of trading properties.
In adverse trading conditions, new acquisitions can be stopped and, consequently, we are able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
Foreign currency risk The group invests in property acquired in a currency other than pounds sterling.
In such situations, it is the groups policy to take out loans in the same currency to act as a natural hedge against currency uctuations.
FINANCIALS 112 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007 notes to the financial statements continued 26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Credit risk The group has significant financial assets held in cash and bank balances and in trade and other receivables.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are shown net of provisions for impairment see note 25.
Such provisions are made when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The group has no individually material risk as its exposure is spread over a large number of tenants.

Unless previously redeemed, converted, purchased or cancelled the bond is convertible at any time up to 12 May 2014 into fully paid up ordinary shares at a conversion price of 8.64.
The convertible bond is a compound financial instrument and the carrying amount has been allocated to its equity and liability components in the group balance sheet.
The liability component has been determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component.
The discount rate used for this was a rate of 7.5% compounded semi-annually.
The liability component has been deducted from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the residual element has been assigned to the equity component.
The liability element is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The analysis of the loans and borrowings in the above tables is before deducting unamortised issue costs relating to the raising of the loan finance.

Pension arrangements for directors are disclosed in the report of the remuneration committee and the directors remuneration report on page 67.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group.
Dened benefit scheme In addition to the above, the group also operates a dened benefit pension scheme, the BPT Retirement Benets Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager.
Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualied actuary using the attained age method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2004 with the valuation as at 1 July 2007 currently in progress.
This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger plc in 2003.
The actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2004 was based on the main actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.5% per annum, salary increases of 5% per annum and ination-linked increases to pensions in deferment of 2.5% per annum.
The scheme assets were valued at 10.5m and scheme liabilities at 13.3m, a funding level of 79%.
The actuary has recommended an employer contribution rate of 28.5% in order to eliminate the deficiency over the expected working lifetimes of the members.
The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2004 in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995.
The value of assets of the scheme was determined at 101% of the liabilities of the scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members and to employee contributions in 2003.
Accordingly, there is no current service cost for the scheme.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the 1 July 2004 actuarial valuation but have been updated to 30 September 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.

In addition, the company operates a SAYE share option scheme available to employees.
For share options outstanding at the end of the year, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.17 years 2006: 1.39 years.
Further details of the above option schemes is provided in the report of the remuneration committee and directors remuneration report from pages 62 to 69.
FINANCIALS 127 34 Share-based payments The group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a long-term incentive scheme LTIS and a save as you earn SAYE scheme.
For awards under the 2007 LTIS, one third are subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance condition measured over three years from the date of grant and two thirds are subject to annual growth in Net Net Net Asset value NNNAV measured over three years from the date of grant.
One third of the awards, therefore, are subject to a market-based performance condition and these have been fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The remaining two thirds of the awards are subject to a non-market-based performance condition and have been fair valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Awards under the LTIS for 2006 and prior are subject to market performance conditions under which the total shareholder return TSR of the company is measured against a peer group.
There is no vesting below median performance.
If the company TSR equals the median of the peer group 40% will vest.
If the groups TSR is equal to or greater than the upper quartile TSR of the peer group, 100% will vest.
At points between the median and upper quartile of the peer group there is pro rata vesting between 40% and 100%.
Awards under the LTIS for 2006 and prior have been fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
Awards under the SAYE scheme have been fair valued using a Black Scholes model.
The Monte Carlo simulation model takes into account the market-based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares or options expected to vest.
No subsequent adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares or options that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met.
Adjustments are, however, made for leavers and, once adjusted for leavers, the total expense for each equity-settled award is spread over the vesting period.
For awards under the 2007 LTIS which are subject to a non-market-based performance condition, the number of shares or options expected to vest is adjusted during the vesting period based on the best available estimate.
On vesting, the estimate will be revised to equal the number of shares or options that will ultimately vest.
Options under the SAYE scheme are fair valued at the date of grant and are not adjusted thereafter.
Adjustment is made, however, for assumptions about leavers.
The tables below summarise the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above schemes.
For the LTIS, the number of shares or options is shown for both the maximum number at award and the latest number as at 30 September 2007 after adjustment for leavers.
This same information is given for the SAYE schemes.
The share-based payments charge recognised in the income statement is 1.0m 2006: 0.9m.
Of this amount, 0.7m 2006: 0.4m related to the LTIS share awards, 0.2 2006: 0.4m to the LTIS options and 0.1m 2006: 0.1m to the SAYE options.
SAYE options awarded in August 2007 under the 2007 scheme have not been fair valued in the accounts to 30 September 2007 as the cost to be charged to the income statement is very small in the context of materiality to the group results.
Accordingly, the cost of calculating the fair value exceeded the benefit to be obtained.
The 2007 SAYE awards will be valued in 2008 along with the 2008 LTIS awards.
Movements in options and options exercisable as at 30 September 2007 are shown in note 33.

Goodwill in all of the acquisitions other than CAT, arises primarily from the difference between how deferred tax is calculated for accounts purposes and the value ascribed to it in acquisition negotiations.
Goodwill relating to CAT reflects the value ascribed to the associated market position and the distribution arrangements that were acquired with the portfolio.
The following fair value adjustments were made on acquisition: For The Portland Group Inventories trading property was fair valued at the date of acquisition at 18.4m an increase of 8.6m over entity book value.
For The CAT Group and The ELM Group, an adjustment was made for properties held with lifetime leases to gross up the value of investment property to its vacant possession value with a corresponding adjustment to establish a deferred rent creditor representing the lifetime lease payments received but not yet credited to the income statement.
These adjustments were for 26.1m and 2.8m respectively.
