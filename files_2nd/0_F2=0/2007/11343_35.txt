A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of trading tax losses as it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise these benefits.
The new tax rate will be substantively enacted when the Bill for the 2007 Finance Act is passed later this year.
This will have an impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities and future tax charges.
Opening balance has been restated, see note 13.
