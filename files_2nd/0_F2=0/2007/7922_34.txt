20 Convertible bonds On 18 December 2007, US$191.3 million 5.95% convertible bonds were issued by Imperial Energy Finance Jersey Limited IEFJL at an issue price of 18.19 per note with a fixed rate of US$:GBP 2.0624.
The bonds are first convertible into exchangeable redeemable preference shares to be issued by IEFJL, which will then be automatically exchanged for ordinary shares of the Company.
On issue, the loan notes were convertible at 5,099,286 shares per loan note.
The conversion price is at a 45% premium over the volume weighted average share price of the ordinary shares at the date the convertible loan notes were issued.
If the notes have not been converted, they may be redeemed at any time on or after 2 January 2013 at par.
Interest of 5.95% will be paid semi-annually up until that settlement date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible loan notes have been split between the liability element and an equity component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company, as follows: $000 Nominal value of convertible bonds issued net of issue costs 186,675 Equity component 34,300 Liability component at date of issue 152,375 Interest and amortisation of issue costs 533 Coupon interest 411 Liability component at 31 December 2007 152,497 The equity component of US$34.3 million has been credited to equity reserve see consolidated statements of changes in equity.
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 10.15% to the liability component for the 13 day period since the loan notes were issued.
The liability component is measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the carrying amount of the liability component at the date of issue and the amount reported in the balance sheet at 31 December 2007 represents the effective interest rate less interest paid to that date.
The rights issue announced in April 2008 has no adverse impact upon the rights of the holders of the convertible loan notes.
The rights issue announced on 2 April 2008 see note 30 has no impact upon the rights of the holders of the convertible loan notes as under the terms of the convertible bonds, adjustments will be made to take account of the number of ordinary shares to be issued on conversion of the convertible bonds to take account of the rights issue.
