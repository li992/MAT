FRS 26 IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement has been applied but does not have any effect.
Accounting reference date The accounting period of the Company ends on the Sunday falling between 29 January and 4 February each year.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Depreciation The policy of the Company is to provide depreciation at rates which are calculated to write off the cost less residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal annual instalments.
The rates applied are: Freehold land 0% Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2.5% Short lease buildings Over lease period Plant, equipment and vehicles 15-33% Assets under construction 0% Income-generating units are reviewed for indications of impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If there are indications then a test is performed on the unit affected to assess its recoverable amount against carrying value.
A unit impaired is written down to the higher of value in use or its net realisable value.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the Companys profit and loss account on an accruals basis except for interest costs that are directly attributable to the construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building.
Capitalisation of interest ceases when the property is ready for use.
Pension costs The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The defined benefit scheme is no longer open to new members.
A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
A defined benefit scheme is one that is not a defined contribution scheme.
Pension benefits under defined benefit schemes are defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and employees final compensation package.
The Company defined benefit retirement scheme is funded by contributions from the Company and members.
Pension scheme assets, which are held in separate trustee administered funds, are valued at market rates.
Pension scheme obligations are measured at discounted present value applying the assumptions set out in note 38.
The operating and financing costs of the scheme are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.

Rental payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance.

The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2005 and were updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the periods to 4 February 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.
Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes liabilities were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Rate of increases in salaries 4.25 5.45% 4.25 5.25% 4.25 5.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.20% 3.00% 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.00% 4.75% 5.25% Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.00% 3.00% Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics.
The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00% Bonds 5.00% 4.25% 5.00% Property 6.00% 7.00% N A Cash 5.25% 4.50% 4.75% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Equities 288.3 252.4 205.2 Bonds 43.3 34.4 11.5 Property 35.4 0.7 Cash 1.0 18.9 10.9 Total market value of assets 368.0 306.4 227.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 406.1 381.3 299.6 Deficit in the scheme pension liability 38.1 74.9 72.0 Related deferred tax asset 11.4 22.5 21.6 Net pension liability 26.7 52.4 50.4 04 Report 2007 66-80. qxp 16 4 07 5:20 pm Page 73 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2007 73 38 Pension liabilities continued The movement in the deficit during the period was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Deficit in the scheme at start of period 74.9 72.0 67.9 Current service cost 24.4 21.6 19.5 Contributions 24.9 24.9 24.1 Other finance income costs 2.2 0.8 1.1 Actuarial gain loss 34.1 7.0 7.6 Deficit in the scheme at end of period 38.1 74.9 72.0 Profit and loss account impact The following amounts have been charged in arriving at profit for the period in respect of pension costs: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Current service cost 24.4 21.6 19.5 Expected return on pension scheme assets 21.2 17.2 13.1 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 19.0 16.4 14.2 22.2 20.8 20.6 Amounts recognised directly to profit and loss account reserves 2007 2006 2005 m m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 16.1 35.4 7.5 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 6.4 4.2 1.8 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 11.6 46.6 16.9 Actuarial gain loss 34.1 7.0 7.6 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 m m m m m History of experience gains and losses Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount 16.1 35.4 7.5 24.9 44.0 Percentage of scheme assets 4.4% 11.6% 3.3% 13.9% 37.3% Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities: Amount 6.4 4.2 1.8 3.4 2.6 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 1.6% 1.1% 0.6% 1.4% 1.8% Effects of changes in the demographic and financial assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities: Amount 11.6 46.6 16.9 70.6 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 2.9% 12.2% 5.6% 28.6% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount 34.1 7.0 7.6 49.1 41.4 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 8.4% 1.8% 2.5% 19.9% 28.3% 04 Report 2007 66-80. qxp 17 4 07 11:21 am Page 74 74 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 4 February 2007 38 Pension liabilities continued Defined contribution pension scheme Employees joining the Company after September 2000 are no longer eligible to gain automatic entry into the final salary pension scheme.
