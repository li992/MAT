Notes to the Group Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations collectively IFRSs endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Standards and interpretations effective in 2007 IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classication and valuation of the Groups financial instruments.
New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: Effective date IAS 23 Borrowing costs 1 January 2009 IFRS 8 Operating segments 1 January 2009 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC 14 The limit on a dened benefit asset, minimum funding requirements 1 January 2008 and their interaction Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will need to expand the disclosure in relation to segmental analysis.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the Groups profit or net assets.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding that confers more than half of the voting rights.
The consolidated income statement included the results of business purchased from the effective date of acquisition.
Revenue recognition Revenue for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group revenue.
Revenue is recognised during the rental period in which the equipment and related services are utilised by the customer.
72 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Segmental reporting Aggrekos primary reporting format relates to geographical segments comprising Northern Europe, Continental Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia-Pacic and South America together the Groups Local business and a global segment of International Power Projects IPP.
IPP is managed as a single segment, with the deployment of assets varying from year to year depending on the location of projects.
The geographical risks and rewards within IPP are signicantly different from those within the Groups Local business.
Aggrekos secondary reporting format relates to the Groups two business types detailed above, namely the Local business and International Power Projects business.
The Local business focuses on smaller, more frequently occurring events, whereas the International Power Projects business concentrates on large contracts, which can arise anywhere in the world.
The risks and rewards of the Groups operations are determined by the different geographical locations.
This is reected by the Groups divisional management and organisational structure and the Groups internal financial reporting systems.
The segmental analysis in Note 4 to the Accounts is based on location of assets.
Central administrative costs are allocated between segments based on revenue.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classied as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Exceptional items Items are classied as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Group to be material and are different from events or transactions which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to be properly understood.
Details of the exceptional items are provided in Note 7 to the financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The periods of depreciation are reviewed on an annual basis and the principal periods used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years Capital grants Capital grants in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment are netted against the cost of the related asset and this cost is depreciated in accordance with the policy above.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 73 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition of each asset over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships: 10 years: Non-compete agreements: over the life of the non-compete agreements.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is currently deemed to be 4 years.
The useful life of intangible assets is reviewed on an annual basis.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment reviews, both annually and when there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For the purpose of the impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are amortised depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates functional currency.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Gains and losses from the settlement of transactions and gains and losses on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in the income statement.
74 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in forward foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recorded and subsequently measured at fair value, which is calculated using standard industry valuation techniques in conjunction with observable market data.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates and the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The treatment of changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative classication.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions or commitments cash ow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash ow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in finance costs in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in finance costs in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit and loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in finance costs in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to finance costs in the income statement.
Overseas net investment hedges Certain foreign currency borrowings are designated as hedges of the Groups overseas net investments, which are denominated in the functional currency of the reporting operation.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings are taken to equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains and losses are dealt with through other income in the income statement.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 75 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, negative goodwill nor from the acquisition of an asset, which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current intention to remit such earnings.
Current tax The charge for the current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the FIFO or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes the cost of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
When the reasons for a write-down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the write-down is reversed.
Employee benets Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benets are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benets, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a dened benefit pension scheme and a number of dened contribution pensions schemes.
The cost for the year for the dened benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the expected future working lifetime of active members with actuarial updates to the valuation being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current service cost of the pension charge as well as the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are included in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
Contributions to dened contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become chargeable.
76 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or large and old outstanding balances are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outow of resources that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account the time value of money where material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inow of economic benets is probable.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee-share and option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for employee sharesave options and using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model for Executive share options.
Own shares held under trust for the Groups employee share schemes are classed as Treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on disposal of Treasury shares.
Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
This denition is also used for the cashow statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Key assumptions and significant judgements The Group use estimates and make judgements in the preparation of its Accounts.
The most sensitive areas affecting the Accounts are discussed below.
Property, plant and equipment The property, plant and equipment used in the business is mainly the rental eet which has a depreciation life typically of between 8 and 10 years.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives allocated to each type of asset.
Assets lives are reviewed regularly and changed when necessary to reect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 77 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill arising on acquisition of assets and subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 also requires the identication of other acquired intangible assets.
The techniques used to value these intangible assets are in line with internationally used models but do require the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation period adopted for these items and, potentially, by any differences between estimated and actual circumstances related to individual intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The impairment review calculations require the use of estimates related to the future profitability and cash generating ability of the acquired assets.
Pensions Pension arrangements vary for our employees and schemes reect best practice and regulation in each country.
The Group operates a dened benefit scheme for UK employees, which was closed to new employees joining the group after 1 April 2002: most of the other schemes in operation around the world are varieties of dened contribution schemes.
Under IAS 19: Employee Benets Aggreko has recognised a pre-tax pension deficit of 8.1 million at 31 December 2007 2006: 13.1 million.
The decrease in the pension deficit is mainly as a result of the additional contributions made by the Company during the year of 5.0 million in line with the Recovery Plan agreed for the Scheme following the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2005.
These improvements were partially offset by a lower than expected return on scheme assets.
The main assumptions used in IAS 19 valuation for the previous two years are shown in Note 28 of the Accounts.
Taxation The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
Estimation of the tax charge requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax treatment of certain items which will only be resolved once nally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk.
The Group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise, and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identied and managed.
The treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes and transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Monthly reports are provided to senior management and treasury operations are subject to periodic internal and external review.
Liquidity, funding and capital management The Groups objective with respect to managing capital is to maintain a balance sheet structure that is both efficient in terms of providing long term returns to shareholders and safeguards the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
As appropriate the Group can choose to adjust its capital structure by varying the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, returns of capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or the level of capital expenditure.
The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium-term.
These facilities are primarily in the form of committed bank facilities totalling 358.0 million at 31 December 2007, arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The financial covenants attached to these facilities are that operating profit should be no less than 3 times interest, and net debt should be no more than 3 times EBITDA.
The Group does not consider that the financial covenants contained in the facilities are restrictive to its operations.
Net debt amounted to 202.6 million at 31 December 2007 and at that date undrawn committed facilities were 145.8 million.
78 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the exposure to interest rates by ensuring an appropriate balance of xed and oating rates.
The Groups primary funding is at oating rates through its bank facilities.
In order to manage the associated interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary the mix of xed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2007, 150.9 million of the net debt of 202.6 million was at xed rates of interest resulting in a xed to oating rate net debt ratio of 75:25.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis by applying forecast interest rates to the Groups forecast net debt prole after taking into account its existing hedges.
The Group also calculates the impact on profit and loss of a dened interest rate shift for all currencies.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on profit or loss of a -100 basis-point shift, after taking into account existing hedges, would be 0.8 million 2006: 0.7 million.
The sensitivity analysis is performed on a monthly basis and is reported to the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries into sterling.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising, the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are currently drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US dollar and euro, as well as sterling.
The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate in order to hedge net currency ows.
The negative impact of currency, largely due to the movement in the dollar, decreased our revenues by 27.7 million 2006: 3.8 million and trading profit by 5.9 million 2006: 0.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The Group monitors the impact of exchange closely and regularly carries out sensitivity analysis.
For every 5 cents movement in the dollar to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate impact of 1 2.7 million 2006: 2.0 million in trading profit in terms of translation.
For every 5 cents movement in the euro to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate impact of 0.4 million 2006: 0.3 million in trading profit in terms of translation.
Currency translation also gave rise to a 5.6 million increase in reserves as a result of year on year movements in the exchange rates 2006: decrease of 20.5 million.
For every 5 cents movement in the dollar and euro, there is an approximate impact in equity of 3.7 million and 1.4 million respectively 2006: 3.8 million and 1.0 million, arising from the currency translation of external borrowings which are being used as a net investment hedge.
Credit risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amounts and their duration depending on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
In the case of financial assets exposed to credit risk, the carrying amount in the balance sheet, net of any applicable provisions for loss, represents the amount exposed to credit risk.
Management of trade receivables The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
Some of the contracts undertaken in our IPP business are substantial, and are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk prole and debtor-position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bank guarantees and various types of insurance.
On large contracts, all such arrangements are approved at Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
Insurance The Group operates a policy of buying cover where possible for material risks from the global insurance market, whilst self-insuring risks which would not have a material impact on the Group as a whole.
The Group monitors its insurance arrangements in such a way to ensure the quality and extent of cover.
1 Trading profit represents operating profit before gain on sale of property, plant and equipment.

Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 85 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts which are treated as cancelled.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
2007 2006 profit for the year million 80.7 46.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue million 266.2 265.4 Adjustment for share options million 2.8 2.4 Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue million 269.0 267.8 Diluted earnings per share pence 30.02 17.25 Aggreko plc assesses the performance of the Group by adjusting earnings per share, calculated in accordance with IAS 33, to exclude items it considers to be material and non-recurring and believes that the exclusion of such items provides a better comparison of business performance.
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share on a basis which excludes exceptional items is based on the following adjusted earnings: 2007 2006 million million profit for the year 80.7 46.2 Exclude exceptional items net of attributable taxation 7.0 Adjusted earnings 80.7 53.2 An adjusted earnings per share gure is presented below.

Accordingly, the fair values previously reported at 31 December 2006 have been restated with a decrease in goodwill of 9.1 million, analysed as follows: million Property, plant and equipment 0.8 Trade and other receivables 3.4 Inventories 0.7 Trade and other payables 7.4 Deferred taxation 0.2 9.1 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units CGUs as follows: million Northern Europe 2.6 Continental Europe 7.3 North America 19.1 Middle East, Asia-Pacic, South America 5.8 Local business 34.8 International Power Projects 3.2 Group 38.0 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
The discount rate used for business valuations was 8.5% after tax based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
Before tax the estimated discount rate was 11.6%.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
Values in use were determined using forecast cash ows which were based on experience as well as on future expected market trends.
A terminal cash ow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0%.
As at 31 December 2007, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs signicantly exceeded their net asset value.

90 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 17 Trade and other receivables continued Local business Our Local business serves customers in Northern Europe, Continental Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia-Pacic and South America.
It focuses on the smaller, more frequently occurring events and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business as there a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in the Local business.
International Power Projects IPP Our International Power Projects business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Most projects in this business are worth over 1 million and some can be worth over 10 million.
Customers are mainly in developing countries and include power utilities, governments, armed forces, oil companies and mining companies.
In addition the majority of the contracts above are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk prole and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, guarantees and various types of insurance.
On large contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the IPP business.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2007 for our IPP business was 36.6 million 2006: 26.2 million.
Within this balance receivable balances totalling 26.9 million 2006: 18.8 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
The risk associated with the remaining 9.7 million 2006: 7.4 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable in a cost effective manner.

The principal benchmark rates for oating rate financial liabilities are the relevant LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate rates for sterling, US dollars and euros and liabilities are normally xed in advance for periods between one and three months.
The weighted average interest rate on xed debt is derived from the xed leg of each interest rate swap.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 150.9 million 2006: 121.0 million of borrowings in the above table as xed rate.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2007 was 150.9 million 2006: 121.0 million.

96 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 22 Deferred tax continued No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences of nil in both years relate to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries which pay tax at rates less than the UK rate of tax.
If the earnings were remitted, no tax would be payable 2006: nil, due to the availability of foreign tax credits for offset.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 4.4 million 2006: 2.1 million of which 4.4 million 2006: 1.5 million relates to carried forward tax losses and nil 2006: 0.6 million relates to other temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets of 1.3 million 2006: 0.1 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period as our forecasts indicate that these assets will reverse in the near future.

Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 97 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 23 Share capital continued Share options The options under the Savings-Related Share Option Schemes have been granted at a discount of 20% on the share price calculated over the three days prior to the date of invitation to participate, mature after three to five years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% of the share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the Executive Share Option Scheme are normally only exercisable once three years have elapsed from date of grant and lapse after ten years.
All Executive Options are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
For Executive Share Options granted prior to 25 April 2001, at the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the Companys TSR since the date of grant of the option is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys annual EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
There is no legal obligation upon the Company to satisfy the options existing under the Savings-Related and Executive Share Option Schemes other than by the allotment of new issue shares.
It is intended to satisfy awards to US participants in the Long-term Incentive Plan by the allotment of new shares.
The maximum award would be made on achieving the performance targets set out on page 57 of the Remuneration Report.
Aggreko has taken the IFRS 1 exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to options that were granted after 7 November 2002 and were not vested at 1 January 2005.
For the Sharesave and US Stock Options the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used.
As the Executive options have share price based performance conditions attached the Monte Carlo option-pricing model was used.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free interest rate is the expected return on UK Gilts of a similar life.

102 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 28 Pension commitments continued United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, dened benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of individual trustees.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 4.6% Growth in average pay levels 4.3% Increase in pensions 2.8% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 18,400,000 which was sufficient to cover 53% of the benets that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the valuation at 31 December 2005, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
During 2006 the Company contributions for benets building up in the future were increased to 31.5% of pensionable earnings and from 1 January 2007 the Company contribution was 25.4% of pensionable earnings.
From 1 January 2007 future benets are accrued, on a Career Average basis hence the change to the required contribution rate.
To address the Scheme deficit the Company made an additional contribution of 3.5 million in 2006 and 4.0 million in 2007 and the Company plans to make further additional contributions of 4.0 million in 2008 and 0.5 million per annum until the year ended 31 December 2015.
Employee contributions increased from 5% to 6% of pensionable earnings from 1 January 2007.
The Scheme was closed to all new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
For new employees joining after 1 April 2002, a dened contribution scheme has been introduced.
Contributions of 0.4 million were paid to this scheme during the year 2006: 0.2 million.
There are no outstanding or prepaid balances at the year end.
An update of the Scheme was carried out by a qualied independent actuary using the latest available information for the purposes of this statement.
The major assumptions used in this update by the actuary were: 31 Dec 2007 31 Dec 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.9% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.4% 3.1% Discount rate 5.5% 5.0% Ination assumption 3.4% 3.1% Expected return on Scheme assets 6.0% 6.1% Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years Men 22.8 21.3 Women 26.0 24.2 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years Men 24.9 23.1 Women 27.9 25.9 The expected return on Scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
