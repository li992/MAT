Report and accounts 2007 ITV plc 61 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The Group accounts consolidate those of ITV plc, the Company, a company domiciled in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interests in associates and jointly controlled entities.
As required by EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 the Groups accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS.
The accounts are principally prepared on the historical cost basis.
Areas where other bases are applied are identified in the accounting policies below.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures which introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
The impact on the 2006 comparatives has been to reclassify interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts from accruals and deferred income to derivative financial instruments see note 25 for further details and to reclassify amounts between financing income and financing costs.
IFRS 8 Operating segments has been adopted by the Group in 2007.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which the segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
This has resulted in an increase in the number of reportable segments presented.
In addition, the segments are reported in a manner that is consistent with information provided to the chief operating decision maker.
Comparatives for 2006 have been restated.
The accounting policies set out below, except as noted above, have been applied consistently in presenting the consolidated financial information.
1.2 Revenue recognition Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and consists of sales of goods and services to third parties.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control of the goods sold and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Key classes of revenue are recognised on the following bases: Advertising and sponsorship on transmission Programme production on delivery Programme rights when contracted and available for exploitation Participation revenues as the service is provided Revenue on barter transactions is recognised only when the goods or services being exchanged are of a dissimilar nature.
1.3 Segmental analysis Operating segments are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Management Committee.
The Management Committee comprises the executive directors.
1.4 Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity but is not control or joint control over those policies.
These investments are accounted for using the equity method.
1.5 Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or consumption in, the course of the Groups operating cycle.
All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
1.6 Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under such leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is provided as appropriate.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years Leasehold properties improvements shorter of residual lease term or 60 years Vehicles, equipment and fittings 3 to 20 years 62 ITV plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued 1.7 Intangible assets Business combinations and goodwill All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair values of net assets acquired are made within 12 months of the acquisition date where original fair values were determined provisionally.
These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
For business combinations prior to this date, but after 30 September 1998, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less amortisation up to 31 December 2003.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to cash-generating units.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 September 1998 was recognised as a deduction from equity.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation except those identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination which are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations less accumulated amortisation.
Identifiable intangible assets are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
The useful lives and amortisation methods for each major class of intangible asset are as follows: Film libraries Sum of digits 20 years Licences Straight line 11 to 17 years Brands Straight line up to 11 years Customer contracts Straight line up to 6 years Customer relationships Straight line 5 to 10 years Software development costs Straight line 3 to 5 years 1.8 Distribution rights Programme rights acquired primarily for the purposes of distribution are classified within the balance sheet as non-current assets.
They are recognised initially at cost and charged through the income statement over either a three or five year period depending on genre.
1.9 Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets comprise gilts and equity securities which do not meet the definition of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates.
They are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised directly in the available for sale reserve in equity, unless the loss is a permanent impairment when it is recorded in the income statement.
1.10 Impairment of assets Non financial assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Non financial assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Where an asset such as goodwill relates to more than one cash-generating unit, impairment is tested against the cash flows of the group of cash-generating units related to that asset.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
1.11 Foreign currencies Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements in each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the functional currency of the respective group entity at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into the functional currency of the respective group entity at the average rate of exchange ruling during the financial period.
Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in the translation reserve in equity.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve within equity.
In respect of all foreign operations only those translation differences arising since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity as permitted under IFRS 1.
On disposal of an investment in a foreign operation the associated translation reserve balance is released to the income statement.
Report and accounts 2007 ITV plc 63 1 Accounting policies continued 1.12 Exceptional items Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the income statement, are items which due to their material and non-recurring nature have been classified separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the accounts and to show more accurately the underlying profits of the Group.
1.13 Programme rights Where programming, sports rights and film rights are acquired for the primary purpose of broadcasting, these are recognised within current assets.
Assets are recognised when the Group controls, in substance, the respective assets and the risks and rewards associated with them.
For acquired programme rights assets are recognised as payments are made and are recognised in full when the acquired programming is available for transmission.
Programming produced internally, either for the purpose of broadcasting or to be sold in the normal course of the Groups operating cycle, is recognised within current assets at production cost.
Programme costs and rights, including those acquired under sale and leaseback arrangements, are written off to operating costs in full on first transmission except certain film rights which are written off over a number of transmissions.
Programme costs and rights not yet written off at the balance sheet date are included on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise the principal and accrued interest are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreement is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
Sale and leaseback obligations are secured against an equivalent cash balance held within cash and cash equivalents.
1.14 Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to their original terms.
1.15 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits with maturity of less than or equal to three months from the date of acquisition and cash held to meet certain finance lease commitments.
1.16 Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value.
1.17 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and that the amount can be measured reliably.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability based on an appropriate gilt rate.
1.18 Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost.
The difference between cost and redemption value is recorded in the income statement over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Where the Group has identified that any such liabilities result in a mismatch between the accounting liability and the related derivative, the Group has adopted the fair value option provision of IAS 39 revised to eliminate this accounting mismatch.
Management consider that this fair value treatment is more appropriate than amortised cost as the movements in these financial instruments largely offset each other and, as a result, they are managed on an aggregated basis.
The effect of this is that the Group recognises any such financial liabilities at fair value in all periods subsequent to initial recognition, with resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement.
1.19 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than continuing use, they are available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet and classified as current assets or liabilities with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
1.20 Taxation The tax charge for the period comprises both current and deferred tax and is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set off.
64 ITV plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued 1.21 Employee benefits Defined contribution schemes Obligations under the Groups defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit schemes The Groups obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model as appropriate taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
Non market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
1.22 ITV shares held by Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBTs are included in the Groups accounts.
In particular, the EBTs purchases of shares in ITV plc are debited directly to equity.
1.23 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in reserves.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair value change and interest income expense are not separated.
1.24 Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity in the period in which they are declared and approved by the Companys shareholders.
1.25 Investment income Investment income comprises dividends received from the Groups investments.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the Groups right to receive payments is established.
1.26 Net financing costs Net financing costs principally comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement and the expected return on pension scheme assets net of the interest cost on liabilities.
1.27 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of accounting estimates and judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements have been disclosed under the relevant note or accounting policy for each area where disclosure is required.
Principally these are measurements of defined benefit obligations, valuation of acquired intangible assets, measurement of the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing goodwill, fair value of derivatives, utilisation of tax losses and provisions.
Report and accounts 2007 ITV plc 65 1 Accounting policies continued 1.28 Application of new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments to existing EU endorsed standards and interpretations New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 Relevant to the Groups results IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures and Requires extensive disclosures about the significance of financial instruments the Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of for an entitys financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures disclosures on the nature and the extent of risks.
IFRS 7 and amended IAS 1 requires additional disclosures with respect to financial instruments and share capital.
It does not have any impact on the valuation of the Group or Companys financial instruments.
The 2006 comparative information has been restated as a result of the introduction of IFRS 7 Replaces IAS 14, Segment reporting.
The new standard requires a management Operating segments IFRS 8 adopted approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that early by the Group used for internal reporting purposes.
This has resulted in an increase in the number of reportable segments presented Neither of these new interpretations has had a material effect on the Groups results in 2007 Not relevant to the Groups results IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based payment Requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to establish whether they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.

This IFRIC was endorsed by the EU in June 2007 66 ITV plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts 2 Operating segmental information Management has determined the reportable segments based on the reports reviewed by the Management Committee.
The Management Committee considers the business primarily from a product perspective.
The reportable segments are therefore Broadcasting, Global Content, Online and Other.
All of the segments reported meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8.
Broadcasting is responsible for commissioning and scheduling programmes on the ITV channels, marketing and programme publicity.
It derives its revenue primarily from the sale of advertising airtime and sponsorship.
Other sources of revenue are from premium rate services and the digital terrestrial multiplex SDN.
The Broadcasting segment also includes the investments in SMG plc.
Global Content derives its revenue primarily from ITV Productions in the UK a commercial production company and the businesses in ITV Worldwide.
A proportion of revenue is generated internally via programme sales to the Broadcasting segment.
ITV Worldwide is made up of Granada International, Granada Ventures and international production centres in America, Germany and Australia.
Granada International sells programming worldwide.
Granada Ventures is a distributor of DVD entertainment in the UK and exploits merchandising and licensing worldwide.
Online derives its revenue from two main areas: broadband and mobile.
Mobile manages ITVs mobile portal and arranges distribution of ITVs channels and content on mobile networks.
Other comprises the Groups 100% interest in Carlton Screen Advertising, which sells cinema screen advertising in the UK, and its 50% interest in Screenvision, which operates cinema screen advertising businesses in continental Europe and the United States.
The segment information provided to the Management Committee for the reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 is as follows: Broadcasting Global Content Online Other Consolidated 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m m m m m m m Total segment revenue 1,750 1,801 564 632 33 23 67 80 2,414 2,536 Intersegment revenue 12 4 320 351 332 355 Revenue from external customers 1,738 1,797 244 281 33 23 67 80 2,082 2,181 EBITA before exceptional items 244 296 90 88 12 1 11 10 311 375 Share of profit loss from joint ventures and associated undertakings 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 8 Total segment assets 3,934 3,948 590 528 419 418 84 120 5,027 5,014 Total assets includes: Investments in associates and joint ventures 12 7 4 2 61 59 79 66 Additions to noncurrent assets other than financial instruments 46 33 68 24 8 21 1 1 123 79 Total segment liabilities 389 381 226 242 74 64 18 11 707 698 Sales between segments are carried out at arms length.
The revenue from external parties reported to the Management Committee is measured in a manner consistent with the income statement.
Income statement and balance sheet allocations between reportable segments are performed on a consistent basis with the exception of pension costs, which are allocated, and pension assets and liabilities, which are not.
This reflects the basis of reporting to the Management Committee.
The Management Committee assesses the performance of the reportable segments based on a measure of EBITA before exceptional items.
This measurement basis excludes the effect of non-recurring income and expenditure.
Amortisation, investment income and share of profits of joint ventures and associates are also excluded as they are not reflective of the underlying business.
Net financing costs are not allocated to segments as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury and taxation functions, which manage the cash and taxation position of the Group.
A reconciliation of EBITA before exceptional items to profit before tax is provided as follows: 2007 2006 m m EBITA before exceptional items 311 375 Exceptional items 35 35 Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 84 76 Net financing costs 33 26 Share of profits of joint ventures and associated undertakings 2 8 Investment income 1 3 Gain on sale of properties exceptional items 9 4 Gain on sale and impairment of subsidiaries and investments exceptional items 17 35 Profit before tax 188 288 Report and accounts 2007 ITV plc 67 2 Operating segmental information continued The amounts provided to the Management Committee with respect to total assets are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.

Operating exceptional items include 18 million in respect of reimbursements, fines and other costs associated with issues arising on the use of premium rate interactive services in programming on ITV and GMTV as follows: 2007 m Reimbursements and associated costs: ITV 10 GMTV 6 Fines: GMTV 2 18 Reimbursements and associated costs include the amounts that GMTV has donated and ITV plans to donate to charities.
The terms of ITV plc's broadcasting licences require compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, which requires that competitions are to be run fairly, and that viewers must not be misled.
If the Code is breached, it is open to the regulator in serious cases to impose sanctions, including a fine of up to 5% of the licensee's qualifying revenue.
For free to air commercial broadcasters, such as ITV and GMTV its 75% subsidiary undertaking, qualifying revenue in this context effectively equates to total advertising and sponsorship revenues.
In setting the level of fine in the past, the regulator has taken into account whether or not problems were systemic or one-off: the period over which problems persisted: action taken by the broadcaster once problems came to light: and the amount of revenues generated by the affected services.
The regulator has also levied multiple fines on broadcasters where more than one programme was affected.
Ofcom has been provided with details of all the instances in ITVs programmes which have given rise to reimbursement.
However at the date of approval of these accounts, the regulator has not yet confirmed the level of any fine that may be imposed and it is not possible to reliably estimate the level of fine that might be imposed by Ofcom in this context.
Therefore no provision for a fine on ITV is included in these accounts.
The regulatory process is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008 and any subsequent fine will be included in the 2008 results as an operating exceptional item.
2006 exceptional items have been restated to include the gain on sale of properties of 4 million.
2006 exceptional items included a charge of 23 million, including 17 million staff costs, in respect of reorganisation and restructuring costs including the closure of the Bristol and childrens programme production centres, the continuation of the regional news consolidation programme and redundancy and share costs arising from the restructuring of the senior management team.
A liquidation settlement of 2 million was received from the liquidators of the Shop!
Fees of 14 million were incurred in respect of the two unsolicited takeover approaches received in 2006.
2006 exceptional items also included a 35 million net gain from the sale of subsidiaries and the sale and impairment of investments.
This included the profit on disposal of the stakes in Seven Network 29 million and TV3 40 million, the loss on sale of the education business 12 million and an impairment of the holding in SMG Plc, which is held within the Broadcasting segment 22 million following a significant decline in its share price.
70 ITV plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts 6 Pension schemes The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension scheme assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the fund is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
Defined contribution schemes Total contributions recognised as an expense in relation to defined contribution schemes during 2007 were 3 million 2006: 2 million.
Defined benefit schemes The Group provides retirement benefits to some of its former and approximately 30% of current monthly paid employees through defined benefit schemes.
The Groups main scheme was formed from a merger of a number of schemes on 31 January 2006.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on basic salary at retirement.
During 2007, the Group made significant changes to the scheme benefit structure in respect of future service benefits.
These changes involved a combination of an increase in normal retirement age, a reduction in the rate of benefit accrual and increased member contributions.
Members were given the option to elect for alternative benefits with an equivalent adjustment to member contributions.
Benefits accrued up to the date of the change were unaffected.
The liabilities of the defined benefit scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
This amount is reflected in the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an actuarial measure of the present value of benefits for service already rendered but differs from the projected unit method in that it includes an allowance for early leaver statutory revaluations rather than projected earning increases.
At the balance sheet date the accumulated benefit obligation was 2,550 million 2006: 2,580 million.
The assets and liabilities of all the Groups defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2007 under IAS 19 as explained in detail in this note were 2,491 million and 2,603 million respectively, resulting in a net deficit in the defined benefit schemes of 112 million.
An alternative method of valuation to the projected unit method is a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme.
The Group estimates the shortfall in the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date is 1,100 million 2006: 1,500 million.
The statutory funding objective is that the scheme has sufficient and appropriate assets to pay its benefits as they fall due.
This is a long term target.
Future contributions will always be set at least at the level required to satisfy the statutory funding objective.
The general principles adopted by the trustees are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuations in respect of the Groups retirement benefits funds was performed by an independent actuary for the Trustees of the ITV Pension Scheme and was carried out as at 1 January 2005.
The Groups main scheme, formed by merger on 31 January 2006, consists of three sections, A, B and C. The first triennial valuation of section A is due at 1 January 2008.
The first triennial valuation of the other sections was completed as at 1 January 2007.
The Group will monitor funding levels annually.
The levels of ongoing contributions are based on the current service costs and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group estimates the present value of the duration of UK scheme liabilities will on average fall due over 16 years.

The scheme assets are shown below by major category along with the associated expected rates of return.

Exposure through the different asset classes is obtained through a combination of executing swaps and investing in physical assets.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.
Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government.
The risk of default on these is very small.
The trustees also hold corporate bonds and other fixed interest securities.
There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies.
The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity investments.
The investment return related to these is variable and they are generally considered much riskier investments.
It is generally accepted that the yield on equity investments will contain a premium the equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of the risk premium.
The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation for 2008 to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The fair value of the scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets as at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 and target allocations for 2008 are set out below.
The benchmark for 2008 is to hold broadly 55% equities and 45% bonds.
The majority of the equities held by the scheme are in international blue chip entities.
The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of equities, with a target of broadly one-third of equities being held in the UK and twothirds of equities held overseas.
Within the bond portfolio the aim is to hold 50% of the portfolio in government bonds gilts and 50% of the portfolio in corporate bonds and other fixed interest securities.
Asset allocation is currently being reviewed by the Trustees.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31 December 2007 was 167 million 2006: 176 million.
Planned 2008 2007 2006 as a percentage of total scheme assets Equities and property 55% 52% 61% Bonds 45% 44% 38% Other 0% 4% 1% The principal assumptions used in the scheme valuations at the balance sheet date were: 2007 2006 Rate of general increase in salaries 4.65% 4.25% Rate of increase in pension payment LPI 5% pension increases 3.30% 2.90% Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.40% 3.00% Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.70% 5.12% Inflation 3.40% 3.00% Report and accounts 2007 ITV plc 73 6 Pension schemes continued IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality fixed income investments.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
The discount rate has been based on the yield available on AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The expected rate of inflation is an important building block for salary growth and pension increase assumption.
A rate of inflation is implied by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds.
However, differences in demand for these can distort this implied figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
The Group has used PA92 tables with mortality projected to 2020 for pensioner members and to 2035 for non-pensioner members.
Using these tables, the assumed life expectations on retirement are: 2007 2007 2006 2006 Retiring today at age 60 65 60 65 Males 24.4 19.8 24.4 19.8 Females 27.4 22.8 27.4 22.8 Retiring in 20 years Males 25.5 20.8 25.5 20.8 Females 28.4 23.7 28.4 23.7 The tables above reflect published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the results of investigations into the mortality experience of scheme members.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are set out below.
The illustrations consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
The Company liability is the difference between the scheme liabilities and the scheme assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the scheme liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value so there is no net effect on the company liability.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 8% Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 7% Rate of salary growth Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 1% Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 3% Normal contributions into the schemes in 2008 are expected to be in the region of 12 million assuming current contribution rates continue as agreed with the scheme trustees.

The Granada Media and Granada Commitment schemes mirror the ITV scheme summarised in the Remuneration report on page 108.
The main differences are as follows: Twenty-five per cent of the Matching Awards will vest for median ranking, and maximum vesting will occur only for first or second position out of a comparator group of 16 international media companies.
The performance condition is tested in respect of 50% of the Matching Award on the second anniversary of the date of grant.
Any portion of the Matching Award which does not vest at that time may vest when the condition is again tested on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
Performance conditions were adjusted to take account of the merger.
The Granada, Carlton and ITV Sharesave schemes are Inland Revenue Approved SAYE schemes.
The Granada Media, Granada and Carlton Executive Share Option schemes are Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved schemes with three year performance periods.
For all options granted before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisfied on the merger of Carlton and Granada.
The performance conditions for options granted from December 2002 measure TSR against a comparator group of 16 international media companies permitting exercise only if ITV is ranked above the median of this group.
The comparator group for Carlton is the FTSE 100 at date of grant.
The Carlton Equity Participation Plan operated under similar terms to the ITV Commitment Scheme summarised in the Remuneration report on page 108.
For all awards made before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisfied on the merger of Carlton and Granada.
For awards made from December 2002, 33% of the Matching Award vests at median with maximum vesting occurring when ITV ranks in the upper quartile against a comparator group of UK media companies.
The performance condition is tested on 1 April following the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Any proportion that does not vest at this time may vest when the condition is tested on 1 April following the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
The Carlton Deferred Annual Bonus Plan operated as a share award scheme.
Shares were purchased from bonus entitlements and held in trust for a three year period.
Matching shares were awarded and vest after four years.
Exercises can be satisfied by market purchase or by new issue shares.
However it is company practice to satisfy all option exercises where possible by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees Benefit Trust rather than by issuing new shares.
ITV plc was formed on the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications Plc on 2 February 2004.
The awards made under the Commitment Scheme, Performance Share Plan and Turnaround Plan all have market based performance conditions which are taken into account in the fair value calculation using a Monte Carlo pricing model.
The Black-Scholes model is used to value the Sharesave Schemes as these do not have any market performance conditions.
Share-based payment charges totalled 15 million in 2007 2006: 22 million.
Of these nil has been shown within exceptional items 2006: 7 million.

The underlying tax rate on profits, after adjusting for the irregular tax effects caused by issues such as exceptional items, impairments, joint ventures and associates and adjustments in respect of prior periods, is 31% 2006: 30%.
The current tax expense for the prior year is reduced primarily as a consequence of the reversal of temporary differences on which deferred tax assets previously were recognised relating to pension scheme deficits and funding payments.
A tax expense totalling 47 million 2006: expense of 4 million has been recognised directly in equity representing a current tax credit of nil 2006: credit of 2 million and a deferred tax expense of 47 million 2006: expense of 6 million.

Of this benefit 4 million has been taken through the income statement and net 2 million through equity in accordance with IAS 12.
At 31 December 2007 total deferred tax assets are 55 million 2006: 143 million and total deferred tax liabilities are 130 million 2006: 150 million.
Deferred tax assets estimated at 0.6 billion and 0.1 billion 2006: 0.6 billion and 0.1 billion in respect of capital losses and loan relationship deficits respectively, have not been recognised due to uncertainties as to amount and whether gain or income will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territory against which such losses could be utilised.
For the same reasons, deferred tax assets in respect of overseas losses of 10 million 2006: 10 million which time expire between 2017 and 2026 have not been recognised.

80 ITV plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts 13 Intangible assets continued Amortisation of intangible assets is shown within operating costs in the income statement.
The 28 million impairment charge in 2007 related to the Carlton Screen Advertising cash-generating unit and was a result of structural changes in the cinema advertising market.
Of the 28 million, 20 million of the impairment relates to goodwill and 8 million to other intangible assets.
In calculating this impairment, growth rates and discount rates consistent with those noted below have been used, and calculations have been made on a value in use basis, using cash flow projections over the next seven years.
Carlton Screen Advertising is part of the Other operations segment.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2007 2006 m m Broadcasting 2,707 2,707 Global Content 301 267 Online 376 375 GMTV 54 54 CSA 20 3,438 3,423 The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations.
Those calculations use cash flow projections based on estimated operating results for the next seven years.
Cash flows in perpetuity are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11.9% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
The key assumptions and the approach to determining the cash flows of the cashgenerating units are: Broadcasting The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the television share of advertising market, share of commercial impacts, programme costs and the level of PSB savings.
The key assumptions in assessing the recoverable amount of this goodwill are the growth in the total television market and ITVs share within that market.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of long term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates.
It is also assumed that ITV is able to renew its broadcasting licences in 2014.
Broadcasting goodwill exceeds its carrying amount by approximately 200 million.
In assessing the recoverable amount, ITVs TV advertising revenues are assumed to have a net present value of 14.8 billion.
Goodwill would be equal to its carrying amount if there were a 12% fall in the growth rate assumed in assessing ITVs TV advertising revenues.
Global Content The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include turnover growth, share of total network programme budget obtained, and margin growth.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry forecasts and in-house estimates of growth rates.
Online The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include page impressions, unique users, average dwell time for unique users, number of videos streamed and advertising rates.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of industry forecasts and in-house estimates of growth rates.
GMTV The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the television share of advertising market, share of commercial impacts, and programme costs.

The individually impaired receivables relate mainly to the Broadcasting and Global Content segments due to concerns over their recoverability.
Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2007 2006 m m At 1 January 16 14 Provision for receivables impairment 3 7 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible 3 3 Unused amounts reversed 7 2 At 31 December 9 16 Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are not considered impaired.
As at 31 December 2007, trade receivables of 86 million 2006: 87 million were past due but not impaired.
Of this 46 million 2006: 31 million relates to customers in the Broadcasting segment where the Group has supplier and customer relationships.
An amount of 40 million 2006: 39 million is included in trade payables relating to these customers.
The remainder relates to a number of customers for whom there is no recent history of default.

In August 2007 ITV purchased a 100 million senior note issued by UBS AG UBS under UBS Euro Note Programme.
The note matures in March 2009 and the investment return is a function of short term interest rates across six major currencies.
For the period to 31 December 2007 the return earned was 8.6% on a per annum basis.
The note is designated as a held to maturity investment and, although it is the Groups intention to hold this note to maturity, it can be redeemed for cash before the maturity date, subject to agreement by UBS.
At the time of issue of the 500 million bond the Group took out a cross-currency interest rate swap to economically hedge Euro interest rate and foreign exchange exposure.
As at 31 December 2007 the currency element of the swap is a 30 million asset 2006: 1 million asset and this offsets the exchange rate movement of the bond.
The interest element of the swap is a 7 million liability 2006: 4 million liability resulting in an overall net asset total at 31 December 2007 of 23 million 2006: 3 million net liability total.
The 356 million exchangeable bond and 200 million Eurobond matured in 2007.
Included within non-cash movements in 2006 is the movement of the 200 million Eurobond into amounts payable in less than one year based on its payment due date.
Report and accounts 2007 ITV plc 85 23 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk, and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board for managing each of these risks including levels of authority on the type and use of financial instruments.
Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures.
The treasury department reports regularly to the Audit Committee and treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and internal audit.
Market risk a Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is therefore exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to hedge material foreign currency denominated costs at the time of commitment and to hedge a proportion of foreign currency denominated revenues on a rolling 12-month basis.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign denominated cash balances is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Euro denominated interest and principal payments under the 500 million bond have been fully hedged by a cross-currency interest rate swap.
The Groups investments in subsidiaries are not hedged as those currency positions are considered to be long term in nature.
At 31 December 2007, if sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 2 million 2006: 2 million higher lower.
Equity would have been 7 million 2006: 6 million higher lower.
At 31 December 2007, if sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the Euro with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1 million 2006: 1 million higher lower.
Equity would have been 5 million 2006: 1 million higher lower.
b Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk due to its investment in SMG plc.
During 2007 SMGs share price fell 75% to 16 pence 2006: 38% versus the 3% 2006: 9% increase in the FTSE 100.
The investment in SMG Plc is classified as an available for sale financial asset and so any fair value movement initially goes through equity.
However as the share price experienced a significant decline since October 2007 an impairment charge was recognised in the income statement.
This 26 million charge reflected the decline in the share price in the year as an impairment was also recognised in 2006 based on the sustained decrease in share price.
If the share price increased decreased by another 10% in 2007 the impairment charge in 2007 would have been 3 million lower higher.
c Fair value interest risk The Groups principal interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups interest rate policy is to have between 50% and 70% of its total net indebtedness at fixed rates over the medium term in order to provide a balance between certainty of cost and benefit from lower floating rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and options in order to achieve the desired mix between fixed and floating rates.
All of the Groups interest rate swaps are designated as fair value through the profit and loss so any movement in the fair value goes through the income statement rather than equity.
At 31 December 2007, if interest rates had increased decreased by 0.1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1 million 2006: 1 million lower higher.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers, cash and held to maturity investments.
There is also credit risk relating to the Groups own credit rating as it could impact the coupon payable on certain borrowings.
a Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The majority of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers.
Credit insurance has been taken out against these companies to minimise the impact on the Group in the event of a possible default.
b Cash and held to maturity investments The Group operates strict investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash and the emphasis is on preservation of capital.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies.
Deposits longer than three months require the approval of the Management Committee of the Board.
The 100 million UBS note which matures in March 2009 had an Aaa rating from Moodys Investors Service at 31 December 2007.
This is designated as a held to maturity investment in the balance sheet.
c Borrowings The 500 million 2011 and 250 million 2017 bonds issued in October 2006 have coupon step-ups if ITVs credit rating with either Standard & Poors or Moodys Investors Service falls below BBBor Baa3 respectively also known as investment grade.
See note 24 for further details of the coupon rates.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups financing policy is to fund itself for the long term by using debt instruments with a range of maturities.
It is substantially funded from the UK and European capital markets and has bank facilities from the UK syndicated debt market.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn bank facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This monitoring includes financial ratios to assess headroom under financial covenants on bank facilities.
At 31 December 2007 the Group has available 530 million 2006: 450 million of undrawn committed facilities.
Of these 450 million are bank facilities which expire in June 2011.
The remaining 80 million relates to a revolving credit facility provided by UBS secured against the 100 million note.
Both the UBS facility and note mature in March 2009.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

b Fair values Available for sale investments The fair value of available for sale investments traded in active markets is based on quoted market bid prices at the balance sheet date.
Held to maturity investments Held to maturity investments include the 100 million UBS note which was issued in 2007 and is held at amortised cost.
The fair value at 31 December 2007 was 100 million based on quoted market bid prices at the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.
Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at their fair value using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Other assets and liabilities No disclosure of fair value has been made as the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

The Company is exempt from adopting FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Under FRS 29 the Company is exempt from the requirement to provide its own financial instruments disclosures, on the grounds that it is included in publicly available consolidated financial statements which include disclosures that comply with that standard.
However, to be consistent the Company has adopted the same balance sheet captions as the Group in classifying its financial instruments and has restated the 2006 balance sheet accordingly.
The Company has adopted UITF 41 Scope of FRS 20 Share Based Payments for the first time in these accounts.
The adoption of this interpretation represents a change in accounting policy and the 2006 comparative figures have been restated to reflect this.
Prior year adjustment During the year the Company adopted UITF 41 Scope of FRS 20 Share Based Payments.
This interpretation provides guidance on the application of FRS 20 which has resulted in the Company recognising a share based payment in these accounts.
In accordance with UITF 41 this is reflected in the cost of investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The FRS 20 charge, including the amount relating to prior years, was recharged to subsidiary undertakings in the year and reflected as an amount owed by subsidiary undertakings at 31 December 2007.
There is no impact on the profit of the Company in 2007 or 2006.

Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The investment in the Companys subsidiaries is recorded at cost, adjusted for the effect of UITF 41 and recharged share scheme costs.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost.
The difference between cost and redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with movement recorded in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared and approved by the Companys shareholders.

In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
