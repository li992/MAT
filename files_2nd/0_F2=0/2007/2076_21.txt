Changes in the Indicated and Inferred Resources are due to: a the upgrading of Bela Cruz, Teofilo and Cipo areas to Measured Resource category, b new drilling allowing the inclusion of the east half of Monte Branco area, and c the update of the plateaus border and pit limits based on new and more accurate satellite photos.
The exploration program that commenced in 2003, evaluating Inferred Resource within the lease area to convert and increase the Measured and Indicated Resource tonnages, is continuing.
6 Coermotibo The Inferred Resource category resource has increased by 3.2 million dry metric tonnes as a result of exploration in remnant areas within the old open-cut mines.
7 Onverdacht includes the Kaaimangrasie, Klaverblad, Para North, Kankantrie North and Caramacca deposits.
The Lelydorp III mine was closed during the year due to resource and reserve depletion and is therefore no longer included.
The standard cut-off grade COG stands at 15% SiO, except for Para and 2 Kankantrie North, for which a COG of 10% SiO is applied, and Kaaimangrasie for which COGs of 15% SiO, and 30% Fe O are applied.
2 2 2 3 8 The Guinea Alumina Project has recently commenced a Feasibility Study.
Recent drilling and analytical campaigns have not been used in the June 2007 resource estimate.

2 3 6 Worsley Ore Reserve increased approximately 18 million dry metric tonnes as a result of Worsleys ongoing reserve definition drilling campaign.
A classification downgrade from Proved to Probable Ore Reserve category was associated with more rigorous resource classification criteria being implemented.
7 MRN Washed tonnes and grade represent expected product based on forecast beneficiated yield in the reserve area of 77%.
8 MRN The net increase of 90 million dry metric tonnes to the total MRN washed Proved and Probable Reserves in 2007 is due to additional drilling and new resource models built for the Bela Cruz, Teofilo and Cipo areas 106 million dry metric tonnes : this included revised classification criteria less production 16 million dry metric tonnes during FY2007.
9 Onverdacht Difference in Proved Reserves results from 1.8 million dry metric tonnes additional reserves from Caramacca, production depletion and the planned depletion and closure of the Lelydorp III mine.

3 Escondida The Escondida and Escondida Norte mines are adjacent supergene-enriched porphyry copper deposits sharing common processing plants and are thus reported as a single operating unit.
In previous Annual Reports, they were reported as separate deposits.
The most significant factor contributing to the decrease approximately 1.0 billion dry metric tonnes of Inferred Sulphide Leach resources, compared to 2006 reporting, are slightly higher costs and a lower copper price, modified from 2006 to align with BHP Billiton guidelines, used to define the resource pits.
Additional changes are due to the depletion of resources through copper production, updated geological modelling incorporating new data, and variable cut-off grade policy for those resources contained in the reserve mine plan.
Oxide mineralisation continues to be defined on the basis of visual copper oxide mineralisation and a ratio of SCu TCu greater than 0.5.
However, recoverable copper of Oxide mineralisation is now estimated on the basis of TCu, and SCu is no longer carried in the tabulation of Mineral Resources.
4 Cerro Colorado Mineral Resources reported are based on an estimate updated in Nov 2006 for Phases 9 and 10.
Methods of modelling, grade estimation and classification were adjusted relative to previous estimates, in accordance with increased data and reconciliation, although differences in tonnage and grade largely reflect the results of new data rather than estimation parameters.
Significant tonnages of resource were converted from Indicated to Measured category as a result of the in-fill drilling.
An increase in the Inferred Resource is a reflection of recent mine area exploration.
5 Spence The Spence Resource declaration for June 2007 is an update of the June 2006 evaluation and employs essentially the same geological modelling and resource evaluation methodologies.
Additional drilling included a total of 5,000m, and increases the total drilling upon which the 2007 declaration is based to 225,480m.
The only significant change in methodology is that employed for estimation of bulk density, which was changed from assignment of average values to interpolation of individual test data on the basis of a significant increase in available data.
No significant difference in global tonnages resulted from this change.
Processing commenced at Spence in FY2007, and therefore, it is the first year in which the Mineral Resource declaration has included mining depletion.
ROM is run of mine low-grade stockpile.
The Pinto Valley unit resources reflect only changes in stockpile grade through cathode production from the sulphide heap leach operation.
However, to assist in understanding the Ore Reserves rebooked this year based on the approval to restart the mining and milling operation, the resources have been split to separately declare the intact resources from the leach stockpile.
The Miami unit is currently on care and maintenance status, except that the SX-EW unit is processing leach solutions that continue to be cycled through the leachable resources.
Changes to resources reported in 2006 consist of depleting reported grades by recovered cathode copper during FY2007.
7 Olympic Dam The ongoing Olympic Dam drilling program and geological interpretation has provided significantly more information to assist in modelling the resource.
This is the basis for a significant increase 77% tonnage increase and 38% copper metal increase in the Olympic Dam resource base.
The deposit has undergone a major resource modelling change based on the underlying geological controls of Cu-sulphide species, haematite, and structure.
Estimation is now domain based using Ordinary Kriging as the interpolator.
The significant factors contributing to the change in resource tonnage are: a lower cut-off grade to reflect open-cut mining, modelling changes, additional drilling 542 surface and underground drill holes for 240,000m, and higher metal prices.
Non-Sulphide Au only ore type Mineral Resource has been reported separately this year for the first time.
In the resource tabulation, all of the Inferred Resources are based on data interpolation and not extrapolation.
8 Antamina The total resource has increased by approximately 35% in tonnage, with only minor changes in grade, compared to the June 2006 resource report.
The major increase in total resource is due to redefinition of the resource pit limit using the Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resource categories.
The resource pit limit is based on using a Whittle software generated pit limit, followed by the development of a Life of Asset plan.
This pit limit is determined by considering Inferred Resource material within the 2006 resource model as a potential source for processing in the Antamina concentrator.
This resource pit limit is not used for mine planning or reserve reporting purposes.
9 Cannington The resource has increased by 3 million dry metric tonnes due to changes in the cut-off grade based on higher metal prices.

7 At Mt Keith the Ore Reserve has decreased by 49 million tonnes, albeit with a slight increase in nickel grade.
The tonnage reduction is due to mine production during FY2007 11 million dry tonnes, and the results of extensive drilling targeting the base of the MKD5 deposit.
The drilling has resulted in redefinition of the Jons Fault structure.
Reinterpretation of the resource beneath this fault structure has reduced the reserve available from stage I and J of the Mt Keith open-cut mine.

12 Samarco reserves are estimated assuming external supply of approximately 10.2 million wet metric tonnes per annum of process feed from the nearby Fazendao mine, which is owned by CVRD, our 50% Joint Venture partner in Samarco.
The external ore supply has a high proportion of specular hematite, a particular ore type that is required to produce the desired ore blend for producing iron pellets.
The absence of this external ore supply would significantly reduce Samarco Reserves.
The Samarco reserve life has decreased, compared to 2006.
This reflects the increased production rate that will be effective on completion of the current expansion program, that will be completed in FY2008.
New drilling and geological modelling was completed this year and the reserve will be updated with new data next year.

7 Wessels Wessels reserve is quoted as run of mine ROM product tonnage and %Mn W1 lump Wessels main lump manganese product grade on a dry weight per cent basis.
A revised and updated block-model March 2007 was used for the reserve estimation.
Additional surface drill hole data and intensive underground geological mapping enabled an improved structural interpretation.
The surface diamond drill hole spacing decreased from an average of 156 to 142 metres.
The revised interpretation caused the mining blocks, particularly in the Graben area, to be redefined into smaller structural blocks with increased dilution.
The reduction in the reserves by 3 million dry metric tonnes compared to 2006 is due to the revised mining model and production depletion.

10 South Walker Ck 2007 reserves estimated to be 35 million metric tonnes Marketable Coal which is a reduction of 5 million metric tonnes Marketable Coal compared to 2006 reserves before FY2007 production depletion.
Negative change in reserves is mainly attributed to the higher cost assumptions compared to FY2006 -8 million metric tonnes Marketable Coal.
These reductions were off-set by 3 million metric tonnes Marketable Coal for coal recovery improvement.
11 Poitrel started producing in November 2006.
12 Appin Area 3 Extension has been removed from the reserves estimate.
This area was targeted as a likely area for the expansion of the Bulli seam operations.
The project will not go ahead and as there is no intention of applying for approvals in the next five years, or mining the area within the foreseeable future, the reserves have been removed from the declaration.
13 West Cliff The reserve losses are due to to high levels of carbon dioxide CO gas in the northwestern section of the FY2006 layout.
The mine layout has 2 therefore been adjusted to exclude this area of high CO. 2 14 Dendrobium Additional reserves are due to the expectation that approvals from the State Government of New South Wales for a larger area will be secured within five years.
