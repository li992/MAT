These divisions comprise the business segments which form the Groups primary format for segmental reporting.
Secondary information is presented by geographical segment.
NEXT Directory has not previously received a charge for the customer collection and return services provided in store, nor for preparation of Sale stock moved into NEXT Retail.
This year NEXT Retail has charged 14.1m to NEXT Directory.
In order to facilitate comparisons, prior year operating profit has been adjusted by the comparable figure of 9.2m.
There is no change to the total NEXT Brand profit as a consequence.
Significant non-cash items in the Other segment operating profit include share option charges of 8.3m 2006: 8.1m and unrealised foreign exchange losses of 2.0m 2006: gains of 2.1m.
Transactions between business segments are made on an arms length basis in a manner similar to those with third parties.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment operating profit include transactions between business segments: these transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

The recoverable amount of goodwill at 27 January 2007 was measured on the basis of value in use.
As this exceeded carrying value, no impairment loss was recognised.
The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to efficiently meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four 2006: four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 6.5% 2006: 5.25%.
In the year ended January 2007, NEXT Sourcing generated an operating profit before interest of 31.8m 2006: 32.9m.

The defined benefit section is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses ceased to be part of pensionable earnings.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from October 2000.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined from October 2000 and benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
The plan has equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex and complies with the Employment Equality Regulations 2006.
The assets of the plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Group also provides further, unfunded retirement benefits to plan members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the lifetime allowance.
Pension contributions for the Group will continue to be set at a level that takes account of the past service funding position of the plan.
From 1 August 2005 the Group increased employer contributions from 15.5% to 17.5%.
Total employer contributions of 49.4m 2006: 29.6m were made during the year, including 32.5m 2006: 17.5m in respect of the deficit on the defined benefit section and contributions of 1.8m 2006: 1.6m in respect of the defined contribution section.
The Group is committed to making further contributions in respect of the deficit on the defined benefit section totalling 50m over the next four years.
At the year end, outstanding contributions to the defined contribution section included in other creditors were 0.3m 2006: 0.3m.

As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts, loans and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to maximise interest income and minimise interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to manage the mix of fixed and variable rate debt so as to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.

Group policy allows for but does not demand that these exposures may be hedged for up to 18 months ahead in order to fix the cost in sterling, using spot, forward and option contracts.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas assets or liabilities and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
Credit risk Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of overseas sourced products during the next twelve months.
These derivatives comprise forward currency contracts and currency options, the terms of which have been negotiated to match the terms of the expected purchases.
Fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows: 2 20 00 07 7 2006 m m m 1 19 9.. 9 9 Derivatives qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39 2.8 Other foreign exchange derivatives 2 2.. 5 5 0.5 Total foreign exchange derivatives 2 22 2.. 4 4 2.3 Fair value hedges At 27 January 2007, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys 2013 300m 5.25% fixed rate corporate bond.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same critical terms as the bond, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest of 5.25% and pays a combination of a variable rate and a lower fixed rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 21.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are as follows: 2 20 00 07 7 2006 m m m 1 19 9.. 4 4 Derivatives qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39 4.5 Other interest rate derivatives 0 0.. 2 2 Total interest rate derivatives 1 19 9.. 2 2 4.5 The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates, and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
