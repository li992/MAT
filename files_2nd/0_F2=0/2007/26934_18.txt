Accounting policies continued g Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates applicable to the legal jurisdictions in which they arise.
h Investments held at fair value through profit or loss All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Assets are fide-recognised at the trade date of the disposal.
Proceeds will be measured at fair value, which will be regarded as the proceeds of sale less any transaction costs.
The fair value of the financial instruments is based on their quoted bid price at the balance sheet date, without deduction for any of the estimated future selling costs.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors at fair value using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Guidelines.
This includes all non current asset investments held by the Group.
Where fair value cannot reliably be measured the investment will be carried at the previous reporting date value unless there is evidence that the investment has since been impaired, in which case the value will be reduced.
Consolidated changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Also included within this heading are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments.
i Other receivables and other payables Other receivables and other payables do not carry any interest and are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at their nominal value.
j Dividends payable Final dividends are only recognised after they have been approved by shareholders.
Special dividends are recognised when paid to shareholders.
k Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
l Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
m Bank borrowings Bank overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including any premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
