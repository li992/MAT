Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 31 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 7 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based incentive plans for employees.
These comprise an Executive Incentive Plan EIP awarded to the Groups most senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awarded to senior managers employees, a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme that is made available to the majority of employees and a US s423 option scheme that is offered to all permanent employees in the US operating company.
In addition there was a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP operated until 2005, awarding options to senior managers.
The LTIOP and SAYE schemes were in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under all these schemes, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
Executive Incentive Plan EIP The EIP scheme is a one-off conditional award on 1 February 2006 of shares to the 12 most senior executives in the Group to be delivered following the financial year ending 31 March 2009.
The number of shares to be awarded is dependent on the performance of the Group during the year ending 31 March 2009 varying between 0 and 2,700,000.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
Awards over 450,000 of these shares were made for cash settlement.
The fair value of the EIP options was calculated using a Black-Scholes model based on the assumptions below.
EIP 2006 Fair value at grant date 300p Assumptions used Share price 300p Expected volatility 39.7% Expected option life 3.25 years Risk free interest rate 4.4% Volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the shares over a three year period up to the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIOP schemes were awarded to key senior employees at a grant price equal to the Groups share price.
The vesting conditions include a continuation of service, a minimum of three years, and the performance of the Groups shares against a comparator group.
The share price is tested against this group after three years and can be retested after four and five years if the options have not vested.
The proportion of the options vesting is also dependent on the comparative share performance.
The share options can be exercised up to 10 years after the grant date.
Any options remaining unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant will expire.
The fair value of the LTIOP and LTIP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.
In June 2006 a new Executive Plan the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP conditional award of shares was made.
The vesting conditions are based on performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 over the three year life of the scheme.
At the vesting date the share award will either vest or lapse.
The fair value was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.

Save as You Earn SAYE schemes The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
They provide an option price equal to the daily average market price at the date of the offer less 20%.
The French scheme may be offered at a different rate to ensure compliance with French regulations.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for the three or five year period and the maintenance of the employees regular monthly savings in an account.
Failure of either of these conditions is deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.
There have been 16 SAYE grants since 7 November 2002.
Four were awarded on 4 July 2006, four were awarded on 24 June 2005, four were awarded on 30 June 2004 and a further four on 30 June 2003.

The options are granted to those who elect to participate and the scheme has a savings element similar to the SAYE scheme.
At the end of one year up to 20% of the options can be exercised with the remainder exercisable after two years.
The option price is the lesser of 85% of the market value of the shares on the date of grant and the date of exercise.
The fair value of the options was calculated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes model and the assumptions used are shown below.

Those calculations use cash ow projections based on actual operating results and management projections for a further six years.
Cash ows for further periods are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% 2006: 2% which is appropriate for the long-term nature of the business.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2006: 9% has been used in discounting the projected cash ows.
A period of more than five years has been used as the directors believe this is a reasonable assumption based on the fact that the investments are all held for the long term.
For periods after five years, extrapolations have been applied from the earlier budgets and forecasts, after assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions by examining the causes of differences between past cash ow projections and actual cash ows.
The key assumption used is the sales growth rate.
This is based upon historical growth rates and future plans in the medium term.
Long-term growth rates are based upon expected GDP growth, in line with IFRS 36: Impairment of Assets, rather than management expectations.
The recoverable amount of the unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
All financial instruments are accounted for on trade date.
Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis.
Trading receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience and assessment of their current economic environment.
The average credit period taken by customers is 54 days 2006: 54 days.
The investment management of liquid funds aims to maximise the return on net funds subject to the security of the principal and the liquidity of the Group.
The Group identies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.
The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at xed rates of interest and also the interest cash ow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates, where appropriate interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups principal interest rate risk policy.
The Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
Multi-currency cash pooling is in place with our banks across the Group to ensure daily netting of almost all the Groups cash ows in all currencies with consequent improvements to liquidity and interest costs.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
Two interest rate swaps have been entered into in order to achieve this policy.
The swaps mature over the next five years following the maturity of the related loans, one of which is amortising, and have xed swap rates of 1.15% and 3.85%.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had interest rate swaps with notional contract amounts of JPY 800m and EUR 4.5m 2006: JPY 800m and EUR 5.4m.
The Group classies these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of swaps at 31 March 2007 was nil, comprising assets of nil and liabilities of nil 2006: nil.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.

Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
All financial instruments are at oating rates of interest except for finance lease liabilities.

Excluding the $100m bilateral, as at 31 March 2007, the Group had available 113.5m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk primarily because purchases in currencies other than Sterling are much less than its receivables in those currencies.
A very high level of hedging of currency exposures over catalogue lives is implemented in order to shelter forecast gross profits.
In this way the impacts of currency uctuations are smoothed until selling or cost prices can be changed in light of the movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury on the basis of trading projections provided by local businesses.
Specic cash ows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
The Group classies forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash ow hedges.
These forecast cash ows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 16 months from the year end, and will affect the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts as at 1 April 2006 was -0.1m comprising assets of 0.9m and liabilities of -1.0m and was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2007 was 0.9m, comprising assets of 2.0m and liabilities of -1.1m.
Of this the amount expected to be recognised in more than one year was nil.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2007 was nil.
The total net amount recognised in equity in the year to 31 March 2007 was 1.0m and the total net amount removed from equity during the year and taken to the income statement was -0.4m.
Foreign currency translation exposures arising from where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of Sterling are not explicitly hedged, local currency debt is used where economic and scally efficient in the nancing of subsidiaries and this provides a partial hedge.
Guidelines are in place for reviewing the impact of translation exposures arising from both the currency mix of the Groups net debt and of net assets should there be any material changes.
The Group has designated certain external loans as hedges of its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the US hedge was US $170m 87m, of which $100m 51m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and $70m 36m was in the form of an overdraft.
The carrying amount of the Euro hedge was 65m 44m, of which 55m 37m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and 10m 7m was in the form of an overdraft.
Both the US Dollar and Euro overdrafts were shown in the balance sheet netted with positive cash balances, as there is an absolute right of set-off.
A foreign exchange gain of 12m was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to sterling.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risk the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term uctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on Group earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.5m.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of the US Dollar and the Euro against Sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by 0.4m for the year ended 31 March 2007.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward rate.
For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash ows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year the notional amount is deemed to reect the fair value.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash ows discounted at market rates.
Trade and other receivables and payables Receivables and payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
The average credit period taken for trade payables is 43 days 2006: 43 days.
22 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Group m m m m m m Property, plant & equipment 0.1 1.8 13.5 15.9 13.4 14.1 Goodwill 18.3 15.8 18.3 15.8 Retirement benefit obligations 9.6 12.1 9.6 12.1 Inventories 0.4 0.8 0.1 0.3 0.8 Employee benefits 1.5 1.0 1.5 1.0 Provisions 1.0 0.7 1.0 0.7 Other items 0.3 0.8 1.2 0.5 1.2 Tax losses 11.1 13.7 11.1 13.7 Tax assets liabilities 24.0 30.1 32.7 32.9 8.7 2.8 Set off of tax 9.8 12.6 9.8 12.6 Net tax assets liabilities 14.2 17.5 22.9 20.3 8.7 2.8 A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2007 2006 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 8.5 11.0 8.5 11.0 The tax losses above have not been recognised as recoverability is uncertain.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was expected to be 6.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Further, the Group has sufficient relevant losses to fully offset the 6.0 million liability.
Deferred tax has been measured using the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK at the balance sheet date.
In April 2008 the statutory rate of corporation tax will be reduced to 28%.
Based on the statutory rate of 28% the net deferred tax liability at 31 March 2007 would have been 0.1m lower.
