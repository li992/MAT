This profit on disposal has been recognised as other income in the Group income statement.
Consequently, the Bank became a 50:50 joint venture between the Company and HBOS plc.
The results of the Bank have been fully consolidated into the Group results until 8 February 2007, with a corresponding minority interest shown for the minority share of these results.
Following the sale on 8 February 2007, the Bank is treated as a joint venture and equity accounted in the Group financial statements.
At 24 March 2007, the assets and liabilities of the Bank have not been consolidated in the Group balance sheet but instead a joint venture investment of 88 million representing the Groups 50 per cent share of the Banks net assets at that date note 14 has been included.
The Group has accounted for its equity share of the results of the Bank for the period from 8 February 2007 to 24 March 2007.
Past service gains on defined benefit schemes Following changes introduced by the Finance Act effective from 6 April 2006, the defined benefit schemes have implemented revised terms to provide members with the option to surrender a greater proportion of their pension for a tax-free cash lump sum payment.
Accordingly, the Group revised its assumptions used in calculating the retirement benefit obligations in respect of this and certain minor changes in scheme rules and has recognised 72 million of past service gains in the Group income statement.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any gain or loss on the sale of properties, impairment of goodwill, financing fair value movements and one-off items that are material and infrequent in nature.
This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Groups underlying trading performance.

Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations is managed through the use of interest rate swaps and options.
The Groups objectives are to match the interest rate profiles of its borrowings to that of its revenues, to minimise interest expense and reduce rate volatility by holding an appropriate mix of borrowings at fixed, floating and inflation-linked rates of interest.
Group policy provides that the relative proportion of fixed, floating and inflation-linked borrowings may be varied within defined bands around neutral benchmarks.
Currency risk The Group incurs currency exposure in respect of overseas trade purchases made in currencies other than sterling.
The Group uses a programme of rolling forward contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated with these purchases, which may be either contracted or not contracted.
Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in equity when the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Liquidity risk The Groups exposure to liquidity risk is managed by pre-funding cash flow requirements and maturing debt obligations, maintaining a diversity of funding sources and spreading debt repayments over a range of maturities.
The Groups core funding takes the form of term loans secured over property assets.

31 Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefit obligations relate to two funded defined benefit schemes, the J Sainsbury Pension and Death Benefit Scheme JSPDBS and the J Sainsbury Executive Pension Scheme JSEPS and an unfunded pension liability relating to senior employees.
The defined benefit schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The defined benefit schemes were subject to a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, at March 2006 on the projected unit basis.
The results of this valuation are expected to be approved by the schemes trustees in June 2007.
The retirement benefit obligations at 24 March 2007 has been calculated, where appropriate, on a basis consistent with this draft valuation.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
As part of the 350 million one-off contribution to the defined benefit schemes, the Group made the second tranche payment of 240 million on 19 May 2006 2006: 110 million paid on 24 March 2006.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Present value of funded obligations 4,395 4,361 Fair value of plan assets 4,298 3,710 97 651 Present value of unfunded obligations 6 7 Retirement benefit obligations 103 658 Deferred income tax asset 48 227 Net retirement benefit obligations 55 431 The retirement benefit obligations and the associated deferred income tax asset are shown within different line items on the face of the balance sheet.

The combined life expectancy for both the schemes operated at the balance sheet date for a pensioner at normal retirement age is as follows: 2007 2006 years years Male pensioner 21.4 19.3 Female pensioner 22.9 21.7 In line with the schemes experience and the generally observed trend amongst the population, a greater allowance for future longevity has been adopted in respect of the current mortality of pensioners.
The effect of this change is to assume that a typical pensioner will live a further 0.9 years from normal retirement age.
This allowance has had the impact of increasing the retirement benefit obligations by 196 million compared to using the previous mortality assumptions.
The profile of members and the salary and pension increase assumptions have been updated from the last triennial valuation.
The impact of these changes is to reduce the retirement benefit obligations by 59 million.
Movements in financial assumptions have resulted in a reduction in retirement benefit obligations of 108 million with a further actuarial gain on plan assets of 89 million.
Based on past experience, the Group has made the assumption that 80 per cent of the schemes members will elect to surrender one quarter of their pension for a cash lump sum payment.
The impact of this commutation assumption is to reduce the retirement benefit obligations by 119 million.
These items have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense.
In addition, following changes introduced by the Finance Act effective from 6 April 2006, the defined benefit schemes have implemented revised terms to provide members with the option to surrender a greater proportion of their pension for a tax-free cash lump sum payment.
The impact of this change and other minor changes to scheme rules has been to reduce retirement benefit obligations by 72 million.
This change has resulted in past service gains of 72 million being recognised in the income statement note 7.

The Group operates various share-based payment schemes as set out below: a Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The Group operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months continuous service.
This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980.
Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
At 24 March 2007, UK employees held 21,833 five-year savings contracts 2006: 24,033 in respect of options over 20.5 million shares 2006: 21.6 million and 24,919 three-year savings contracts 2006: 23,265 in respect of options over 14.1 million shares 2006: 13.8 million.

b Colleague Share Option Plan CSOP The Colleague Share Option Plan operates under the rules of the HMRC Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Under the CSOP, participants are granted options to purchase shares of the Company at a stated exercise price.
The exercise of options is conditional upon participants remaining in the employment of the Group for a three-year period after date of grant.
Colleagues leaving employment for certain reasons have six months from their leaving date to exercise their options.
At 24 March 2007, a total of 17,793 UK employees 2006: 54,817 participated in the plan and held options over 5.7 million shares 2006: 18.6 million.
Options have been exercised in respect of 7.9 million 2006: 32,058 ordinary shares during the year.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of the grant of option.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.

The maximum annual option award was two times basic salary and the grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS relative to inflation over a three-year period.
EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year in which the option was granted.
To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested on a fixed point basis over four and then five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between vesting date normally at the end of the three-year performance period and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.

Under the PSP, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to receive a grant of options after a performance period of three years to acquire the shares awarded to them, at any time during the ten years following the date of grant.
The participants entitlement to receive the grant depends on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR being the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, compared with a peer group of 12 companies namely Ahold, Alliance Boots, Carrefour, Casino, DSG International, GUS, Kingfisher, Loblaw, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Next and Tesco, over the three-year performance period.
If the median performance of the TSR against the comparator group is not achieved at the end of the three-year performance period, the entitlement to receive the grant of options will lapse.
At median level, shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released and the award will be pro rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The maximum allocation for Directors is a conditional grant of shares equal to 75 per cent of salary.
No further allocations will be made under this plan.

The free shares are being held in a trust on behalf of participants and will be forfeited if participants cease to remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years.
Shares are released to participants within the first three years for certain reasons.
After the three-year period, the shares continue to be held by the trust for a further holding period of two years, unless they are released to participants upon cessation of employment with the Group.
A reconciliation of shares held in the trust is shown below: Number of shares 2007 2006 million million Outstanding at beginning of year 1.7 1.9 Forfeited 0.1 0.2 Released to participants 0.1 Outstanding at end of year 1.5 1.7 84 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Share-based payments continued f J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005 Under the J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005, shares were awarded to participants on the conditional basis that the performance targets are achieved within the four-year performance period, from the financial year beginning 27 March 2005 until the financial year ending March 2009.
The levels of awards are scaled according to seniority and there is an opportunity for Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members to make a personal investment of up to 50 per cent of salary in the plan.
The awards will vest if stretching sales and earnings per share EPS targets are achieved, as shown in table 1 below.
The relevant performance multiplier, which is on a sliding scale up to a maximum of five times, will be calculated and applied to the core award of shares, as well as the personal investment of shares i. e. shares acquired by Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members.
Further, there is an opportunity for partial vesting of up to half the award, if the accelerated performance targets have been met at the end of year three i. e. financial year ending March 2008 as shown in table 2.
No awards will vest unless threshold levels of growth in both sales and EPS are achieved.
Once performance targets have been achieved, options will be granted to participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons to acquire the shares awarded to them, at nil cost.
The options will expire within a year after the end of the four-year performance period.
Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.
In order to participate in the plan, participants agreed to surrender options granted to them under the Companys Executive Share Option Plan in 2002, 2003 and 2004.

g Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006, shares were conditionally awarded to the top 1,000 managers in the Company, from the Chief Executive to the supermarket store managers.
The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grades.
The awards will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions Return on Capital Employed ROCE and growth in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period.
As set out in table 3 below, the core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.
Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period.
If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released.
Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will be released on the fourth anniversary of the date of award.
Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from vesting date.

37 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments Contingent liabilities Operating lease commitments note 35 include payments in respect of 26 supermarket properties sold 16 supermarket properties sold in March 2000 for 325 million and ten supermarket properties sold in July 2000 for 226 million and leased back to Sainsburys Supermarkets for a period of 23 years.
Under the arrangement, the Company has provided a residual value guarantee of 170 million for the 16 supermarket properties and 39 million for the ten supermarket properties at the end of the lease period.

Financial commitments The financial commitments of Sainsburys Bank plc, a 50 per cent joint venture of the Group, are set out below.
Sainsburys Bank The amounts noted below indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect of undrawn commitments to lend on credit cards, mortgages and personal loans.
