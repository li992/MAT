Directors Responsibility Statement The Directors are responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year and which are in accordance with applicable laws.
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Guernsey Law 1994.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
