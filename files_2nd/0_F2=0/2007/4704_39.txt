22 Financial instruments and risk management Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and policies are disclosed in the Business review see Risk management.
i Currency risk management The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, the groups policy, where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, was to hedge currency exposure on its net foreign operations before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages: 90% US dollars, 90% euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net foreign operations before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
The effective portion of exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency swaps and forwards is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement in accordance with IAS 39.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all net investment hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
Transaction exposure hedging For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is effective and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
