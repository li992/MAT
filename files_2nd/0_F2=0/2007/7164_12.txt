Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty i Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the Group has recognised a pension deficit of 43.5 million 2006 55.9 million.
The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to gains on assets in the period.
Changes in the benefit obligations as a result of changes in discount rate and inflation assumptions have had less of an impact.
The main assumptions are set out in note 19 of the financial statements.
ii Goodwill impairment Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
In performing these tests, assumptions are made in respect of future growth rates and the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows of income generating units.
These assumptions are set out in note 12 of the financial statements.
iii Provisions in respect of disposed businesses As described in note 20, provisions in respect of disposed businesses have been made.
In assessing the adequacy of these provisions, estimates are made of probable cash outflows in the future.

Goodwill In s million 2007 2006 Cost At 1 July 126.2 99.4 Exchange adjustments 2.1 1.2 Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings note 28 41.5 25.6 Amounts written back in year 7.9 At 30 June 157.7 126.2 Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of that income-generating unit.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of value in use calculations and its fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on internal business plans approved by the Directors.
Following the above impairment tests, no impairment of goodwill was required in the year or the preceding year.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: In s million 2007 2006 United Kingdom & Ireland 92.8 67.6 Continental Europe & Rest of World 49.6 51.0 Asia Pacific 15.6 7.6 158.0 126.2 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on an average estimated growth rate of 3.0%.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.5% post tax.

Trade receivables are stated net of an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts of 12.1 million 2006 10.9 million.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

Retirement benefit obligations Within the UK, the Group operates a defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
UK defined contribution scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 15% of pensionable salary depending on the length of pensionable service and seniority.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 0.8 million 2006 0.4 million represents contributions payable to the Stakeholder Plan.
Contributions of nil 2006 nil were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
UK defined benefit schemes i The main scheme, the Hays Pension Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001.
It is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuations were performed at 30 June 2004.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme to 30 June 2007 has been performed by the Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2007 are listed on following page.
Retirement benefit obligations continued IAS 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the Balance Sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The key assumptions are as follows: 2007 2006 Inflation assumption 3.30% 2.90% Discount rate 5.57% 5.22% Rate of increase in salaries 5.80% 5.40% Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.30% 2.90% Expected long term rates of return on scheme assets 6.87% 6.53% The assumption for the expected long term returns for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The long term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income charge.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the PA92 generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection.
This assumes that a 65 year old, male, current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.9 years.
The amounts recognised in the consolidated Income Statement for the defined benefit schemes are as follows: In s million 2007 2006 Current service cost 7.1 8.1 Past service costs 0.1 Total operating charge 7.1 8.2 Expected return on pension scheme assets 24.4 21.2 Interest on pension liabilities 22.5 20.1 Net financial income 1.9 1.1 Total amount charged to the consolidated Income Statement 5.2 7.1 The actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense as follows: In s million 2007 2006 Actuarial gain on scheme assets 16.0 19.1 Actuarial losses on scheme liabilities 4.7 4.7 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 1.6 1.4 Net income recognised directly in consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense 12.9 15.8 In s million 2007 2006 Deficit in the scheme brought forward 55.9 69.7 Current service cost 7.1 8.1 Past service costs 0.1 Contributions 4.7 5.1 Net financial return 1.9 1.1 Actuarial gain 12.9 15.8 Deficit in the scheme carried forward 43.5 55.9 Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19.

The expected rates of return for corporate bonds have been based on market yields at the Balance Sheet date, with equity returns assumed to be 3.0% per annum above gilt returns.

It is not possible to estimate the timing of payments against the other deferred employee benefit provisions.
Other provisions comprise liabilities arising as a result of the business disposals and the Group transformation that concluded in 2004, including the following items: Provisions of 3.7 million 2006 7.1 million relating to restructuring costs arising from the Group transformation.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next 24 months.
Provisions of 6.0 million 2006 6.2 million for potential liabilities relating to the disposal of the chemicals business including certain site restitution costs.
Provisions of 18.9 million 2006 19.1 million relating to possible warranty and environmental claims in relation to businesses disposed of.

The impact of the rate change is reflected in the current year movement.
Profitable trading conditions in France have led to a deferred tax asset of 2.0 million being recognised in the year in respect of accumulated losses brought forward.
At the Balance Sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 21.3 million 2006 15.9 million available for offset against future profits of which 10.0 million relates to UK capital losses and 11.3 million to overseas losses.
No material deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses 2006 nil.
These are unrecognised tax losses that are unlikely to expire in the short term.
0.1 million is due to expire in 2012.
The Group has unused tax credits of 0.6 million 2006 nil available against future profits: these credits are unlikely to expire in the short term.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these credits 2006 nil.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not been provided is 84.0 million.
The reason for not providing is because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
Additionally it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future and the level of underlying tax credit on remitted earnings is likely to cover any UK corporation tax.

Long Term Co-Incentive Plan LTCIP In previous years, employees were invited to commit a number of shares to the LTCIP.
The LTCIP is based upon the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the Company over a three year period, compared to a peer group of 15 other companies including Hays plc.
Dependent upon the performance ranking, the Company will match up to five times the number of shares committed by the employee.
If the ranking of Hays plc is ninth or less then there is no matching of shares by the Company.
During the year, there were no invitations 2006 2.4 million invitations to the LTCIP.
The fair value of these invitations in the previous year was 4.8 million.
The fair value of invitations is calculated at the final date of commitment and is charged to the Income Statement over the vesting period of three years.
The 2003 LTCIP award vested in December 2006 and participants became entitled to one matching share based on the Companys TSR performance over the three year period to 10 December 2006, where Hays was ranked in seventh position out of the peer group of 15 companies.
A total of 1.7 million shares were matched for this award.
Share-based payments continued Revised Long Term Incentive arrangements As noted on page 31 of the Remuneration Report, new Long Term Incentive arrangements have been implemented in the year.
These are the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and the Performance Share Plan PSP, both of which are equity settled share-based payment awards with non-market performance conditions over a three-year period.
Under the DAB, up to 100% of the annual bonus is deferred into Hays shares and is matched with free conditional shares or nil cost options on a one for one basis, dependent on the performance conditions over a three-year period.
Under the PSP, awards will not exceed two times a participants base salary in any financial year.
The performance criteria for the DAB awards made in the year are a combination of cumulative Group EPS and cumulative International Net Fees.
The performance criteria for the PSP awards made in the year are a combination of cumulative Group EPS, cumulative Economic Profit and cumulative Regional Operating Profit.
The performance period for the DAB and PSP awards is the three years from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009.
During the year, 3.5 million 2006 nil was charged to the Income Statement for the cost of these schemes.
Also during the year, 6.7 million shares 2006 nil were transferred from the Companys holding in treasury shares, to an employee benefit trust to satisfy the maximum award payable under the PSP scheme.
Acquisitions and disposals The Group made one acquisition during the year 2006 two acquisitions were made.
Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations management has a period of 12 months from acquisition to finalise their calculations of fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses.
The details of the acquisition made are as follows: On 23 February 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of James Harvard International Group Limited, James Harvard International Asia KK and their subsidiaries for a consideration of 44.5 million.
James Harvard is a recruitment business specialising in the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology sectors and IT Financial Services sector.

The business contributed 14.3 million turnover, 4.7 million net fees and 1.2 million profit to the Group results before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisition of James Harvard International Group Limited, James Harvard International Asia KK and their subsidiaries had been completed on 1 July 2006, the Group turnover would have increased by 23.8 million, net fees would have increased by 7.7 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have increased by 1.4 million.
