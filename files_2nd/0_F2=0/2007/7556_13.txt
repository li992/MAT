indd 48 31 3 08 13:45:20 Galiform plc Annual Report 2007 b Exceptional tax credit 2007 This is explained at note 18. c Discontinued operations 2007 A change to the law regarding business rates on vacant properties has been substantially enacted during the period.
Prior to the change, there were no business rates to pay for the first three months that a property was empty, and then there was a business rates exemption of 50% for retail properties and 100% for warehouses.
Following the change, there is still an exemption for the first three months, and six months for industrial and warehouse properties, but after that time companies now have to pay business rates at 100% for all properties.
The amount provided in this period relates primarily to business rates on properties which were part of the Groups former MFI Retail operations, which were discontinued in 2006.
On the disposal of the MFI Retail operations, the continuing Group remained the ultimate guarantor for these properties and made such provision for rent payable in empty periods as was considered necessary at the time.
That provision was included in the 31.7m item Exceptional provisions on disposal of MFI Retail Limited included in the 2006 accounts and shown in the 2006 comparative figures below.
Of the total 7.1m charged in the period, 5.6m relates to business rates, while the balance relates to other related property expenses.
Discontinued exceptional items also include a 4.0m charge in relation to professional fees.
There is an associated tax credit of 2.1m in respect of discontinued exceptional items.
Exceptional items charged to the income statement in the 53 weeks to 30 December 2006 are analysed as follows: Other Selling and Cost of operating Administration distribution sales income expenses costs Total Note m m m m m Continuing operations: Restructuring 6 d 30.2 30.2 Factory closures 6 e 6.8 17.0 12.7 36.5 Retirement benefit exceptional gain 6 f 38.0 38.0 Exceptional stock provision 6 g 6.0 6.0 Other profit loss on disposal 6 h 2.5 2.5 Total charged to operating profit 12.8 14.5 7.8 12.7 32.2 Tax credit on exceptional items in continuing operations 2.0 Net exceptional items in continuing operations 30.2 Discontinued operations: Restructuring 0.2 Factory closures 9.4 Profit on disposal of Hygena Cuisines 62.5 Loss on disposal of MFI UK Retail 155.7 Exceptional provisions on disposal of MFI UK Retail 31.7 Profit on disposal of Sofa Workshop Limited 0.2 Other loss on disposal 0.9 Total discontinuing exceptional items before tax 134.8 Tax charge on exceptional items in discontinued operations 2.3 Net exceptional items in discontinued operations 137.1 Total exceptional items before tax 167.0 Total tax on exceptional items 0.3 Total exceptional items net of tax 167.3 49 GA2227 - AR07 back AW02.

Between the start of the 2006 period and the disposal of the UK Retail business, Retail had ceased trading in 13 locations and 3 regional home delivery centres had closed.
In the same statement, the Group announced its intention to reorganise the Group into three distinct trading businesses.
This process was completed before the disposal of the UK Retail business.
The costs of restructuring comprise the following items: m m UK Retail restructuring: redundancies 3.8 other restructuring costs 2.2 profit on disposal of properties 6.2 0.2 Group restructuring: business separation 18.8 redundancy costs 5.4 property costs 2.9 refinancing costs 3.1 30.2 Total restructuring costs before tax 30.0 Tax credit on restructuring costs 10.0 Total restructuring costs after tax 20.0 The restructuring costs before tax are allocated between continuing and discontinued operations as follows: m Continuing operations 30.2 Discontinued operations 0.2 30.0 GA2227 - AR07 back AW02.

These factories formed part of continuing operations.
The closures were completed before the end of the 2006 period.
It was mentioned in the 2006 Interim Report that a closure programme was in place at the Groups sofa manufacturing facility at Llantrisant.
This operation formed part of discontinued operations.
The closure was completed before the end of the 2006 period.
The costs of closure comprise the following items: m Redundancy costs 11.4 Inventory write-offs 9.1 Loss on disposal of assets 20.3 Provisions 2.2 Other costs of exit 2.9 Total factory closure costs before tax 45.9 Tax credit on factory closure costs 7.0 Total factory closure costs after tax 38.9 The closure costs before tax are allocated between continuing and discontinued operations as follows: m Continuing operations 36.5 Discontinued operations 9.4 45.9 The tax credit associated with the exceptional costs is lower than 30% as: i. some costs are not tax deductible ii.
no deferred tax assets have been recognised on the write-down of factories within MFI UK Limited f Retirement benefit exceptional gain 2006 During the 2006 period, the Groups defined benefit retirement benefit plan was altered so that the benefits payable were changed from a final salary basis to a career average revalued earnings basis.
"This change gave rise to a reduction in the past service liability in respect of active members, which has been treated as an exceptional gain during the period, as set out in IAS 19 ""Employee Benefits""."
The amount of the exceptional gain was 38.0m, and it all relates to continuing operations.
There is related deferred tax of 11.4m.
Further details of the gain are given in note 23. g Exceptional stock provision 2006 This relates to continuing operations in the Supply business.
Further developments in 2007 meant that 1.5m of this provision became surplus to requirements.

On 26 June 2007 the House of Commons approved the Finance Bill which reduces the UK standard rate of Corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
This reduction in rate results in a decreased deferred tax charge of 1.8m in the current year charge.
As the financial condition of the Group has improved significantly over the period, the Group has recognised 23.9m of deferred tax assets in certain of its subsidiaries.
The relevant subsidiaries were loss making in 2006 and therefore no deferred tax asset was booked on the balance sheet.
Given the size and one-off nature, this deferred tax credit has been treated as an exceptional item.

The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables of 10.0m 2006: 12.0m.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other assets is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This scheme began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 0.6m 2006: 0.2m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plans The Group operates two funded pension schemes which provide benefits based on the pensionable pay of participating employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined separately for each scheme by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial valuation was carried out at 6 April 2005 by the scheme actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward this valuation to 29 December 2007 and restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
The UK Retail arm of the Groups operations was sold in 2006 see note 12 for further details of the sale.
The sale took place after the benefits of the Plan were changed from a final salary to a career average revalued earnings basis.
Benefits earned prior to the change now revalue in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% p. a. instead of in line with salary growth.
This, therefore, reduced the past service liability in respect of the active members.
The UK Retail employees became deferred members of the Plan after the benefit changes occurred and the sale did not, therefore, affect the past service liability.
The pensionable salary roll in the Plan, and hence the ongoing cost of future accruals, both reduced as a result of the sale.

indd 68 26 3 08 10:34:19 Galiform plc Annual Report 2007 Key assumptions used in the valuation of the schemes 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 29 December 2007 30 December 2006 Rate of increase of pensions in payment: pensions with guaranteed increases i. e. most of the pre-1997 pensions 3.00% 3.00% pensions with increases capped at the lower of LPI and 5% 3.50% 2.90% pensions with increases capped at the lower of LPI and 2.5% 2.50% 2.50% Rate of increase in salaries 4.50% 4.00% Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.00% Expected return on scheme assets weighted average 7.39% 7.06% Discount rate 5.90% 5.10% The following mortality tables were used in both years: Mortality before retirement: Males AM92 Females AF92 Mortality in retirement Males PMA92 short cohort, Females PFA92 short cohort, i. e. current pensioners : projected to 2015 projected to 2015 Mortality in retirement Males PMA92 short cohort, Females PFA92 short cohort, i. e. pensions not yet in payment : projected to 2025 projected to 2025 The mortality assumption adopted by the Group is equivalent to the following life expectancies from age 65 : Male yrs Female yrs Non-pensioner 21.6 24.4 Pensioner 20.9 23.7 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions If there was an increase decrease in the net discount rate i. e. the difference between the discount rate and the assumed rates of increase in salaries, deferred pension revaluation or pensions in payment of 0.1%, there would be a corresponding decrease increase in the scheme liabilities of around 2.6%, or 16.0m, and a decrease increase in the current service cost of around 3% or 0.2m.
The effect of changing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 3% or 18.0m, and to increase the assessed value of the current service cost by around 3% or 0.2m.

A single long-term assumption is then calculated as the weighted average of the actual asset allocation and the long-term assumption for each asset class.

Contingent liabilities a Relating to the disposal of the UK Retail operations As disclosed at the time of the transactions with MEP Mayflower Limited MEP, the Group was the guarantor on leases in relation to 56 properties which were held by MFI Properties Limited MFI Properties and occupied by the MFI UK Retail operations Retail with rentals being paid by Retail to MFI Properties.
By 29 December 2007, this number had reduced to 50 properties.
The Groups guarantees are triggered if MFI Properties Limited defaults on its obligations under the relevant leases for example because it suffers financial distress.
However, under the terms of the sale of Retail to MEP, MEP have given the Group an indemnity for any costs incurred by the Group in relation to any non-payment by MFI Properties Limited.
The current annual net rentals in respect of these remaining properties total 16.2m, with associated business rates of 7.1m.
Remaining lease terms range between 9 months and 17.9 years from 29 December 2007, with the average lease term being 8.75 years from 29 December 2007.
The Group is not aware that the purchaser or its subsidiaries is in financial distress.
There is uncertainty whether the purchaser or its subsidiaries will ever suffer financial distress and thereby trigger the guarantee, and as to the actual net liability if the Group ever did have to meet the lease obligations, given that the Group would seek to mitigate any liabilities by surrendering or assigning the leases, or by subletting them to third parties.
Because of the nature of the uncertainties, as described above, the Group is unable to give an estimate of the financial effect of this contingent liability.
The Group is also exposed to potential costs in respect of certain warranties and indemnities given by Galiform plc Galiform in favour of MEP in the sale and purchase agreement the SPA relating to the sale of Retail.
One of the warranties given by Galiform relates to the net value of some of the assets and liabilities of MFI on the effective date of the sale 5 August 2006.
Over the course of 2007, MEP has made a number of notifications to Galiform alleging breach of this warranty.
Each notification has been thoroughly investigated by external forensic accountants engaged by the Group.
indd 76 26 3 08 10:34:21 Galiform plc Annual Report 2007 The Group has strongly rejected MEPs allegations and MEP recently began legal proceedings against Galiform formally claiming breach of the warranty.
Having taken extensive advice from external lawyers and forensic accountants, the Board of Galiform considers that the majority of MEPs total claim is without merit, and MEP has chosen, incorrectly, to ignore a substantial number of offsetting items.
To date, MEPs total gross claim amounts to approximately 57m.
However, in light of the advice it has received, the Board is confident of the strength of its case and is firmly of the view that only a small fraction of this amount if any will ultimately be payable.
The Group has made such provision as is considered necessary for the claim.
Because of the uncertainties as to how this matter will progress, the Group is currently unable to give any details as to the expected timing of any resulting payments to MEP, if any.
Under the SPA, MEP may make claims against Galiform for breach of non-tax warranties in the SPA until 18 October 2008 and for breach of tax warranties or any claim under the tax covenant until the sixth anniversary of the end of the accounting period of Retail in which completion of the sale of Retail occurred.
The aggregate liability of Galiform in respect of the warranties that Galiform has given in the SPA and in respect of the tax covenant is capped at 49.6 million other than in the case of fraud or in the case any claims under the warranties relating to title, capacity and authority or claims for secondary tax liabilities, for which, in each case, Galiforms liability is uncapped.
In addition, under the SPA, Galiform agreed to indemnify MEP in respect of certain potential liabilities in relation to pensions, employee transfers, tax, property, and part of the pre-sale reorganisation relating to Retail.
Under IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets, there is an obligation to disclose information about the amount of any provision made.
However, IAS 37 allows a company to omit this disclosure in cases where disclosure would be expected to seriously prejudice the position of the company in a dispute with other parties on the subject matter of the provision or contingent liability, The Group considers that the provision made by the Group in respect of the claim brought by MEP for breach of the warranty referred to above falls within this expectation, and therefore we are restricting our disclosure accordingly.
b Other guarantees The Group has guaranteed a US$10.0m 2006: US$10.0m letter of credit facility from Standard Chartered Bank in favour of Howden Kitchens Asia Limiteds suppliers.
This contingency would only trigger in the event that Howden Kitchens Asia Limited fails to honour its obligations under the terms of the facility.
Members of the Group have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business.
Should the assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the Group will be liable for those defaults.
The number of claims arising to date has been small and the cost, which is charged to income as it arises, has not been material.

Share-based payments 1 Details of each scheme The Group recognised a charge of 5.7m 2006: charge of 3.8m in respect of share-based payments during the period.
The Group has various share-based payment schemes, which are all equity-settled.
The main details of all schemes which existed during the period are given below.
a Performance Share Plan This is a discretionary free share plan.
In the majority of awards, participants have a contingent right to receive free shares with performance conditions attached, based on the companys EPS.
The performance period is measured from the start of the financial period in which the awards are granted.
The performance period is three years.
Vesting occurs at the end of the performance period.
The different subdivisions and performance conditions are as follows: i.
Performance is measured relative to a Comparator Group of 12-14 companies.
40% of the award vests if Total Shareholder Return TSR is at median level compared to the Comparator Group over the performance period, subject to a condition that EPS must also grow by at least 9%.
100% of the award vests if TSR is at upper quartile level and the EPS growth condition is also satisfied.
The award vests on a straight-line basis between these maximum and minimum points.
No other condition other than continued employment.
50% of the Options shall be exercisable if the compound annual growth in the Groups Operating Profit over the performance period is at least 10% rising to 100% if compound annual growth over the same period is at least 20%.
25% of the award will vest if 2010 PBT of 110m is achieved.
100% will vest if 2010 PBT of 135m is achieved.
The awards will vest on a sliding scale between these two points.
b Deferred Bonus Plan Participants defer their cash bonus into shares for a period of three years.
Participants have no entitlement to dividends during the deferral period.
There are no performance conditions attached.
The shares vest at the end of the three year holding period.
c Senior Management Co-investment Plan This is a co-investment plan whereby employees can defer their cash bonus into shares commitment shares or pay cash to the company to buy shares at market value top-up shares.
The employee receives dividends on these shares.
The plan awards a number of matching shares, equal to 1.5 times the number of commitment and top-up shares.
Participants are not entitled to dividends on the matching shares.
The plan vests three years from the date of grant.
The first vests at 40% if there is an EPS growth of RPI plus 10% over the performance period, and at 100% if there is an EPS growth of RPI plus 20% over the performance period.
The second vests at 50% if there is an EPS growth of RPI plus 80% over the performance period, and at 100% if there is an EPS growth of RPI plus 100% over the performance period.
Both awards vest on a straight-line basis between these maximum and minimum points.
EPS growth performance is measured from the start of the financial year in which the awards were granted.
indd 78 26 3 08 10:34:21 Galiform plc Annual Report 2007 d Executive Co-investment Plan This is a co-investment plan where each participant is permitted to invest a limited amount of shares on an annual basis for the purposes of the Plan.
i. Pre-2007 awards The plan grants a number of matching shares, equal to twice the number of commitment shares.
The plan also grants a number of matching options, with an option price equal to the market price on the day of grant equal to twice the number of commitment shares.
The performance conditions are measured over a three year period.
Vesting is as follows: 20% of the Matching Award will vest if the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR is at the median level against the FTSE-250 constituents the Comparator Group rising on a straight line basis to 50% of the Matching Award vesting for upper quartile performance, and in addition 20% of the Matching Award will vest if average Earnings Per Share EPS is equal to the Retail Price Index plus 10% per annum over the Performance Period, rising on a straight line basis to 50% of the Matching Award vesting when average EPS growth is equal to or greater than RPI plus 20% per annum ii.
At the end of a three year performance period, each invested share will be matched by an award of up to three matching shares if 2010 PBT of 135m is achieved: 25 percent of the maximum match i. e. 0.75:1 will be earned for achieving 2010 PBT of 110m and the awards will vest on a sliding scale between these two points TSR target.
A further match of up to two shares will be made for achieving upper quartile Total Shareholder Return TSR, measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts e Foundation Plan i.

There is a further deferral period of two years before the awards are made available to the participants.
Vestings of awards granted in the form of nil-cost options depended on the achievement of a share price hurdle over thirty consecutive dealing days.
15% of the award vests for the achievement of 95 pence and 100% of the award vests for the achievement of 125 pence.
The award vests on a straight line basis between these two points.
Vesting of awards granted in the form of options with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant vest depended on the achievement of a share price hurdle over thirty consecutive dealing days.
The exercise price of the options granted in 2006 was 92p.
35% of this award vests if the share price achieves 115 pence over thirty consecutive dealing days, and 100% of the award vests if the share price achieves 160 pence over thirty consecutive dealing days.
2007 award These awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options and vested on the last day of the 2006 7 financial year to the degree that the performance conditions had been met.
There is a further deferral period of two years before the vested awards are made available to the participants.
Vesting was dependent upon the achievement of a share price hurdle over thirty consecutive dealing days and an underlying profit target of 65m for the year being met.
20% of the award vests if the share price achieves 150 pence over thirty consecutive dealing days and 100% of the award vests if the share price achieves 185 pence over thirty consecutive dealing days.
The award vests on a straight-line basis between these two points.
f Executive Share Options This is a discretionary share option plan.

Sharesave schemes are valued using a Black Scholes model as they are not considered to be of such complexity that they require a binomial model.
The key assumptions used in the models were: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 29 December 2007 30 December 2006 Dividend yield % 2.0 1.75 to 4.0 Expected share price volatility % 36.0 to 39.0 38.7 to 41.0 Historical volatility % 36.0 to 39.0 38.7 to 41.0 Risk-free interest rate % 5.0 to 5.8 3.8 to 5.3 Expected life of options years 2.5 to 3.2 1.0 to 6.5 Historical volatility is measured for each scheme over the period equal to the vesting period of the scheme.
The figure arrived at is then used as the best estimate of expected future volatility.
