NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31st December 2007 1.
Comparative Reclassification Interest income arising on own cash has been included as part of net finance income cost from 2007 to reflect the way the Group reports interest earnings internally.
As a consequence, interest earned on own cash during 2006 has been reclassified to net finance income cost.
There is no impact on the reported profit before taxation for 2006.
Alternative Income Statement The format of the consolidated income statement on page 44 conforms to the requirements of IFRS.
The alternative income statement set out below, which is provided by way of additional information, has been prepared on a basis that conforms more closely to the approach adopted by the Group in assessing its performance.
