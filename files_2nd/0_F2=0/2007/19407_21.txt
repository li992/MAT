QUINTAIN ESTATES AND DEVELOPMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 100 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2007 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED iv FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Creditworthiness evaluations are performed on all potential tenants looking to enter into lease or pre-lease agreements with the Group.
In certain cases, the Group will require collateral to support these lease obligations.
This usually takes the form of a rent deposit, parent company guarantee or a bank guarantee.
Where the Group places short term deposits, counterparties must have a short term credit rating of at least A1 P1.
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties with whom the Group has a signed ISDA agreement as well as having good investment grade credit ratings.
Given their high credit ratings, the Board does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
On 31 December 2006, the Property Index-linked Total Return Swap entered into by the Group in the comparative year expired.
The credit risk on this instrument was limited as the counterparty was a bank with a credit rating assigned by an international credit rating agency.
