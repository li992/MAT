Retirement benefit obligations The Group has various pension schemes throughout the world and these cover a significant proportion of current employees.
The principal schemes are of the funded defined benefit type, with benefits accruing based on salary and length of service.
The schemes assets are held in external funds administered by trustees and managed professionally.
Regular assessments are carried out by independent actuaries and the long-term contribution rates decided on the basis of their recommendations, after discussions with trustees and the plan sponsor.
There are also a number of defined contribution schemes where benefits are limited to contributions.
In the UK, US, Canada and South Africa, the Group has certain post-retirement medical benefit schemes whereby the Group contributes towards medical costs for certain retirees.
These contributions are paid only for retirees who were members of such medical schemes before retirement.
Analysis of the Group post-retirement cost included in profit from operations is set out below: 2007 2006 m m UK defined benefit schemes 45 37 Overseas defined benefit schemes 30 33 Overseas defined contribution schemes 24 20 Total 99 90 Of the charge for the year, in respect of defined benefit schemes, recorded within profit from operations, 39 million 2006: 36 million has been included in cost of sales, 36 million 2006: 33 million has been included in Administrative expenses and in 2007, there has been no expense included within Restructuring 2006: 1 million.
Expected return on assets net of unwind of discount of 29 million 2006: 25 million has been recorded in Investment revenue.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the Statement of recognised income and expense.
Main financial assumptions as at year end: 2007 2007 2006 2006 %% %% UK Overseas UK Overseas schemes schemes schemes schemes Rate of increase in salaries 4.25 3.54.25 4.5 4.04.25 1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.25 2.15 3.0 2.15 1 Rate of increase for deferred pensioners 3.25 2.15 3.0 2.15 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.80 5.256.0 5.1 4.755.9 Inflation 3.25 2.253.0 3.0 2.252.5 Medical cost inflation 5.80 5.09.0 5.55 5.09.0 1 Guaranteed pension increases only apply to the UK and Irish pension schemes.
The impact of a 1% change in medical cost inflation would be insignificant to the Groups financial position and results for the year.
In assessing the Groups post-retirement liabilities the Group monitors mortality assumptions and uses current mortality tables.
Allowance is made in all significant schemes for expected future increases in life expectancy.
The mortality assumptions for the UK scheme were updated in 2007 following the statistical analysis performed during the recent funding valuation.
The analysis demonstrated that in recent years, life expectancy had improved and, to reflect this, it was decided to alter the mortality assumptions.
The mortality table adopted PA8OC 2007 has been amended to reflect scheme specific experience.
In addition an allowance for future improvements has been accounted for in line with medium cohort assumptions.
In the US mortality assumptions appropriate to the population of the schemes have been adopted standard RP2000 tables and an allowance has also been made for expected future improvements in longevity.
In Ireland, an analysis of the mortality experience of the schemes has resulted in the mortality assumption being updated to standard tables PA92 to assume longer life expectancies.
Again, allowance has been made for expected future improvements in longevity.

In 2007, the Group elected to make an additional 21 million 2006: 61 million, 27 million 2006: nil and nil 2006: 6 million contribution to the UK, Ireland and US pension schemes respectively.
These payments were in accordance with deficit recovery plans agreed between the company and the trustees.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined after taking advice from external experts and using available market data, for example by reference to relevant equity and bond indices published by Stock Exchanges.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolio.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The Group expects to contribute approximately 70 million to its defined benefit schemes in 2008.
In addition, management agreed to make additional scheduled recovery contributions of approximately 28 million in 2008 to further fund its defined benefit obligation in the UK and Ireland.
Set out below are certain additional disclosures in respect of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme, Cadbury Schweppes Pension Fund CSPF, which represents approximately 70% of the Groups postretirement liabilities.
The CSPF scheme assets are held in a separate Trustee Fund.
The Trustee of the Fund is required to act in the best interest of the Funds beneficiaries.
The Trustee to the Fund is a corporate body whose board is made up of 10 members: 5 are appointed by the Company and 5 are appointed by the Pensions Consultative Committee a body that represents members interests.
The employer contribution rate is generally reviewed every 3 years at the time of the triennial valuation.
The Company requested that the 2008 valuation be brought forward to April 2007 to coincide with the decision to separate the American Beverages, thus enabling both the Company and the Trustee to quantify and understand their respective obligations to the CSPF.
The outcome of the valuation is that no further recovery payments are due.
The Group offers defined benefit retirement benefits to all of its current UK employees.
The retirement benefits provided to employees joining after July 2001 are based on career average earnings, revalued for inflation with a ceiling limit of 5%.
Benefits provided to members who joined the Group prior to this date are linked to final salary.
The principal disclosures regarding actuarial assumptions including mortality are set out above.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 9% Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 3.5% The Group has agreed the following funding objectives with the Trustee: 1.
To return the on-going funding level of the scheme to 100% of the projected past service liabilities within a period of 6 years measured in accordance with the assumptions set by the Trustee and its Actuary.
This has been achieved within 2 years from the 2006 funding plan, due to additional employer contributions and positive investment returns.
Once the funding level of the scheme is 100% of the prescribed bases then the agreement will be reviewed and a new funding plan agreed.
Although no further recovery payments are due, the Company will make an additional contribution of 18 million in 2008, outstanding from the 2006 valuation.
The funding plan will be reviewed at each subsequent triennial valuation and the funding position will aim to adjust for any surplus or deficit over reasonable periods.
The next review is scheduled for April 2010.
The most recently completed funding valuation for the Fund was performed by an independent actuary for the Trustee of the Fund and was carried out as at 6 April 2007.
The levels of contribution are based on the current service costs and the expected future cash flows of the Fund.
Following this valuation the Groups ordinary contribution rate will, with effect from April 2008, continue at the current rate of 15.5% of pensionable salaries net of any salary sacrifice arrangements.
In 2007 the Group contributed a further 18 million to the Cadbury Schweppes Pension Fund as a contribution towards the funding deficit identified in 2006.
In addition, the Group has agreed to a further contribution of 18 million in 2008.
The Group considers that the contribution rates and additional contributions agreed with the Trustee in 2007 are sufficient to meet future plan liabilities.
At 31 December 2007, the Funds assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities.
The fair value of the scheme assets, as a percentage of total scheme assets and target allocations, are set out below: Planned as a percentage of total scheme assets 2008 2007 2006 2005 Equity securities 40% 49% 52% 64% Debt 50% 42% 37% 24% Property 10% 8% 10% 9% Other 0% 1% 1% 3% In conjunction with the Trustee the Group has agreed to enter into a funding plan which includes discussion on the investment of its assets.
These discussions include the risk return policy of the Group and set the framework of matching assets to liabilities based on this risk reward profile.
The majority of equities relate to international entities.
The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of equities with at least 60% of equities being held in international equities.
To maintain a wide range of diversification and to improve return opportunities, up to approximately 20% of assets are allocated to alternative investments such as fund of hedge funds, private equity and property.
