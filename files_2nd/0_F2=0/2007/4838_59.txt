28 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company and an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
In other territories, the Group also provides other additional post employment benefits.
In particular, in Greece and Italy, the Group has state related obligations to fund post employment benefits to employees.
a Defined contribution pension schemes The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was 2.2 million 2005 06 2.3 million.
A further 0.1 million 2005 06 0.1 million provision was made in respect of the Nordic unsecured pension arrangement.
102 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Consolidated Financial Statements 28 Retirement benefit obligations continued b UK Defined benefit pension scheme actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2004 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
A further actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2007 is currently underway, however, results are not expected to be available until late in 2007.
The Groups contribution rate for the period ended 28 April 2007, agreed in consultation with the trustees actuaries, was 12.9 per cent 2005 06 11.9 per cent.
The contribution rate for future periods is currently planned to remain at this level.
With effect from 6 April 2007, the scheme will operate on a career average revalued earnings arrangement where benefits will be earned for each year of pensionable service as opposed to being calculated with reference to salary near to date of retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2004 used for determining costs and contributions were: Rate per annum Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.75% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.75% Discount rate for accrued benefits 6.5% Inflation 2.5% Investment return for future service benefits 6.75% At 5 April 2004, the market value of the schemes investments was 422 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 87 per cent of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The value of liabilities exceeded assets by 62 million.
c UK Defined benefit pension scheme IAS 19 The following summarises the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded status and amount recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Effects of commutation on valuation of UK Defined benefit pension scheme Up to and including the year ended 29 April 2006, in line with common actuarial practice, the actuarial valuation of the UK Defined benefit pension scheme did not take account of members exchanging pension at retirement for a tax free lump sum commutation.
Such an approach results in a higher valuation of the ultimate liabilities of the plan compared with that which would be generated if expected commutations were taken into account.
Following changes introduced by the Finance Act with effect from April 2006, the UK Defined benefit pension scheme has implemented revised terms for commutations such that a higher commutable amount is now permitted.
These changes amplify the difference in potential liabilities obtained by using the two different methods.
As a result of this and in line with actuarial practice which has evolved since April 2006, the Group has changed the valuation methodology to include expected commutations.
This change has had the effect of reducing the defined benefit obligation as shown in note iv below.
This reduction can be attributed partly to the change in commutable amount and accordingly has been accounted for in the income statement as a change in benefits as shown in note iii below.
The remainder of the reduction relates to a change in assumptions and has therefore been recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense as shown in note v below.

The demographic assumptions used are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2004.
In particular, post retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PMA PFA 92 C 2004, with a 0.25 per cent reduction to the discount rate in payment to allow for future mortality improvement.
Such tables represent an average expected longevity of 84.2 years for men and 87.4 years for women 2005 06 84.1 years for men and 87.2 years for women.
The current mortality rates include prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and also take account of historical experience.

Actual return on UK Defined benefit pension scheme assets was 44.7 million 2005 06 126.9 million.
The actual return on other post employment benefit scheme assets was not significant.

At 28 April 2007, the net obligation in relation to these benefits was 13.3 million 2005 06 12.6 million.
The charge to operating profit was 3.3 million 2005 06 3.5 million.
e Sensitivities The value of scheme assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the income statement and the balance sheet.
The main financial assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables.
Underlying charge before tax Net deficit Increase decrease: million million Discount rate: 0.25% increase 1.4 35.6 Inflation rate: 0.25% increase 1.0 17.7 Mortality rate: one year increase 1.4 18.3 The increase in scheme benefits provided to members on retirement is subject to an inflation cap.
