Staff pension schemes continued Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the Plans liabilities are entirely in Sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas equities.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the Plans securities.
These are held by an external custodian.
Overseas schemes The plan in The Netherlands is insured.
The value of the plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are in effect fixed interest instruments, so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
The plan in Ireland invests in pooled unitised funds, with returns reflecting the performance of the underlying assets.
At 31 December 2007, the assets of both the Portugal and Ireland plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.
e Other pension schemes The Group operates five defined contribution schemes: the schemes operated by Friends Provident, F&C, Friends Provident International Limited, Pantheon Financial Limited and Sesame Group Limited.
Contributions for the year were 0.1m, 4.4m, 0.6m, 0.1m and 0.4m respectively.
Lombard does not operate a staff pension scheme.

Share based payments continued b The Re-Investment Plan The Re-Investment Plan was a plan established to allow employees previously employed by F&C Group Holdings Limited F&CGH Group prior to the 2004 merger to voluntarily re-invest one half of their entitlement under the F&CGH Shadow Equity Plan SEP into ordinary shares in F&C and rights to receive further ordinary shares in F&C.
The Re-Investment Plan is primarily an equity settled scheme with an additional minor cash settled award being made in certain circumstances.
To encourage reinvestment, and in recognition of the fact that the Investment Shares carry forfeiture provisions, after three years participants will receive up to one Matching Share for each Investment Share subject to continued employment and achievement of performance conditions relating to EPS growth.
One third of Matching Shares have no performance criteria, while the remaining two-thirds vest in line with performance based on F&C Underlying EPS growth between 2003 and 2006.
The cash settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the F&C shares during the vesting period prior to becoming unconditional being notionally reinvested in F&C shares.
Once the award shares vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The number of Investment Share and Matching Share awards are as follows: 2007 2006 Investment Matching Investment Matching shares no.
The weighted average F&C share price during 2007 was 193 pence 2006: 201 pence.
The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
No valuation model was used as awards were granted at full market value.
