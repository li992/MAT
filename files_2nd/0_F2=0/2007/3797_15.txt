Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of changes in statutory tax rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% from 1 April 2008.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.

Of the total, tax losses of 2 million will expire at various dates between 2009 and 2013.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 2,726 million 2006: 1,850 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas operations as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The transfers column adjusts prior year goodwill so that it is on a consistent basis.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.

There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Groups customer base.
The year on year change in provision for the impairment of receivables is largely explained by the deconsolidation of the discontinued businesses.

The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate and cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policies.
67 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2007 20 Derivative financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources including the bank and public and US private placement markets.
Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is to match its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency earnings are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps are taken out which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to an effective amount borrowed by currency.
The borrowings in each currency give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into Sterling.
As the borrowings are either less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense rather than in the income statement.
Non-Sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
Interest rate risk As detailed above, the Group has effective borrowings in a number of currencies and its policy is to ensure that, in the short-term, it is not materially exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in its principal currencies.
The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that at least 80% of the Groups projected net debt is fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
Hedging activities Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates.
Cash ow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur between one and three years of the balance sheet date.
Net investment hedge The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge against the change in Sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives not in a hedging relationship The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair values have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments are traded.
All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short-term and long-term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and sundry other claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Environmental provisions are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
23 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 6% to 30% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 36 million 2006: 33 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are three main arrangements: i Compass Group Pension Plan, the Plan ii Compass Pension Scheme, the Scheme iii Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan, CRISP 71 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2007 23 Post-employment benefit obligations continued CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This is the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme will continue to accrue benefits under those arrangements.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP there has been a new defined contribution section established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan, CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP or to the Plan or Scheme will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Company's discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan and the Scheme are defined benefit arrangements that are closed to new entrants other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into special sections of the Plan, known collectively as the GAD sections, which have been certified by the Government Actuarys Department as broadly comparable to the relevant public sector scheme.
After a thorough review by the Group, the pensions accruing under the Plan and Scheme for service accruing after 6 April 2006 other than for the protected members in the GAD sections were reduced so that all members now accrue benefits on an 80ths of final pensionable salary basis.
In addition the link between pensionable pay and salary was removed so that pensionable pay from 6 April 2006 will only increase in line with salary up to a maximum of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index if lower.
This change, together with additional funding including a lump sum of 280 million in 2005 06 and a further 45 million in 2006 07 from the proceeds of the Selecta disposal and a reduction in the risk profile of investments means that the Group has taken action to substantially reduce the funding deficits in the UK over the last two years.
The Plan and the Scheme are operated on a prefunded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the Actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan and the Scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations were as at 5 April 2004.
The valuation due as at 5 April 2007 is under way and at an advanced stage, but the final results were not available at the time of the completion of this report.
However, a significant improvement in the funding positions is expected, even allowing for the updated mortality assumptions.
The Plan and the Scheme are reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The Chairman, Tony Allen, is independent.
The other five trustee directors are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, four of whom have been member-nominated.
The Plan has a corporate trustee with two independent directors, including the Chairman, Peter Morriss.
The other eight trustee directors are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, four of whom have been member-nominated.
The Scheme is a closed defined benefit arrangement and also has a corporate trustee.
The Chairman, David Bishop, is independent.
The remaining seven trustee directors are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In the Netherlands the Group operated insured defined benefit pension plans where the Group contributions represent the insurance companies assessment of the annual cost of the benefits earned in that year.
During the year the arrangements in the Netherlands have been closed and replaced with defined contribution arrangements.
The accrued liabilities arising from the defined benefit plans were transferred to the respective insurance companies.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
Varies according to the benefit structure.

The Group made total contributions of 110 million in the year 2006: 329 million including special contributions of disposal proceeds to pension plans of 45 million 2006: 280 million and expects to make regular ongoing contributions of 38 million in 2008.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period.
The actual return on assets was 100 million 2006: 104 million.
The cumulative actuarial loss recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense was 156 million 2006: 194 million.
An actuarial gain of 38 million 2006: actuarial loss 37 million was recognised during the year.
The deficit would have reduced to 70 million if the full surplus on certain schemes had been fully recognised.
IFRIC 14 only permits the recognition of a pension fund surplus where a company can clearly demonstrate that it can access the surplus through, for example, reduced future contributions.
The Group has taken the prudent view that it will not be able to access these surpluses, totalling 92 million, in the foreseeable future.

When exercised, holders receive a number of shares calculated by reference to the increase in the market price at that time over the option price as shown in the table above.
Any remaining share appreciation rights are shown in the table above as expired.
Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 345.64 pence 2006: 263.80 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.5 years 2006: 6.4 years for executive and management schemes and 1.5 years 2006: 2.5 years for employee schemes.
For 2007, options were granted on 30 March 2007 and 28 September 2007.
The estimated fair value of options granted on those dates was 90.97 pence and 62.10 pence respectively.
For 2006, options were granted on 14 December 2005 and 12 June 2006.
The estimated average fair value of these options was 41.97 pence and 45.88 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savings-related schemes were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The historical volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted under executive schemes: Assumptions options 2007 2006 Historical volatility 28.0% 31.6% Risk free interest rate 5.2% 4.3% Dividend yield 3.0% 4.6% Expected life 6.0 years 7.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 337.74p 211.59p Weighted average option exercise price 334.26p 210.67p Long-term incentive plan Full details of the Compass Group Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP can be found in the Directors remuneration report.

This is treated as a market-based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability was built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
78 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2007 26 Share-based payments continued The remaining 50% of awards made in the year to 30 September 2007 depend on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target for the three years from 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2009.
25% of the award will vest if GFCF of at least 859 million is achieved over the period and the full award will vest if GFCF of 959 million is achieved.
50% of awards made in the year to 30 September 2006 depend on the achievement of the GFCF target for the three years from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008.
25% of the award will vest if GFCF of at least 768 million is achieved over the period and the full award will vest if GFCF of 843 million is achieved.
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these two points.
The fair value of these awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the vesting probability being assessed based on a simulation model of the GFCF forecast.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for LTIP awards exercised during the year was 324.41 pence 2006: 225.47 pence.
The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years 2006: 1.6 years.
In 2007, LTIP awards were made on 8 March 2007 and 1 June 2007.
The estimated fair value of awards granted on these dates was 251.88 pence.
In 2006, LTIP awards were made on 14 June 2006.
The estimated average fair value of these awards was 120.00 pence.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each award.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of LTIP awards made during the year: Assumptions long-term incentive plan 2007 2006 Historical volatility 28.1% 28.2% Risk free interest rate 5.2% 4.7% Dividend yield 3.2% 4.3% Expected life 2.5 years 2.3 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 317.70p 206.25p Long-term bonus plan Certain executives participating in the Long-Term Bonus Plan in prior years received an award of deferred Compass Group PLC shares.
The award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following completion of a further period of service.
The following table illustrates the movement in the number of awards during the year.

The share bonus awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.1 years 2006: 0.6 years.
The estimated average fair value of share bonus awards made during the year was 280.56 pence 2006: 265.70 pence.
79 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2007 26 Share-based payments continued Income statement expense and carrying value The Group recognised expenses of 24 million 2006: 21 million for continuing operations and 1 million 2006: 4 million for discontinued operations in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Cash-settled share-based payments The Group has granted phantom share options to certain employees under the terms of the Management Equity Bonus Plan which mirror grants made under the Management Plan.
These require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the option to the employee at the date of exercise.
At 30 September 2007, the Group has recorded liabilities of 1 million 2006: 2 million.
The fair value of the phantom options is determined using the binomial distribution option pricing model using the assumptions shown above.
The Group recorded a total credit of 1 million 2006: expense 1 million during the year in respect of cash-settled phantom share options.
27 Business combinations Acquisitions in the year included the purchase of the final 5% minority interest in Onama S. p. A. for a consideration of 7 million and a number of smaller infill acquisitions for a consideration of 7 million.
12 million goodwill was recognised in respect of these acquisitions.
This included a fair value adjustment of 2 million which increased liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is attributable to the anticipated profitability that will be generated from an extension to the Groups operations.
Onama was previously accounted for as a subsidiary and therefore there is no impact on the Groups consolidated revenue or operating profits in acquiring the final 5%.
The impact on the Groups consolidated revenue and operating profits had the other investments been owned for the full year would have been minimal.
The Group also paid deferred consideration relating to prior year acquisitions of 17 million, leaving 6 million deferred consideration outstanding.
The total amount of cash paid in the year was 31 million.

81 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2007 31 Contingent liabilities 2007 2006 Contingent liabilities m m Performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities including those of associated undertakings 227 203 On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations UN.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it, in relation to this matter, in October 2006 but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group cooperated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has however not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has cooperated fully with the UN throughout.
In February 2007, the Groups Portuguese business, Eurest Portugal Sociedade Europeia Restaurantes LDA, was visited by the Portuguese Competition Authority PCA as part of an investigation into possible past breaches of competition law by the Group and other caterers in the sector.
The PCA investigation relates to a part of the Portuguese catering business which services mainly public sector contracts.
The Group is cooperating fully with the PCAs ongoing investigation.
Revenues of the Portuguese business for the year ended 30 September 2007 were 90 million r134 million.
It is likely that the investigation will take several months to complete and its outcome cannot be predicted at this point.
It is not currently possible to quantify any potential liability which may arise in respect of these matters.
The directors currently have no reason to believe that any potential liability that may arise would be material to the financial position of the Group.
The Group, through a number of its subsidiary undertakings, is, from time to time, party to various other legal proceedings or claims arising from its normal business.
Provisions are made as appropriate.
None of these proceedings is regarded as material litigation.
The Group has provided a guarantee to one of its joint venture partners over the level of profits which will accrue to them in future periods.
The maximum amount payable under this guarantee is 35 million, which would be payable in respect of the period from 1 July 2007 to 31 December 2010.
Based on the latest management projections, no liability is expected to arise in relation to this guarantee and accordingly, no provision has been recorded at 30 September 2007 2006: nil.
