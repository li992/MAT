Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 Basis of preparation note The Interserve Plc consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and comply with the IFRS and related Interpretations SIC-IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments and the related amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of this has been to expand the disclosures regarding the Groups financial instruments.
At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these Group financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating Segments: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions: IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements: IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes: and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements management makes certain judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements.
While these judgements are continually reviewed the facts and circumstances underlying these judgements may change resulting in a change to the estimates that could impact the results of the Group.
In particular: Revenue and margin recognition The policy for revenue recognition on long-term and service contracts is set out in note 1 d and e. Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regard to the recoverability of amounts due and liabilities arising.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcomes of these types of contracts, which require assessments and judgements relating to the recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in work scopes, contract programmes and maintenance liabilities.
PFI derivative financial instruments The Groups PFI PPP joint venture and associate companies use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate and inflation rate risks to which the concessions are exposed by their long-term contractual agreements.
These derivatives are initially recognised as assets and liabilities at their fair value and subsequently re-measured at each balance sheet date at their fair value.
The fair value of derivatives, assessed by discounting future cash flows, constantly changes in response to prevailing market conditions.
Measurement of impairment of goodwill As set out in note 1 b the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
In determining whether goodwill is impaired an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated is required.
This calculation of value in use requires estimates to be made relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows expected from the CGU, and suitable discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the specific economic environment of the relevant CGU.
Retirement benefit obligations In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the Group has disclosed in note 32 the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit obligations.
In the calculation a number of assumptions around future salary increases, increase in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation and the likely future return on scheme assets have been made.
Share-based payments In calculating the charge for the year, under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, certain assumptions have been made surrounding the future performance of Interserve Plcs earnings per share and the number of employees likely to remain employed for the duration of the plan.
In addition, in order to arrive at a fair value of each of the grants, certain parameters have been assumed and these are disclosed for the 2007 and 2006 grants in note 31.
62 Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies Interserve Plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The significant policies adopted by the directors are set out below and have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material to the Groups financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively.
Minority interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Minority interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the joint ventures and any newly acquired subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that company proportionately accounts for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
b Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition of IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP accounts value subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated undertakings.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minorities proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
c Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at closing rate is recognised directly in equity.
Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 63 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued d Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services supplied to external customers, the value of work executed in respect of provision of services and construction contracts and the rental and sale of equipment, excluding VAT.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts see below.
Investment revenue is recognised on an accruals basis.
e Construction contracts Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that it will be recoverable.
Expected losses are recognised immediately.
Stage of completion is estimated by surveys of work performed by quantity surveyors in conjunction with clients.
f Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses, provided that the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
The assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned property, plant and equipment: Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their expected useful lives.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between: Straight line Reducing balance Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% to 5% Leasehold property over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38% ii Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
iii The costs of operating leases are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
h Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets At least annually or when changes in market conditions suggest that an asset may be impaired, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
i Investments Investments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
j Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k Borrowing costs Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis or the effective interest method as appropriate.
l Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
In the case of PFI bid costs, on financial close of the project the Group may recover bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company.
If the fee exceeds the amount held by the Group as an asset, the excess is credited to the balance sheet as deferred income and is released to the income statement over a period appropriate to the risks concerned.
64 Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued m Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
n Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
o Financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and deposits Cash and deposits comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 65 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued p Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2004.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to value share options and the Share Matching Plan.
The stochastic model has been used to value the Performance Share Plan.
q PFI projects The Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts.
The balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the Group, and therefore the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as available-for-sale.
Income is recognised on PFI projects both as operating revenue and interest income: a proportion of total cash receivable is allocated to operating revenue by means of a margin on service costs taking account of operational risks, and interest income on the financial asset is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The residual element is allocated to the amortisation of the financial asset.
During construction the financial assets are carried at fair value which is assumed to be equivalent to cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is reasonably certain after making provision for contingencies, less any losses incurred or foreseen in bringing contracts to completion, and less amounts received as progress payments.
Costs for this purpose include valuation of all work done by subcontractors, whether certified or not, and all overheads other than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
Once the project reaches its operational phase, the fair value of the financial asset is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted future value of the cash flow allocated to the financial asset.
The movement in the fair value of the financial asset since the previous balance sheet date is taken to equity.
r Pensions The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff.
For the defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised directly in equity and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the income statement is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
s Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rates at which they are likely to reverse in the tax jurisdiction to which they relate.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which arise on the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and the tax base of the same item.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that there will be sufficient profits in the future to enable the assets to be utilised and reviewed at least annually.
Deferred tax liabilities are normally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax is charged credited to the income statement except to the extent that the underlying asset or liability is credited charged to equity in which case the deferred tax follows that treatment to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
t Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items that the Group consider to be non-recurring and material in nature that should be brought to the readers attention.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, cash flows, growth rates and margins during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on current Board-approved budgets and forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of future changes in the market these growth rates vary between 2% and 10% per annum.
The Group produces three-year plans and then projects a further two years based on growth rates of 2.5%, followed by a terminal value based on a perpetuity at a nominal 2.5% growth.
The rate used to discount the future cash flows is based on the post tax weighted average cost of capital 8.5%.

The impact of the change in rate from 30% to 28% is to reduce the retirement benefit obligation asset by a 1.2 million charged to equity and a 1.2 million credit to income relating to the acquired intangible assets, accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 million million Deferred tax liabilities 19.7 19.7 Deferred tax assets 24.8 33.4 5.1 13.7 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate tax value of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2.0 million 2006: 1.9 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of certain unused tax losses available for offset against future profits due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in those businesses.
The value of those losses is 2.2 million 2006: 2.5 million.

The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency exposure that arises on sales or purchases denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted.
Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2007.
Gains and losses arising on the re-translation of overseas net assets are recognised directly in equity.
The Group does not hedge re-translation differences.
The Groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is shown below where a change in value of foreign currencies against sterling would have the following impact on the results of the Group: 2007 2006 million million A 1% change in rate results: Change in profit 0.3 0.2 Change in reserves 1.3 1.0 b Market price risk interest rate hedges The Group uses interest rate caps and swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.

The contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and to the extent that the hedges are effective hedges, changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity.
The values of the hedges are provided by the relevant bank valuation models.
An amount of 0.1 million has been charged to the income statement in the year 2006: 0.1 million credit in respect of changes in the fair value of the hedges.
The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to manage the interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of instruments which are effective as hedges are recognised directly in equity.
Gains or losses on hedges held within joint venture entities that were recognised in equity during the year amounted to 23.8 million along with the associated deferred tax of 7.2 million 2006: 18.0 million and deferred tax of 5.5 million.
There were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges at 31 December 2007 2006: nil.
Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 85 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued The Group seeks to control its exposures to changes in interest rates by limiting their impact on the interest charge in the income statement.
This is achieved through the use of interest rate caps and swaps where appropriate.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rate to the Groups results is shown in the table below: 2007 2006 million million Interest rate For every 1% change in rate results: Change in profit 0.6 0.8 c Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
To manage this risk credit references are taken and where appropriate parent company guarantees are sought along with monthly monitoring of age and recoverability of debt.
Exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited by the Groups requirement to trade with counterparties with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The day-to-day banking requirements are met by local banks in each location with significant cash balances being remitted to Group treasury where any excess cash is put on deposit with reputable AA rated banks.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
d Liquidity risk The Group seeks to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure that it has access to funding to meet current and anticipated future funding requirements determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
The maturity of financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of interest rate hedges above, are discussed in the specific asset and liability footnotes.
e Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, whilst seeking to optimise the debt and equity balance, in order to maximise the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the cash, deposits and borrowings note 21, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent note 29.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements but is subject to debt cover and interest cover covenants in its loan agreements which ultimately limit the amount of debt that the Group can take on.

Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 89 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Contingent liabilities In the normal course of business, the Group is involved in disputes and litigation with third parties.
Appropriate provision has been made in these accounts for all material uninsured liabilities resulting from proceedings that are, in the opinion of the directors, likely to materialise.
At 31 December 2007 there were guarantees given in the ordinary course of business of the Group.
The Company has given guarantees covering bank overdrafts in its subsidiary and associated undertakings.

As part of the Office of Fair Tradings ongoing review of tender activity in the construction sector, it wrote to the Group with regard to potential breaches of competition law in respect of 16 tenders submitted between 2000 and 2005.
These tenders represent a very small proportion of the bidding activity during this period.
Given the stage of the OFTs review it is not possible to predict whether these enquiries will have a materially adverse effect on the Groups financial position or results of operations.

32 Defined benefit retirement schemes The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For each of these pension schemes valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2007.
As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Assumptions 2007 2006 Retail price inflation 3.3% pa 2.9% pa Discount rate 5.8% pa 5.2% pa Pension increases in payment: LPI RPI 3.2% 3.3% 2.9% 2.9% Fixed 5% 5.00% 5.00% 3% or RPI if higher capped at 5% 3.60% 3.50% General salary increases 4.05 - 4.80% pa 3.65 - 4.40% pa The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 December 2007 was 7.0% pa 2006: 7.4%.
The rate is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the pension schemes were invested in at 31 December 2006.
For 2007 a deduction of 0.4% 2006: 0.4% was then made from the expected return on assets for the expenses incurred in running the schemes where these were not met separately.
92 Interserve Plc Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Defined benefit retirement schemes continued The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation allows for future improvements in mortality and implies for the majority of the obligation that associated with the Interserve Pension Scheme that a 65 year old current pensioner is expected to live until age: male 84.8 2006: age 84.1 and female 86.9 2006: age 86.9.
A future pensioner who is currently aged 45 and retires at age 65 is expected to live until age: male 87.2 2006: age 85.1 and female 88.4 2006: age 87.9.
