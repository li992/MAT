Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 January 2007 1.
Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been consistently applied throughout the year and the preceding year is set out below.
a Basis of preparation and going concern The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued January 2003 and revised in December 2005.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe this is appropriate for the reasons outlined in the Directors' Report on page 18. b Investment income, interest receivable, expenses and interest payable Income from investments other than special dividends, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex dividend.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
Short term deposits, expenses and interest payable are treated on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged to revenue except where they directly relate to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case, they are added to the cost of the investment or deducted from the sale proceeds.
c Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date, measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue to meet the conditions required to obtain approval for the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
d Investments Listed investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs on purchases and sales are expensed through the Income Statement.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
e Dividends payable Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
f Capital reserve Realised Gains or losses on investments realised in the year that have been recognised in the Income Statement are transferred to the realised capital reserve.
In addition, any prior unrealised gains or losses on such investments are transferred from the unrealised capital reserve to realised capital reserve on disposal of the investment.
The cost of share buybacks are also deducted from this reserve.
28 Edinburgh US Tracker Trust plc Unrealised Increases and decreases in the fair value of investments are recognised in the Income Statement and are then transferred to the unrealised capital reserve.
g Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the Balance Sheet date.
Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses on the realisation of foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement and are then transferred to the realised capital reserve.

Risk management, financial assets and liabilities Risk management The main risk to the Company is the failure to track closely the S&P 500 Index.
The main risks associated with the Company's financial instruments are market price risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has established a framework for managing these risks which is evolving continually as the Company's investment activities change in response to market developments.
The Directors have provided the Manager with guidelines for the management of investments and financial instruments.
Market price risk The Company's exposure to market price risk comprises of changes in interest rates, valuations awarded to equities, movements in prices and liquidity of financial instruments.
In pursuing the Company's primary objective of tracking the Index, the Company does not increase the level of cash balances through the sale of equities.
Foreign currency risk The Company's portfolio is invested in US quoted securities, and therefore US Dollar exchange rate movements can significantly affect the Sterling value of the portfolio and income therefrom.
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of the portfolio or income.
Liquidity risk The Company's assets comprise of mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
34 Edinburgh US Tracker Trust plc Financial assets and liabilities The Company's financial instruments comprise equity investments, cash balances and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement.
Fixed asset investments see note 8 are valued at closing market prices, which equates to their fair value.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities are represented by their carrying values in the Balance Sheet.
The Company holds cash on deposit in foreign currencies.
The Sterling value of cash and short term deposits can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The tables below sets out the currency exposure of the cash and short term deposits as at 31 January 2007 and 2006: Interest Local Foreign Sterling rate currency exchange equivalent As at 31 January 2007 % '000 rate '000 US Dollar 5.00 8,125 1.9574 4,151 Sterling 5.00 503 503 Total cash on deposit per Balance Sheet 4,654 Interest Local Foreign Sterling rate currency exchange equivalent As at 31 January 2006 % '000 rate '000 US Dollar 4.00 8,635 1.7774 4,858 Sterling 4.25 579 579 Total cash on deposit per Balance Sheet 5,437 Cash and short term deposits are held in floating rate accounts.
