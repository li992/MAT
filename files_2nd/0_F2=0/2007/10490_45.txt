The amendment has the effect of attributing all surpluses, realisable through reduced future contributions, arising from 1 January 2004 to the Employer Surplus Account ESA.
The adoption of IFRIC 14 has resulted in the application of a more prudent basis to the valuation of the surplus available in the ESA and a retrospective pre-tax increase in the surplus restriction of 28 million as at 31 December 2006.
The basis applied reflects the minimum funding requirement imposed by the trustees of the MPF.
2 Underlying obligations are grossed up for the surpluses that exist.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected unit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2007.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 114% 2006: 111% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the schemes trustees and in accordance with local actuarial advice and statutorial provisions.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members.
Consequently, it is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The aggregate benefit obligation in respect of the unfunded plans at 31 December 2007 is 127 million 2006: 126 million.

The cumulative total recognised since 1 January 2004 is a gain of 8 million.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations, at the beginning of a reporting period, for returns over the entire life of the related pension obligations.
Expected returns may vary from one reporting period to the next in line with changes in long-run market sentiment and updated evaluations of historic fund performance.
