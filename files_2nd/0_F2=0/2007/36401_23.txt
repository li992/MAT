56 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2007 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of properties, financial instruments and pension liabilities.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the financial statements.
Management believes that the judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Critical accounting judgements include the classification of leases between financing and operating and the determination of profit taking on development management contracts.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March 2007.
Rent receivable This comprises rental income and premiums on lease surrenders on investment properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Lease incentives Lease incentives including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement over the lease term.
The value of resulting accrued rental income is included within the respective property.
Other property expenses Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specic properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the income statement as other property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Administration expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
Share-based payment The cost of granting share-based payments to employees and directors is recognised within administration expenses in the income statement.
The Group has used the Stochastic model to value the grants which is dependent upon factors including the share price, expected volatility and vesting period and the resulting fair value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market based criteria will not be met.
Investment properties Investment properties, including those under development, are professionally valued each year, on a market value basis, and any surpluses or deficits arising are taken to the income statement.
Disposals of properties are recognised where contracts have been unconditionally exchanged during the accounting period and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the property have been transferred to the purchaser.
Depreciation In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings over five years.
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease.
Development properties Development properties are carried in property, plant and equipment and are professionally valued each year, on a market value basis, and any surpluses arising are taken to the revaluation reserve with any deficits below cost taken to the income statement.
A development property is one purchased for the purposes of development, redevelopment or substantial refurbishment with relatively little, or short-term, income whether planning permission exists or is still to be granted.
All directly attributable costs of bringing a property to a condition suitable for letting are capitalised into the cost of the property.
Once development is concluded, the property is transferred to investment property.
Any cumulative revaluation reserve in respect of that property is transferred to retained earnings.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2007 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 57 1 Accounting policies continued Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method: the Group balance sheet contains the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures.
Long-term loans owed to the Group by joint ventures are included within investments.
The Groups share of joint ventures profit is included in the Group income statement in a single line.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Pension benefits The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
The full value of the net assets or liabilities of the pension fund is brought on to the balance sheet at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the Group statement of recognised income and expense, all other movements are taken to the income statement.
Capitalisation of interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development and development properties is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site or property for development properties, but does not include the original book cost of investment property under development.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specific associated borrowings.
Financial instruments The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet.
To the extent that a derivative provides an effective cash flow hedge against the Groups underlying exposure the movements in the fair value of the hedge are taken to equity.
To the extent that the derivative does not effectively hedge the underlying exposure the movement in the fair value of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
Convertible bonds Convertible bonds are partly carried as debt, based on the net present value of future cash flows and prevailing interest rates at the time of issue, and the balance carried as equity within an equity reserve.
Over the term of the loan, the debt is increased to its nominal value by charges to the income statement.
Head leases The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
Tenant leases Management have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Segmental analysis The Group has only one reportable segment on the basis that all of its revenue is generated from investment properties located in central London: accordingly no segmental analysis is presented.
Development management agreements Where the outcome of a development management agreement can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured as the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed bear to the estimated total contract costs.
Variations in work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the client.
Where the outcome of a development management agreement cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

This charge related to deferred tax in respect of revaluations of property, plant and equipment, derivatives and pension liabilities.
A deferred tax asset of 1.9 million relating to tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2007 was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset will arise.
60 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2007 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 6Tax continued The Group converted to a REIT on 1 January 2007.
From that date, the Group has been exempt from corporation tax in respect of the following: rental profits arising from its property investment business: and chargeable gains arising on the sale of properties from its property investment business, provided that the relevant property is not both: the subject of a development which costs more than 30% of the propertys fair value at the later of 1 January 2007 and the date that it was purchased by the Group: and sold within three years of the completion of the development.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will no longer be subject to corporation tax, it will have a very low tax charge over the coming years.
As a REIT, Great Portland Estates plc is required to pay Property Income Dividends of at least 90% of the profits excluding gains of the Groups property investment business calculated by tax rules rather than accounting rules.
In July 2007, the Group will pay a REIT conversion charge of 28.3 million, being 2% of the value of the properties within its property investment business as at 31 December 2006.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 provide for this conversion charge in current tax and show a write back of deferred tax of 135.4 million calculated as at 31 December 2006 relating to contingent chargeable gains, capital allowances and capitalised interest.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Finance Act 2006.
7 Earnings and net assets per share Earnings and net assets per share are calculated in accordance with the guidance issued in January 2006 by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
