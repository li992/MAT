4 Pension Schemes Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2006 for the main UK and Irish schemes and 31 December 2005 for the secondary UK scheme.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates two defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the scheme administrators.
During the year, the Group contributed 0.6m 2006: 0.7m to the defined contribution schemes.
The outstanding contributions as at 31 March 2007 were nil 2006: nil.

The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices published by The London Stock Exchange.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolio.

THE BSS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 8 Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period excluding those held as Treasury shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

i Other changes relate to the reallocation of goodwill as intangible assets, after further review of the intangibles acquired as part of the acquisitions were undertaken in the year.
Impairment Review During the year the management has carried out an impairment review for the goodwill carried in the balance sheet.
No impairments were identified as a result of the review.
All of the recoverable amounts were based on value in use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: Cash flow projections are based on board approved budgets for the financial year ending 2008 and 3 year plan for 2008 to 2010 Long term growth rates of between 3-4% The weighted average cost of borrowing WACB of the group of 5.28% The Directors are reasonably confident that the assumptions used above are accurate, although it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the assumptions were amended significantly.

The Companys payment obligations are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiary undertakings.
The facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
The disclosure above does not include the effect of issue costs.

Of the new borrowing, $75m is repayable in May 2013 with the remaining $50m repayable in May 2016.
In order to protect itself against currency movements and interest rate exposures, the Group entered into 3 cross currency and 3 interest rate swaps.
16 Derivative and Non-current Financial Instruments Derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to variable interest rates and currency movements.
Interest rate cap The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate cap contract at 31 March 2007 was 13.5m 2006: 13.5m.
The instrument matures in December 2007, it caps interest rates at 6.00%.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the private placing of $125m, the Company has entered into 3 cross currency swaps to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the private placement to 72m as well as fixing the exchange rates applicable to future coupon payments.
The currency swaps manage the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US$ denominated borrowings on the private placing which was completed on 11 May 2006.
There are 2 interest rate swaps on the 7 year borrowing of 29m and 14m that convert the borrowings on $50m and $25m respectively from 5.8 per cent to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a basis point increment of 64.75 and 66.79 respectively.
A further interest rate swap on the 10 year borrowing of 29m converts the borrowing on the $50m debt from 5.91% to a fixed rate of 4.7% plus a basis point increment of 70.75.
At 31 March 2007 the fair value of currency derivatives, all of which terminate after more than 5 years from the balance sheet date, was estimated at 1.6m 2006: 0.3 m. This amount is based upon the market values of equivalent financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 21 on interest rate swap contracts as of 31 March 2007 will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the US$ denominated borrowings note 15f.
All of these currency swaps are designated as effective.
Other derivatives The BSS Group PLC has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
No embedded derivatives existed as at 31 March 2007 2006: nil.

The Directors believe that the deferred tax asset will be realised as the deficits are reduced over the coming years.
In his Budget Statement of 21 March 2007, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed a number of changes to tax legislation that would impact the Groups balance sheet.
The most significant of these changes for the Group would be the proposed reduction in the mainstream rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% from April 2008.
This proposed change has not been reflected in the Groups balance sheet at 31 March 2007 since it was not enacted or substantively enacted at that date.
The legislation to enact these proposed changes has not currently been published, however the expected impact of these changes on the Groups net deferred tax asset is not thought to be material.
There is not expected to be any effect on the Groups current tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2007 as a result of these proposed legislative changes.
