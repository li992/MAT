Insurance contracts a Changes in insurance contracts liabilities The following table shows the movements in insurance contracts liabilities in the year: 2007 2006 m m At 1 January 13,762 14,637 Increase in liability from premiums 953 783 Release of liability due to recorded claims 1,524 1,506 Unwinding of discount 155 187 Change in assumptions: Economic 11 254 Non-economic 19 405 Other movements including net investment return 291 320 At 31 December 13,607 13,762 Included in the carrying amount above, 12,040m 2006: 12,095m is expected to be settled more than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
A liability adequacy test was carried out at policy level and resulted in no additional provision in either 2006 or 2007.
It should be noted that changes in the economic assumptions are typically largely offset by corresponding changes in the assets backing the liabilities.
In addition, assumption changes on with-profits contracts will result in changes in the FFA, and not in retained earnings.
The main items within non-economic assumption changes in 2007 relate to one-off items as set out in note 2 i.
The main change included within other movements is 256m 2006: 546m in respect of the investment return credited to asset shares and unit-linked liabilities.
b Method used for reserving for both insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF The liability for insurance contracts and unitised with-profits contracts is calculated on the basis of recognised actuarial methods having due regard to actuarial principles and best practice.
The methodology takes into account risks and uncertainties of the particular classes of longterm business written and the results are certified by the professionals undertaking the valuations.
Calculations are generally made on an individual policy basis, however in addition there are some global provisions which are calculated using statistical or mathematical methods.
The results are expected to be approximately the same as if an individual liability was calculated for each long-term contract.
The methodology for the calculation of liabilities is set out in more detail in note 1.3.
19. c Process used for assumptions i Economic assumptions Details regarding the economic assumptions used in the stochastic model for the valuation of with-profits policyholder liabilities are set out in note 29.
For other insurance liabilities and unitised with-profits contracts within the FPLA fund, economic assumptions are the same as those used for reporting to the FSA under the regulatory peak.
Economic assumptions are adjusted from year to year by reference to changes in consistent economic indices or yields on the underlying portfolio.
The principal assumption is the valuation interest rate.

Insurance contracts continued ii Non-economic assumptions The provision for insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF liabilities is sensitive to the principal assumptions in respect of mortality, morbidity and maintenance expenses except for net premium valuations, persistency and guaranteed annuity option take-up rates, although the relative sensitivity will vary depending on the class of long-term business.
Long-term estimates of future mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on standard tables wherever possible but adjusted to reflect the Groups own experience.
Expense assumptions are based on recent experience.
Experience investigations for mortality, morbidity, persistency, guaranteed annuity option take-up rates and maintenance expenses are performed at least annually.
Where industry analysis indicates that changes in expected future mortality morbidity or other assumptions factor patterns mean that claim costs are likely to rise in the future, then this is taken into account in the valuation basis.
No benefit is taken where industry analysis indicates that future trends are likely to reduce claim costs in the future.
Improving mortality has been assumed when valuing annuities and deteriorating morbidity has been assumed when valuing critical illness business.
Assumptions, for policies other than with-profits, are generally intended to be a prudent estimate of future experience.

Insurance contracts continued e Mortality, morbidity and lapse rates Insurance liabilities allow for mortality and morbidity risk by making assumptions about the proportion of policyholders who die or become sick.
Allowance for future mortality has been made using the following percentages of the standard published tables below: 2007 2006 Term assurances: Smoker 126% TM92 5 95% TM92 5 116% TF92 5 116% TF92 5 Non-smoker 58% TM92 5 58% TM92 5 63% TF92 5 74% TF92 5 Critical illness CIBT02 i Same as Term Assurance Other life assurances 80% AM F80ult 80% AM F80ult Unitised life policies 80% AM F80ult 80% AM F80ult Pension policies 35% AM F80ult 35% AM F80ult Individual Income Protection 60% AM F80ult 60% AM F80ult Individual pension annuities in payment RM FV00 ii 75% RM FV92 iii Group pension annuities in payment PCMA PCFA00 ii 95% PM FA92U2006 iii i The percentages of the table used differ by sex and smoker status.
ii Age-related percentages of the mortality tables are used.
Future improvements in mortality are based on the following percentages of the average of CMIs Medium Cohort and Long Cohort: Males 100% subject to a minimum of 1.5% per annum Females 75% subject to a minimum of 1.25% per annum iii Plus additional 0.25% per annum and 0.5% per annum for individuals and group males only respectively from 31 December 2003 onwards.
Individual income protection sickness and recovery rates are based on percentages of the CMI 12 male and female published tables.
Rates differentiate by smoker status, deferred period and occupational class.
Critical illness morbidity rates are based on percentages of the published CIBT02 table.
The percentages used vary by sex and smoker status.
In addition, future deterioration in morbidity is allowed for by assuming claim rates increase by 1.25% per annum and 1.50% per annum for males and females respectively.
Lapse rates for protection business are based on recent experience with a prudent margin.
f Apportionment of surplus between shareholders and with-profits policyholders Shareholders are entitled to 100% of surplus emerging from companies within the Group, with the exception of surplus emerging in the two with-profits funds.
i The Groups main With-Profits Fund is within FPLP, and is open to new business.
The Fund is run on a mutual basis and managed so that over time the working capital is sufficient to provide most of the risk capital but not to exceed the risk capital margin.
The entitlements of shareholders to share in surplus differ for policies written before and after demutualisation on 9 July 2001.
In respect of pre-demutualisation conventional with-profits policies, shareholders are entitled to one ninth of the cost of bonuses added to policies.
In respect of pre-demutualisation non-profit and unitised business excluding the investment element, shareholders are entitled to 60% of the surplus arising.
Post-demutualisation with-profits policyholders are only entitled to surplus from the return on their investments: other sources of surplus are wholly owned by shareholders including policies written by FPLA and Friends Provident Pensions Limited, where the investment element is reinsured to the FPLP With-Profits Fund.
