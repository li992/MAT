Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2006 07 65 Notes to the Group financial statements for the financial year ended 31 January 2007 10 Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and tested annually for impairment based on value in use.
Goodwill is tested more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
Cash generating units are independent sources of income and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at a country, divisional, regional or store level.
The carrying amount of goodwill by business segments are as follows: France France UK Group Darty BUT Comet Other Total m m m m m At 31 January 2007 1.1 168.1 13.5 182.7 At 31 January 2006 1.2 166.4 12.5 180.1 Included within the BUT goodwill is 136.7m 2006: 138.9m that arose on the acquisition of BUT in 1998.
The goodwill is allocated to the BUT segment for reporting purposes.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for the BUT goodwill were: future operating cash flows for the BUT business were derived using managements latest three-year estimates to 2009 10.
A terminal value was calculated based on the forecast for 2009 10. a long-term growth rate of 3 per cent was assumed for BUT turnover, which represents the expected growth rate in the French furniture market in line with current economic forecasts.
a post-tax discount factor of 8.5 per cent, derived from the Groups weighted average costs of capital, was used to discount the future cash flows.
The pre-tax discount factor was 12.9 per cent.
Whilst management are confident that their assumptions are appropriate, it is possible that there would be an impairment were there to be a change in certain key assumptions.
The carrying value of BUT is 380.7m, including 136.7m of goodwill and the recoverable amount, as measured by a value-in-use calculation, was 397.6m.
If the key assumptions were to move by the following amounts, then value in use would equal recoverable amount, assuming these changes happen in isolation: a The long-term growth rate fell 26 basis points from 2009 10 through to perpetuity, b The discount factor increased by 24 basis points, or c Forecast operating profit was 4.1 per cent lower in 2009 10 through to perpetuity.
No goodwill impairment was charged in the income statement during the year 2006: nil.
Other intangibles Other intangibles include amounts paid in order to gain access to certain leasehold premises.
The value in use of these intangible assets has been calculated using growth rates and discount factors considered appropriate for the relevant cash generating units.
The carrying amount of the other intangibles with indefinite useful lives is analysed by business segment as follows: France France UK Darty BUT Comet Other Group m m m m m At 31 January 2007 6.3 2.4 0.7 9.4 At 31 January 2006 6.5 2.4 0.1 9.0 66 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2006 07
