Notes to the accounts continued 1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Segmental information is presented in respect of the Groups geographical and product group segments.
The primary segment, geographical areas, is based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
The individual operations based in the countries within each geographic segment are considered to have similar operational risk and generate a similar level of financial return for the Group.
Inter-segment revenues are charged according to internally agreed pricing terms that are designed to be equivalent to an arms length basis, and have been consistently applied throughout 2006 and 2007.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one accounting period.
Primary Segment by Geographical Areas For management purposes the Group is currently organised into three operating areas: Europe: North America, Australia and New Zealand NAA : and Developing Markets and geographical segmental information is presented on this basis.
Segment revenue is based on the geographic location of the Groups customers and segment assets are based on the geographic location of the assets.

The profits arising on inter-segment sales are insignificant.
Segmental analyses have been prepared for operating profit as the Directors consider these to be more meaningful than analyses based on profit after tax.
The differences between operating profit and profit after tax are net interest expense of 24m 2006 36m and tax expense of 271m 2006 200m.

c Share-based remuneration All share awards that were not fully vested as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2007 and 2006.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Notes Scope: Executive Share Awards are awarded to the Top 400 Management Group.
Other Share Awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Individual tranches of these awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
Contractual Life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three-year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2006 or 2007 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payments transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
At 31 December 2007, the carrying amount of National Insurance contributions payable was 19m 2006 15m of which 14m 2006 10m was in respect of vested grants.
The weighted average share price for the year was 27.06 2006 20.88.
Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 37 Notes to the accounts continued 4 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED d Pension and other post-retirement commitments The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit pension schemes UK and US are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US retiree healthcare scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree healthcare benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2007 there were 2,738 2006 2,827 eligible retirees and 1,415 2006 1,414 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Defined contribution schemes 17 15 Defined benefit schemes net charge 11 9 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement note 2 28 24 For the UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2007 and updated at 31 December 2007.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2007 and updated at 31 December 2007.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the three major schemes as at 31 December 2007 were: 2007 2006 US US US US UK pension medical UK pension medical % %% %%% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.3 5.0 5.0 5.0 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred pensions 3.3 3.0 Discount rate 5.8 6.0 6.0 5.1 5.8 5.8 Inflation assumption 3.3 3.0 3.0 3.0 Annual medical cost inflation 9.0-5.0 10.5-4.5 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 7.9 10.1 7.4 10.7 Bonds 5.1 4.8 4.7 4.5 Other 6.2 5.9 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on the following tables: the average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2007 2006 Male 25.5 24.5 Female 27.9 27.5 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60, 20 years after the balance sheet date is as follows: 2007 2006 Male 26.8 25.8 Female 29.1 28.8 For the US scheme the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP2000 combined table.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 60 on the balance sheet date is 22.4 years 2006 22.4 years for males and 24.7 years 2006 24.7 years for females.

Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 41 Notes to the accounts continued 7 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 2007 938m 2006 674m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period 2007 715,039,130 2006 720,685,570.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Executive Options and Employee Sharesave schemes.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2007, there were 4.5m 2006 17.3m of Executive Options not included within the dilution because the contingent performance targets had not been met.
The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2007 2006 Profit for Average Earnings Profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 938 715,039,130 131.2 674 720,685,570 93.5 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding 17,345,740 12,365,411 and Executive Restricted Share Plan Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 1,240,227 1,145,515 On a diluted basis 938 733,625,097 127.9 674 734,196,496 91.8 Adjusted basis The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2007 2006 Profit for Average Earnings Profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 905 715,039,130 126.6 786 720,685,570 109.1 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding 17,345,740 12,365,411 and Executive Restricted Share Plan Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 1,240,227 1,145,515 On a diluted basis 905 733,625,097 123.4 786 734,196,496 107.1 The Directors believe that a diluted earnings per ordinary share, adjusted for the impact of the exceptional items after the appropriate tax amount, provides additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders in respect of earnings per ordinary share.

A number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.
The net book values of indefinite and finite life assets are as follows: 2007 2006 Net book value m m Indefinite life assets: Brands 2,908 2,926 Goodwill 830 834 Other 35 35 Total indefinite life assets 3,773 3,795 Finite life assets: Brands 9 10 Software 1 1 Other 28 36 Total finite life assets 38 47 Total net book value intangible assets 3,811 3,842 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 43 Notes to the accounts continued 9 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The annual impairment review for intangible assets is based on an assessment of each assets value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on historical operating results, short-term budgets, medium-term business plans five years and longer-term extrapolation.
The long-term extrapolations assume a growth rate of no more than the long-term inflation assumption for the relevant markets range of 2%-10%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% 2006 11% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
A higher rate is used where appropriate to reflect specific risks associated with the relevant asset.
Key assumptions which are kept under constant review by management in the impairment review include future sales volumes, growth rates and prices, and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
An analysis of the net book value of brands by product group, which the Group considers cash generating units, is shown below: 2007 2006 Product group Key brands m m Fabric Care Calgon, Vanish, Woolite 501 486 Surface Care Dettol, Lysol 562 559 Dishwashing Calgonit, Finish 160 147 Home Care Air Wick 173 191 Health & Personal Care Veet, Nurofen, Strepsils, Clearasil 1,494 1,526 Food Frenchs 27 27 Brands total 2,917 2,936 The impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2007 is 27m 2006 14m.

This transaction was accounted for as a merger.
During the year ended 31 December 2007 there was a debit of 14,371m to the merger reserve as a result of the Group reconstruction described in note 20 which was treated as a merger under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedge transactions that are extant at year end.
The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations that are not considered integral to the operations of the parent company, arising when the Groups entities are consolidated.
The reserve also contains the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net exposure in a foreign currency.

Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The fair values of cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, short-term borrowings and trade receivables and payables approximate to book value.
Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below along with additional disclosures relating to risk management.

The same was true as at 31 December 2006.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in US dollars, Euros and Australian dollars.
Nominal value resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2007 2006 m m US dollar 45 9 Euro 11 11 Australian dollars 9 36 Other 16 7 81 63 These forward foreign exchange contracts were expected to mature evenly over the period January 2008 to March 2009 2006 January 2007 to April 2008.
The contracts were fully denominated as cash flow hedges.
These hedges are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on forecast foreign currency cash flows.

Although issued in currencies other than sterling, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value due for repayment on maturity of these borrowings.
Financial risk management The Groups multi-national operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, and other instruments, to fix interest rates.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into the Group Treasury Centre GTC to achieve benefits of scale and control.
The GTC is not a profit centre, but adds value to the business operations by managing financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
The GTC manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
The GTC operates under close control of the Chief Financial Officer and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market Risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group publishes its financial statements in sterling but conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the results and the underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
As at 31 December 2007 65% 2006 54% of the Groups financial liabilities were in currencies other than sterling, including 10% 2006 10% being denominated in US dollars.
All the Groups major currency net assets exceeded the borrowings in the corresponding individual currencies.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with the GTC to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
The GTC matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
Major non-derivative monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives.
As at 31 December 2007 if the US dollar or Euro had strengthened weakened by 5% against all currencies with all other variables held constant, this would have an insignificant effect on consolidated profit or loss or shareholders equity 2006 insignificant.
In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship with all others held constant does not have a significant effect on the consolidated profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The largest fluctuation is in respect of a forward contract between the Canadian and US dollar when at 31 December 2007, if the Canadian dollar had strengthened weakened by 5% against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, shareholders equity would have been 2m 2006 nil lower higher.
b Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk.
Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 55 Notes to the accounts continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
The Group manages its interest expense rate exposure using a mixture of fixedrate and floating rate debt.
At the end of 2007, the Group had nil 2006 7% financial liabilities at fixed rates.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits and forward rate agreements.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the profit or loss of a 50 basis-point shift would be a maximum increase of 2m 2006 4m or decrease of 2m 2006 4m, respectively.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss potential is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 12.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating and balances at the balance sheet date.

Liquidity risk Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the overseas businesses are generally remitted to the corporate centre.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions, and have a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.
At the end of 2007, the Group had, in addition to its long-term debt of 5m 2006 11m, committed borrowing facilities totalling 2,485m 2006 1,225m, of which 1,225m exceeded 12 months maturity.
Of the total facilities at the year end, nil 2006 1m was utilised.
The committed borrowing facilities, together with available uncommitted facilities and central cash and investments, are considered sufficient to meet the Groups projected cash requirements, including the acquisition of Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc. Headroom between net debt and available facilities at 31 December 2007 was 2,360m 2006 313m.

Capital risk management Capital risk management is discussed in detail in the Business Review on page 9.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted spot rates at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows and applying the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments The notional principal values in this table have been calculated using spot rates at the relevant balance sheet date: 2007 2006 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward exchange contracts cash flow hedges 905 902 1,288 1,301 Total all current 905 902 1,288 1,301 The ineffective portion recognised in the profit or loss that arises from cash flow hedges amounts to nil 2006 nil.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 21 on forward exchange contracts as of 31 December 2007 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date unless the gain or loss is included in the initial recognition of a financial asset in which case recognition is over the lifetime of the asset.
