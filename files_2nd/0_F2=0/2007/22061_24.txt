Income in the year represents dividends received inclusive of any overseas withholding tax and gross interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2007.
Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited financial statements of the investee business.
The figures shown are the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax and net assets of each business.
Due to the varying rights attaching to the classes of shares held by the group, it could be misleading to attribute a certain proportion of earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity capital held.
