In addition, at every Annual General Meeting a certain number of Directors must retire by rotation.
Messrs Paterson and Taylor are retiring by rotation and Resolutions 2 and 3 seek approval for their re-election.
Biographical details for the Directors are set out on pages 26 and 27 of the Report and Accounts.
Resolution 8: This resolution authorises the Directors to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount of 837,720 being approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 3 December 2007, this being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.
This authority will expire 15 months from the date of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Except in relation to the Companys employee share schemes, the Directors have no present intention of using this authority.
Resolution 9: This resolution empowers the Directors to allot shares in the capital of the Company including shares which may be held in treasury as if the pre-emption provisions of Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply, provided that such power of the Directors is limited to the allotment of shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 125,658, being 5% of the Companys issued share capital as at 3 December 2007 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.
This power will expire 15 months from the date of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 10: This resolution renews the Companys general authority to repurchase up to 25,131,599 of its own shares in the market being 10% of the Companys issued share capital as at 3 December 2007, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, at or between the maximum and minimum prices specified in the resolution giving the authority.
Current legislation allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase in treasury, rather than having to cancel them.
The Directors may use the authority to purchase shares and hold them in Treasury and subsequently sell or transfer them out of Treasury as permitted in accordance with legislation rather then cancel them, subject to institutional guidelines applicable at the time.
Shares will only be purchased if to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders generally.
The Board has previously indicated its intention to continue to return surplus cash to shareholders via on-market purchase of its own shares where it is not required to finance the organic expansion of the business, acquisitions and dividend payments.

This represented 1.13% of the issued share capital of the Company.
If the Company were to purchase and cancel shares up to the maximum permitted by the resolution set out above, that percentage would increase to 1.25%.
Resolution 11: Following the passing of the Companies Act 2006, and in line with other large companies, the Directors are seeking permission to allow the Company to offer shareholders the opportunity to have documents and information made available to them through the Companys website and in electronic form.
