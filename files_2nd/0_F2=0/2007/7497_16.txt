General information Homeserve plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered oce is given on page 40.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the Chief Executives Review on pages 10 to 21.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
2. significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet eective: IAS 23 Borrowing Costs March 2007 IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim reporting and impairments IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the eective date of acquisition or up to the eective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Investments in joint ventures The Groups share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill.
Report & Accounts 2007 AR 2007 back half 20. indd 72 25 5 07 18:48:26 72 Homeserve plc Homeserve plc 73 Notes to the Accounts year ended 31 March 2007 Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written o to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Policy Membership businesses Revenue in respect of the Policy Membership businesses include amounts receivable from the sale of policies, stated net of commissions payable and Insurance Premium Tax.
Revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services where an appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant period.
Revenue from contracts of reinsurance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies.
All associated costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
If claims costs under reinsurance contracts are expected to exceed revenue, the shortfall would be charged to the income statement immediately.
Emergency Services businesses Revenue in the Emergency Services businesses represents amounts receivable, excluding VAT, from the sale of goods and services and is recognised on completion of the obligations relating to the work.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Report & Accounts 2007 AR 2007 back half 20. indd 73 25 5 07 18:48:27 74 Homeserve plc Homeserve plc 75 Notes to the Accounts year ended 31 March 2007 Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly.
Exchange dierences arising, if any, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation dierences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For dened benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benets is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on dierences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary dierences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary dierences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary dierences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary dierence and it is probable that the temporary dierence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sucient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Report & Accounts 2007 AR 2007 back half 20. indd 74 25 5 07 18:48:27 74 Homeserve plc Homeserve plc 75 Notes to the Accounts year ended 31 March 2007 Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write o the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 25 - 50 years Furniture, xtures and equipment 7 years Computer equipment 3 - 7 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives as follows: Customer relationships databases 3 7 years Franchise assets 3 15 years Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of 3 7 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the assets for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Report & Accounts 2007 AR 2007 back half 20. indd 75 25 5 07 18:48:27 76 Homeserve plc Homeserve plc 77 Notes to the Accounts year ended 31 March 2007 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the eective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provision, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
The Group records an expense, based on its estimate of the discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Restatement of deferred tax While not previously dened as provisional, during the year the Directors have reassessed the recoverability of the unused tax losses of Recommend Limited, trading as Improveline, a company acquired by the Group in 2006.
Tax losses with a fair value of 1,585,000 have now been recognised which has resulted in a reduction in goodwill of 1,585,000 at 31 March 2006 note 13 with a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets note 21.
The previously reported acquired net assets of Improveline were 2,344,000 resulting in goodwill of 9,093,000 and identied intangibles of 10,459,000.
Following the restatement, the reported net assets at acquisition would have been 3,929,000, resulting in goodwill of 7,508,000.
All other acquired balances remain unchanged.
This adjustment has no impact on the reported earnings or net assets previously reported in 2006.

Judgements and estimation uncertainty Revenue recognition Within the Policy Membership business, an appropriate proportion of revenue is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods.
As a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fullling those future obligations.
The Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods.
Impairment of goodwill The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill requires estimates of the value in use of cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated to be calculated.
As a result, estimates of future cash ows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash ows.
Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Provision of services 477,362 367,001 Investment income see note 8 1,030 702 478,392 367,703 Revenue from discontinued operations relating to the provision of services amounts to nil 2006: 2,188,000.
5. Business and geographical segments Business segments For management purposes, the Group is organised into two operating divisions, Policy Membership and Emergency Services.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the directors for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5% 2006: 2.5%.
The pre tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 11.3% 2006: 11.3%.

Insurance contracts The Group, through its subsidiary Affinity Partners Limited, enters into contracts of reinsurance with an independent insurance company that underwrites the policies marketed and administered by Homeserve GB Limited.
Under these arrangements, Affinity Partners Limited underwrites 50% of the risk and reward associated with these policies the policies.
The policies are entered into between the customers of Homeserve GB Limited and an independent insurance company in the United Kingdom only.
The policies are principally in relation to underwritten cover for a broad range of domestic emergencies relating to Plumbing and Drains, Electrical Wiring, Water and Gas Supply Pipes and Gas Boilers.
Revenue from the reinsurance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies typically 12 months, reflecting the period of benefit to the customer.
Where the reinsurance premium is received in advance an appropriate amount is included within deferred income.
The costs associated with the claims received under the contract of reinsurance are recognised as they are incurred.
An assessment is made of whether the expected cash inflows under the reinsurance contracts are sufficient to meet the expected future claims costs under the reinsurance contracts.
If a shortfall were to arise, this would be charged immediately to the income statement.
The amounts recognised by the Group in respect of reinsurance contracts are as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Revenue 43,054 34,916 Claims costs 42,666 34,761 Deferred income 11,212 9,225 The principal impact on the amount of claims incurred under the reinsurance contracts relate to weather conditions, which can impact the frequency of claims and the nature of the emergency.
In order to assist in managing the risk arising from the policies, the claims costs are fixed for each type of emergency repair.
There is no concentration of insurance risk due to the immaterial size of each of the policies.
Neither the policies or the reinsurance contract are exposed to any significant liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, nor are there any exposures relating to embedded derivatives.
As the policies relate to emergency repairs and generally cover a 12 month period, all cash outflows are expected to occur within 12 months from the date of commencement of the policies.
On a weighted average basis, across all policies, a 1 percentage point increase in claims frequencies would result in additional claims costs of 1.0m 2006: 0.9m.
