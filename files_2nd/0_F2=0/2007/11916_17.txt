Financial instruments and risk management The Companys financial instruments comprise amounts due to from subsidiary undertakings, cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and current and non-current borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, with all other financial instruments held at amortised cost.
The Companys approach to the management of financial risks is discussed on pages 22 to 24.
The Company believes the value of its financial assets to be fully recoverable.
The Company designates certain of its qualifying derivative financial instruments as hedges of the fair value of its bonds fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any change in the fair value of the hedged liability attributable to the hedged risk.
The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments is exposed to movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates primarily US dollars.
The Company estimates that a 1% increase in interest rates would result in a 9m decrease in the carrying value of its financial instruments, with a 1% decrease in interest rates resulting in a 10m increase in their carrying value.
The Company also estimates that a 10% strengthening in sterling would increase the carrying value of its financial instruments by 21m, while a 10% decrease in the value of sterling would decrease the carrying value by 25m.
These increases and decreases in carrying value would be recorded through the income statement.
