1 significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The company operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.
Fair value is determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to Findel plc shareholders are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Leases Operating leases Leases in which a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the periods benefiting from the incentives.
Retirement benefit costs For dened benefit schemes, the pension scheme assets are measured using fair values whilst the pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted using an appropriate discount rate.
The Findel Group Pension Scheme is a dened benefit scheme.
However, the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and, consequently, has taken the exemption afforded by FRS 17 Retirement benets to treat the pension scheme as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
For dened contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benets is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Cash ow statement The company has taken advantage of the exemption from the requirement of FRS 1 Cash ow statements to present a cash ow statement, as it produces consolidated financial statements which are available to the public.
