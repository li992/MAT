Nazomi In May 2002, Nazomi Communications, Inc. Nazomi led suit against ARM alleging willful infringement of US Patent No.
ARM answered the complaint in July 2002 denying infringement.
Following an original ruling in ARMs favour, Nazomi appealed and received a supplementary Markman hearing in 2005 that resulted in a decision that supported the original ruling.
On 13 February 2007, Nazomi again appealed and, on 21 February 2008 the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Courts claim construction and afrmed the District Courts grant of summary judgment in favour of ARM.
The period for any further appeal by Nazomi has now passed and accordingly this litigation is now concluded with judgment in favour of ARM.
In October 2005, Technology Properties Limited, Inc. TPL led suit, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Marshall Division, against certain companies in the Fujitsu, Matsushita.
NEC and Toshiba groups of companies alleging infringement of TPLs US Patents Nos.
All of the defendants are licensees of various ARM technologies.
It was revealed as part of the preliminary infringement contentions in the Litigation, led in July 2006, that certain ARM technology is alleged to infringe a single claim in US Patent No 5,784,584 the 584 Patent.
In September 2006, ARM led a motion to intervene in the Litigation and that motion has been granted.
ARM is now a defendant party in the Litigation.
The claim construction or Markman hearing took place in May 2007.
Based on the claim construction delivered by the District Court, TPL led a motion stipulating that the accused ARM technology does not infringe the 584 Patent with a request that final judgment be entered to that effect.
TPL subsequently led notice to appeal the claim construction to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Based on independent legal advice, ARM is confident that the Court of Appeals will uphold the claim construction ruling delivered by the District Court.
ARM does not expect any significant liability in respect of these claims.
Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party.
Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes such third partys intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notication from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: i information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements: and ii the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
There was no provision for such guarantees at either 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
