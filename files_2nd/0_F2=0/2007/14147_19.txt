These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turns out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
A 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way: many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offer of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice it is recommended that you: Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation: Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved.
uk register: The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted UK investors.
Any approach from such an organisation should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other appropriate action can be considered.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
