Consolidated Financial Statements 4 Non-underlying items continued v Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis.
IAS 39 requires gains and losses on the value of derivative contracts to be taken through the income statement based on their value at the balance sheet date.
Included within this amount is a remeasurement loss relating to a put option held by a minority shareholder.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.
