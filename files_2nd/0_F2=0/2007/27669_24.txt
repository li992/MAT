Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the European Embedded Value basis 242 supplementary information Notes to the European Embedded Value basis supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Basis of preparation This supplementary information has been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV Principles issued in May 2004 by the European CFO Forum.
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the preparation of this supplementary information.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2007 and the position at that date have been prepared on the same basis as that used in the 31 December 2006 EEV supplementary statements.
Covered business is defined as long-term business in the primary Financial Statements.
Covered business is traditional life insurance, long-term healthcare and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by the life insurance subsidiaries.
The results of Group companies providing administration and distribution services have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Following the acquisition of Skandia, covered business now includes the traditional life and unit-linked assurance business of Skandia.
Institutional investment platform pension business written in the United Kingdom has been excluded as it is more appropriately classified as mutual fund business.
Covered business results do not include services provided by Group investment management companies.
Unallocated Group holding expenses have been included to the extent that they relate to the covered business.
For South Africa the covered business excludes individual unit trusts and some Group market-linked business written by the asset management company through the life company as profits from this business arise in the asset management companies.
The treatment within this supplementary information of all business other than the covered business is the same as the primary financial statements.
Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of the products defined within the covered business.
The embedded value of the covered business is the sum of the shareholders adjusted net worth in respect of the covered business and the value of the in-force covered business.
The Group embedded value includes the value of all other business at the book value detailed in the primary financial statements.
Adjusted Group embedded value is a measure used by the directors to assess the shareholders interest in the value of the Group, includes the Groups listed banking and general insurance subsidiaries at market value.
The value of deferred consideration due in respect of Black Economic Empowerment partners and the value of own shares held in the employee share trust scheme are also included.
The adjusted net worth of the covered business is the market value of shareholders assets held in respect of the covered business, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
The level of required capital of the covered business reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business allowing for minimum local statutory requirements or equivalent where there is no local requirement, their internal assessment of the market, insurance and operational risk inherent in the underlying products and the level of capital required by rating agencies in respect of our United States business in order to maintain the desired credit rating.
The level of required capital is on average 134, 278 and on average 137 per cent of the minimum local statutory requirements in South Africa, United States and Europe respectively as at 31 December 2007.
The free surplus comprises the market value of assets allocated to the covered business in excess of the required capital.
The required capital in respect of the South Africa covered business is partially covered by the market value of the Groups investments in banking and general insurance in South Africa.
On consolidation these investments are shown separately.
The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the statutory distributable profits to shareholders projected to arise from the in-force covered business on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
Statutory distributable profit arises from the difference between amounts charged to policyholders for guarantees, expenses and insurance and the actual experience of these items, together with the investment return earned on shareholders assets.
Allowance has been made for the cost intrinsic value of financial options and guarantees to policyholders in the local statutory reserves according to local requirements.
In South Africa and Europe an investment guarantee reserve on a stochastic basis is included in the local statutory reserves.
A deduction from the value of in-force has been made to allow for the impact of future variability of investment returns on the cost of policyholder financial options and guarantees time-value to the extent that it is not already included in the statutory reserves.
This time-value has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques and represents the difference between the average value of shareholder cash flows under many generated economic scenarios and the deterministic shareholder value under the best estimate assumptions.
In the generated economic scenarios allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different circumstances.
The directors believe that the embedded value of the covered business is calculated in accordance with the CFO Forum EEV Principles.
The methodology and assumptions adopted within this supplementary information, including the recalibration of risk margins as referred to on page 255, follow the same approach as adopted in prior years.
The CFO Forum is in the process of developing a new set of principles and guidance in order to formalise an approach to market consistent embedded values MCEVs.
It is expected that these new principles and guidance will be published later this year.
Old Mutuals intention is to review its embedded value approach in the light of the new MCEV principles and guidance following their publication, and to carry out and publish a restatement onto the new MCEV basis in due course.

In South Africa, these values exclude items that are eliminated or shown separately on consolidation such as Nedbank, Mutual & Federal and intercompany loans.
For some European territories the value excludes deferred acquisition costs which are effectively part of the value of in-force of the business.
The RoEV is calculated as the adjusted operating profit after tax and minority interests of 932 million divided by the opening Group embedded value.
The impact of marking all debt to market value is an increase of 120 million at 31 December 2007 2006: 61 million.

The movement in value between 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 is due to the realisation of shares and is offset by a corresponding increase in equity in the Group embedded value.

The main operating assumption changes are a reduction in the secondary tax rate levied on dividends from 12.5 per cent to 10.0 per cent, a change in the way the interest rate is determined for unrecouped expenses for the Flexi product to more closely align movements in surrender value to underlying client values, an increase in the reserves held in respect of policyholder investment guarantees, and strengthening of the persistency assumptions in the Retail Affluent market.
This year, the risk-margin recalibration exercise did not result in any movement due to non-economic factors.
Last year the impact was significant partly to reflect the business sold since the previous exercise.
The methodology changes impacting cost of required capital reflect modelling improvements and methodology changes to the required capital which reduced the cost of required capital.
In aggregate, required capital is subject to a minimum of 130 per cent of the minimum statutory capital requirements.
A minimum level equal to the minimum statutory capital requirements is no longer imposed at a product level.
The net transfers from covered business in 2007 mainly include dividend payments net of dividends received from Nedbank and Mutual & Federal, tax on the special dividend, the purchase of additional shares in Nedbank, as well as head office expenses.
The embedded value for South Africa is after the adjustment for market value of life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments.
Return on embedded value is the adjusted operating profit after tax divided by opening embedded value in local currency.

The negative experience variances mainly arose from mortality losses on single premium immediate annuities and revised modelling of caps on the Fixed Indexed annuity block.
The main operating assumption changes include a strengthening of mortality assumptions on single premium immediate annuities and certain modelling changes made as a result of the actuarial review of the underlying models.
The economic assumption changes include revisions to the assumptions used in modelling spreads under Fixed Indexed annuity products.
In 2006, the actuarial model used to calculate the embedded value was replaced and upgraded.
This resulted in a reduction in the embedded value in 2006.
The methodology changes impacting cost of required capital reflects a change in the required capital in OMRe to accommodate the new Irish Capital Requirements.
The transfer to covered business is in respect of the release of capital and head office expenses.

The positive experience variances mainly arose from a higher level of fee income than that assumed, and a contribution from profits not valued, which was partially offset by negative expense variances.
The main operating assumption changes are the reduction in the future corporation tax assumption in the UK region from 30 per cent to 28 per cent and in Germany from 39 per cent to 30 per cent.
Lower asset based charges for the tick-the-box collective agreements and some corporate business have been assumed in the Nordic region.
The Nordic region has also introduced annuitisation of the corporate business and valued the Waiver of Premium business.
Persistency assumptions have been strengthened in Nordic, Italy and Germany.
The risk-margin recalibration impact arose in the Nordic region partly due to the introduction of annuitisation, where there is now the possibility to invest further during the retirement phase, which extended the duration of contracts.
The transfers from covered business include internal financing arrangements, allocation of head office expenses and the sale of VIDA Spain.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the European Embedded Value basis 251 supplementary information 9 Value of new business after tax The tables below set out the geographic analysis of the value of new business VNB after tax.
Annual premium equivalent APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10 per cent of single premiums.
New business profitability is measured by both the ratio of the VNB to the APE as well as to the present value of new business premiums PVNBP, and shown under APE margin and PVNBP margin below.
PVNBP is defined as the present value of regular premiums plus single premiums for any given period and is calculated on the same assumptions as for the value of new business contribution.

The South African healthcare business secured the administration of a large new scheme Medshield with recurring premium flow of 92 million per year in April 2007.
This premium income has been excluded from the value of new business due to its one-off nature.
The value of new business also excludes premium increases arising from indexation arrangements in respect of existing business, as these are already included in the value of in-force business.
The value of new institutional investment platform pensions business written in the United Kingdom, which amounted to 16 million in the year ended 31 December 2007, is excluded as this is more appropriately classified as mutual fund business.

Financials Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the European Embedded Value basis 254 supplementary information Notes to the European Embedded Value basis supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 12 Assumptions Introduction The principal assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business and VNB are set out below.
The assumptions are best estimate and actively reviewed.
Adjusted operating profit is calculated on closing operating assumptions and opening economic assumptions.
The effect of increases in premiums over the period for policies in-force has been included in the value of in-force business only where such increases are associated with indexation arrangements.
Other increases in premiums of existing policies are included in the value of new business.
New schemes written on which recurring single premiums are expected to be received on a regular basis are treated as new business.
The annualised premium is recognised as recurring premium new business at inception of the scheme and is determined by annualising the actual premiums received during the year in question.
Subsequent recurring single premiums received in future years are not treated as new business, as these have already been provided for in calculating the value of in-force business.
The value of new business has been based on opening economic assumptions and closing operating assumptions accumulated to the period end.
This is a change from the 2006 year-end where closing economic assumptions were used.
The sensitivity of the embedded value, the value of in-force and value of new business to key assumptions are set out in note 13.
Economic assumptions The pre-tax investment and economic assumptions are updated every six months to reflect the economic conditions prevailing on the valuation date.
Risk-free rates have a duration similar to that of the underlying liabilities.
Equity and property risk premiums incorporate both historical relationships and the directors view of future projected returns in each geography.
The risk-margins have been calculated using an approach consistent to that adopted as at 31 December 2006, and reflect the distinctive risks of the products in the respective business units.
These risk-margins do not include the risk associated with financial options and guarantees.
Where applicable, rates of future bonuses or crediting rates have been set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Projected company taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
For the South Africa business projected taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
Full allowance has been made for secondary tax on companies STC at a rate of 10 per cent that may be payable in South Africa.
Full account has been taken of the impact of capital gains tax.
It has been assumed that 10 per cent of the equity portfolio excluding Group subsidiaries will be traded each year.
The effective tax rate was 33 per cent for South Africa and zero per cent for Namibia, except for the investment return on capital for which the attributed tax was derived from the primary accounts.
For the United States full allowance has been made for existing tax attributes of the companies, including the use of existing carry-forwards and preferred tax credit investments.
The effective rate was 33 per cent.
For the Europe businesses, projected tax is based on the current tax rate that applies in each country.
In Sweden, no allowance has been made for additional tax on dividends remitted to the UK.
Tax has however been allowed for on dividends to be remitted to the UK from the Isle of Man.
The effective tax rates for Nordic, United Kingdom and the balance of Europe were a range of 2 to 28 per cent, 23 per cent and a range of 13 to 45 per cent.

Risk-margins The risk-margins above the risk-free rate were recalibrated as at 31 December 2007.
The South African risk-margin increased by 10 basis points as a result of changes in the level and direction of swap curves.
The United States risk-margin increased by 40 basis points reflecting the widening of corporate bond spreads over treasuries.
The changes in risk margins for the Europe covered businesses range from an increase of 40 basis points to a reduction of 50 basis points driven by changes in the level and direction of swap curves.
To the extent that they relate to economic items, the effect of these changes is included in the economic assumption changes.
Risk margin movement due to non-economic factors are included as a separate item within the adjusted operating profit.
The risk-margins for the risk associated with the time-value of financial options and guarantees and the allowance for required capital in excess of the statutory minimum have been presented separately.
Financials Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the European Embedded Value basis 256 supplementary information Notes to the European Embedded Value basis supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 12 Assumptions continued Non-economic assumptions The assumed future mortality, morbidity and voluntary discontinuance rates have been based as far as possible on analyses of recent operating experience.
Allowance has been made where appropriate for the effect of expected AIDS-related claims.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and the maintenance of business in-force.
The future expenses attributable to life assurance business include 37 per cent of the Group holding company expenses, with 15 per cent allocated to South Africa, 5 per cent allocated to United States and 17 per cent allocated to Europe.
The allocation of these expenses aligns to the proportion that the management expenses incurred by the business bears to the total management expenses incurred in the Group.
No allowance has been made for future productivity improvements in the expense assumptions.
Future investment expenses are based on the current scales of fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries.
To the extent that these fees include profit margins for the asset management subsidiaries, these margins have not been included in the value of in-force business or the value of new business.
The embedded value makes no provision for future development costs.
However, provision is included within certain business units for project costs where these are known with sufficient certainty.
Required capital For the South Africa business, the required capital is calculated for each of the major business units.
The non-investment items are based on a multiple of the non-investment components of the local Statutory Capital Adequacy Requirements set out in PGN104 issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa ASSA.
The investment item is based on internal models developed for capital allocation and pricing purposes.
The models project assets and liabilities for the business forward for 10 years using stochastically determined investment returns on a realistic basis.
Bonus rates and adjustments to non-vested bonuses are determined using a consistent formula based on a weighted average of past returns and the level of the Bonus Smoothing Account BSA at the time.
To the extent that the BSA falls to lower than normally allowable minimum levels, the shareholder is considered to be required to provide support to the business.
The capital requirement, based on the discounted value of the maximum shareholder support required, is determined using a conditional tail expectation at the 97.5 percentile level.
The required capital is invested in local equities, local cash and international cash.
The asset allocation as at 31 December 2007 is 60, 33 and 7 per cent respectively.
In aggregate required capital is subject to a minimum of 130 per cent of the statutory capital requirement.
The level of required capital was 134 per cent of the minimum statutory requirements as at 31 December 2007 146 per cent as at 31 December 2006.
The ratio declined over the year mainly as a result of modelling changes, which reduced the level of required capital.
For the United States business, the required capital is based on the multiple of the local Risk Based Capital RBC requirement that management deems necessary to maintain the desired credit rating for the company in question.
The multiples vary by company from 200 to 300 per cent and average 296 per cent as at 31 December 2007.
The required capital for Old Mutual Bermuda Limited is based on the level of capital considered by management appropriate to manage the business, which is calculated as 125 per cent of United States RBC calculated on local reserves, subject to a minimum of local statutory requirements.
The required capital for Old Mutual Reassurance Ireland Limited is based on the level of capital considered by management appropriate to manage the business which is based on 125 per cent of the new Irish Capital Requirements.
The required capital for the United States business is invested in fixed interest assets.
For the Europe businesses the required capital reflects the level of capital considered by management appropriate to manage the business, allowing for local minimum statutory requirements.
In certain regions, for example Nordic, statutory capital is partially covered by the deferred acquisition costs which are implicitly included in the value of in-force business rather than the adjusted net worth.
The required capital is invested in short and medium-term fixed interest assets.
The required capital as a percentage of minimum statutory capital in the United Kingdom excluding the Isle of Man reduced from 200 per cent to 180 per cent.
For other Skandia territories, the percentages have remained broadly the same and are: 73 per cent for Nordic, 200 per cent for the Isle of Man and ranging from 63 per cent to 240 per cent for the balance of Europe.
Financial options and guarantees South Africa As required by the applicable Actuarial Society of South Africa guidance note, the time-value of the financial options and guarantees included in the statutory reserves in the South Africa businesses as at 31 December 2007 has been valued using a proprietary risk-neutral market consistent asset model.
The asset model and calibration input is supplied by a proprietary economic scenario generator.
This represents a change from the random walk, log-normal real world stochastic asset model used to quantify the time-value reserve as at 31 December 2006.
The time-value reserves relate mainly to the guarantees detailed below: Individual business: A closed block of unit-linked and with-profit business has an underlying minimum growth rate guarantee 4.28 per cent per annum for life and endowment business and 4.78 per cent per annum for retirement annuity business applicable when calculating death, disability and maturity claims.
A small block of with-profits business guarantees minimum values to the policyholder at a point in time, generally five years from inception.
If the guarantee is not exercised, another guarantee may be set.
A small block of Retail Mass market with-profits savings business that has death guarantees of premiums net of fees plus 4.25 per cent per annum investment return.
Retirement annuities sold prior to June 1997 contain guaranteed annuity options, whereby the policyholder has an option to exchange full retirement proceeds for a minimum level of annuity income at maturity.
In addition, with-profits business has vested bonus guarantees at certain future dates, which operate in conjunction with the options and guarantees set out above.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the European Embedded Value basis 257 supplementary information 12 Assumptions continued Financial options and guarantees continued South Africa continued Group business: There is a significant pre-retirement savings with-profits portfolio.
Vested bonuses affect the calculation of benefit payments when a member exits from the scheme as the face value is paid out.
If a scheme terminates, the lower of face and market value is paid out and the vested bonuses are not guaranteed.
A significant with-profits annuity in payment portfolio guarantees annuity payments once declared for the life-time of the annuitant.
Key assumptions: The mean returns and volatilities of the asset classes incorporated in the stochastic asset model for 31 December 2006 are detailed below.
Correlations between asset classes have been based on an internal assessment of historical relationships.
Mean interest rate Standard deviation 31 December 31 December 2006 2006 Equity 11.4% 22% Property 9.8% 15% Fixed interest 20 year 7.9% 13% Cash 6.0% 3% Means have been calculated using the weighted arithmetic average across all scenarios.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating returns for the required period in each scenario, taking the natural log of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
The risk-free curve used to calibrate the 31 December 2007 market-consistent asset model is shown in the table below.
The yield curve has been derived from mid swap rates at the calibration date.
Annualised zero-coupon bond yield 31 December 2007 1 year 11.5% 2 years 11.1% 3 years 10.7% 4 years 10.4% 5 years 10.1% 10 years 9.1% 15 years 8.5% 20 years 8.1% 25 years 7.8% 30 years 7.6% The market consistent asset model has been calibrated to South African ZAR option prices at 31 December 2007.
Annualised implied volatilities estimated using asset model output are shown in the table below.
The option contracts are specified as at-the-money with maturities of 10 years.
Annualised implied volatility 31 December 2007 1 FTSE JSE TOP40 index 25.4% 20-year ZAR interest-rate swap contract 12.1% 1 Due to liquidity problems in the ZAR equity option market, the market consistent asset model has been calibrated by extrapolating option implied volatility data beyond a term of 3 years.
As at 31 December 2007 the investment guarantee reserves held as part of the value of liabilities, which included allowance for reasonable management actions and a dynamic take-up rate on guaranteed annuity options, were sufficient to cover the time-value of options and guarantees.
There is therefore no separate cost deduction from the value of in-force business.
The investment guarantee reserve also includes a discretionary margin to allow for the sensitivity of the reserves to interest rate movements.
The discretionary margin is released in the value of in-force.
Financials Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the European Embedded Value basis 258 supplementary information Notes to the European Embedded Value basis supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued 12 Assumptions continued Financial options and guarantees continued United States The time-value of financial options and guarantees in the United States businesses are valued using a proprietary economic scenario generator.
"A ""real world"" stochastic model has been used with the initial position of the yield curve calibrated to 23 US$ denominated index linked government bond prices as at 30 September 2007."
Interest rate scenarios are floored at zero per cent and capped at 30 per cent.
Crediting rates declared for the fixed deferred annuity block of business vest fully.
They are subject to a minimum crediting rate which is specified in the contract.
Minimum surrender values are determined by this rate.
Fixed indexed annuities offer minimum crediting rates on the fixed portion of the product, minimum surrender values based on this and credit equity participation annually as a percentage of equity growth subject to a maximum.
This equity participation, which is subject to a minimum of zero per cent therefore vests annually.
The variable annuities offered to off-shore customers through Old Mutual Bermuda can offer various secondary guarantees, including a minimum death benefit.
Death benefits are subject to a minimum of the sum invested or value at any anniversary date if greater.
Notwithstanding the comments above regarding the vesting of credited interest, deferred annuities are subject to surrender charges as specified in the contracts.
The universal life policies specify a minimum crediting rate to accumulate account balances.
All deferred annuities offer a guaranteed annuitisation option on maturity.
The rates are set conservatively and typically have very low utilisation as customers in the United States value the choice inherent in a lump-sum payment.
The reserves for financial options and guarantees assume that the low historical take-up rates of around 1 per cent per annum will continue into the future, and are therefore insignificant.
Certain of the universal life contracts contain a feature that guarantees that the contract will continue, even if values would otherwise be insufficient, provided the customer has paid at least a stated amount of premium.
The mean returns and volatilities of treasuries along the yield curve are detailed below.
The mean-reversion to higher future interest rates inherent in the model is consistent with long-term historical patterns.
The interest rate scenarios generated by the model range from zero to 30 per cent.
Mean interest rate Standard deviation 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December Treasuries 2007 2006 2007 2006 6 months 4.4% 4.7% 4.2% 4.3% 1 year 4.5% 4.7% 4.3% 4.3% 5 year 4.9% 4.9% 4.2% 4.1% 10 year 5.1% 5.1% 3.9% 3.9% 20 year 5.2% 5.3% 3.0% 3.0% The means are calculated by accumulating a unit investment over the projection period in years for each simulation, averaging the accumulation across all simulations, and converting the result to an equivalent annual rate by taking the nth root of the average accumulation, minus 1.
Standard deviations can be calculated by accumulating returns for the required period in each scenario, taking the natural log of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
Europe While certain products within the Europe businesses provide financial options and guarantees, these are immaterial due to the predominantly unit-linked nature of the business except in the Nordic region where the value of certain financial options and guarantees have been taken in the opening fair value adjustments.
