Prior to this date the Group was owned by Anglo American plc.
Presentation of this ownership interest can be found in note 26.
2 Mondi plc also issued 50,000 5% cumulative 1 preference shares.
The Group classifies these preference shares as a liability, and not as equity instruments, since they contractually obligate the Group to make cumulative dividend payments to the holders.
The dividend payments are treated as a finance cost rather than distributions.
3 The special converting shares are held on trust and do not carry dividend rights.
The special converting shares provide a mechanism for equality of treatment on termination for both Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary equity holders.
  The Group participated in the share-based payment arrangements of Anglo American plc during 2006 and up to the date of demerger during 2007.
All of the schemes are equity-settled, either by award of options to acquire ordinary shares, under the Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS, or award of ordinary shares, under the Bonus Share Plan BSP, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The total share-based payment charge for the respective periods is made up as follows: 1 million 2007 2006 ESOS 1 3 BSP 5 2 LTIP 4 1 Total share-based payment expense 10 6 Note: 1 Included within the charge for 2007 is an amount of 8 million representing the accelerated charge on legacy Anglo American plc schemes, which were deemed to have fully vested on demerger.
The accelerated charge has been classified as an operating special item see note 5.
Disclosure of the assumptions used to fair value the awards made under these schemes is contained within the Prospectus dated 1 June 2007.
On demerger from Anglo American plc, the Group has cash-settled its obligations in respect of share awards made under these schemes, with the minor exception of outstanding 2004 ESOS awards in South Africa, which will be cash-settled as options are exercised by recipients over a period of two years from the demerger date.
The share-based payments reserve has been adjusted to remove the balance attributable to these schemes, thereby reflecting the elimination of Anglo American plcs equity interest in the Group see note 26 for further information on the Groups demerger accounting.
Financial statements Annual report and accounts 2007 MondiGroup 95 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements 29 Share-based payments continued Mondishareawards Subsequent to the demerger, the Group has set up its own share-based payment arrangements to incentivise staff, as well as certain transitional schemes to compensate relevant employees for the benefits foregone on outstanding Anglo American plc schemes.
The Group also operates equity-settled retention arrangements for directors and key management to provide for an orderly transition into the post-demerger period.
In addition, the Co-Investment scheme has been created for the chief executive officer of the Group.
All of these schemes are settled by the award of ordinary shares in either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to settle the awards made under these schemes in cash, except for the reimbursement of dividends foregone on BSP awards that vest.
The retention arrangements were instituted prior to, and in anticipation of, the demerger.
The associated fair value charge, attributable to the vesting period elapsed, has been recognised from 1 January 2007.
The fair value charges resulting from all other share awards made by the Group, attributable to the vesting periods elapsed, have been recognised from the effective date of grant.
The total fair value charge in respect of all the Mondi share awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2007 is made up as follows: million 2007 Retention see note 5 9 Transitional BSP 1 BSP 2007 1 LTIP 2007 2 1 Total share-based payment expense 13 Note: 1 The fair value charges associated with the transitional LTIP and Co-investment share award schemes are immaterial for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The fair values of the share awards granted under the Mondi schemes are calculated with reference to the facts and assumptions presented below: Retention Transitional Transitional arrangeMondi Limited BSP LTIP BSP LTIP ments Date of grant 3 July 2007 3 July 2007 3 July 2007 3 July 2007 3 July 2007 1 Vesting period years 1.8 1.8 2.8 2.8 2 2 2 2 3 2 Vesting conditions Expected leavers per annum % 3 3 3 3 Nil Expected outcome of meeting performance criteria at date of grant % N A N A N A 89 N A 4 4 5 6 4 Fair value per instrument R 61.33 61.33 64.23 59.12 59.88 Notes: 1 The number of years continuous employment service condition.

In addition, the level of vesting is determined by the congruence of market and Group performance outcomes with specified market-based and internal Group performance targets.
4 The average mid-market share price for the month ending 3 August 2007 has been used to quantify the fair value of each instrument-granted the base fair value, as adjusted for the present value of anticipated dividends foregone over future vesting periods.
5 Accrued entitlements to dividends on BSP awards are accounted for on a cash-settled basis and are included in the fair value estimate.
