The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the geography in which the CGU operates.
For the purpose of the analysis of each CGU within the business segment it has been assumed that the levels of turnover, operating profit and cash flows for the year ended 30 April 2007 will be maintained.
The cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.9% and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
