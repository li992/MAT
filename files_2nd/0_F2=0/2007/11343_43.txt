FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise bank borrowings, cash, liquid resources and various items, such as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables that arise directly from operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups operations are interest rate risk and credit risk.
There is limited foreign currency risk, as the large majority of financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling post-year-end this is not the case, please refer to note 31.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The main purpose of the financial instruments is to provide a hedge against the interest rate risk for the Groups financial liabilities.
a Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet, principally trade and other receivables.
b Interest rate profile The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and equity.
The Group borrows principally in sterling post year-end this is not the case, please refer to note 31.
Any surplus cash is invested in short-term bank deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
