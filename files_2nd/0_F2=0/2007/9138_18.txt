These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information.
This has increased the net assets of the Homes division with a corresponding reduction in the Centre and no overall impact on the Group.
As the Groups activities are primarily within the UK, no geographical segmental analysis is required.
Net operating assets represent assets excluding cash, bank overdrafts, long-term borrowings and interest-bearing inter-company loans.

Retirement benefit obligations Kier operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme This is the principal Scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
The assets of the Scheme are held under trust separately from those of the Group: the Trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002, existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2005 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the Schemes assets at that date were 369.8m which represented approximately 82% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 24.0m 2006: 46.5m which include special contributions of 11.0m 2006: 31.5m.
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2005 valuation date not covered by the above special contributions over a 10-year period to March 2016.
The Group expects to pay contributions for future service of 12.6m being 19.1% of pensionable pay plus 6.0m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2008.
The Pension Protection Fund PPF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
The contributions paid during the year and the pension charge, amounted to 3.9m 2006: 2.6m.
Kier Sheffield LLP Kier participates in this defined benefits scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in the South Yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003.
As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and ongoing past service liabilities of 65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Councils employment to Kier Sheffield LLP upon the start of the contract.
New employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLPs pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the project unit method.
The contributions paid during the year were 1.6m 2006: 2.1m.
Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 11.5% of pensionable pay which the funds actuary has determined is sufficient to meet ongoing benefits.
Other Schemes Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees who are members of a local government pension scheme.
The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid over the year.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 2.9m 2006: 3.4m of income losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

The majority of these have either lapsed or been exercised during the period from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2007.
A balance of 1,180 options remain outstanding to holders who suspended payments during the option period.
These have to be exercised by 31 December 2007.
Options were granted on 25 May 2007 at an exercise price of 2,500p, these are exercisable at the holders discretion from 1 July 2010 until 1 January 2011.

Share-based payments continued LTIP Awards made under the scheme are normally able to vest following the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing, and is subject to the Company achieving specific performance targets.
The awards which are taken as shares are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
These shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.
The dividends on these shares have been waived.
A description of these schemes and the terms and conditions of each scheme are included in the directors remuneration report on page 40.
Value of share schemes The fair value per option granted has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: LTIP LTIP LTIP Sharesave Sharesave 2005 2006 2007 scheme scheme award award award 25 May 29 October 1 December 3 October 2 October Date of grant 2007 2003 2004 2005 2006 Share price at grant 2,254.0p 604.5p 699.0p 1,065.0p 1,836.0p Exercise price 2,500.0p 625.0p nil nil nil Option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected volatility 26.4% 27.8% N A N A N A Dividend yield 1.2% 3.0% 2.8% 2.0% 1.4% Risk-free interest rate 5.7% 4.8% N A N A N A Value per option 445.0p 114.0p 633.0p 1,043.0p 1,756.0p The value per option represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Guarantees and contingent liabilities There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including joint arrangements and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business.
As part of the Office of Fair Tradings ongoing and wide ranging review of tender activity in the construction sector, it has written to the Group with regard to Kier Regional Limiteds conduct in respect of 20 tenders submitted between 2000 and 2005.
These tenders represent a very small proportion of the bidding activity of Kier Regional Limited during this period.
It is not possible to predict whether these enquiries will have an adverse effect on the Groups financial position or results of operations.
Financial instruments Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counter parties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counter party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate risk The Group has hedged its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of 30.2m of loan notes for 10 years from February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p. a.
The balance of the Groups borrowings are to finance short-term working capital requirements.
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Groups PFI and Property joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.

Financial instruments continued In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
