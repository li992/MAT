Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 35 Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group are made up to the Saturday nearest to 30 April.
The financial year for 2007 represents the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2007.
The comparative financial year for 2006 was 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share based payments which are measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Comparative amounts have been restated to conform with current presentation.
This relates to the recognition of trade and other payables due in over one year of 11.8 million, which had previously been shown as current.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal respectively.
Exchange differences The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the opening rate for the month in which the transaction occurs which is used as a reasonable approximation to the rate at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the period except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge when they are recognised in equity.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rate during the period.
Differences on translation are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative exchange differences for that operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services to customers outside the Group net of returns, sales allowances and value added and other sales based taxes.
Revenue from goods and services is recognised at the point the Group fulfils its commercial obligations to the customer, the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and collectability is reasonably assured.
Segment reporting A geographical segment has operations within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group recognises only geographical segments as the business operation is the same throughout the Group.
Share based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the vesting period.
Impairment The carrying values of assets are reviewed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is an indication of impairment the recoverable amount of either the asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is estimated.
Cash-generating units are used where an individual asset does not generate cash flows which are independent of other assets.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Other operating income Rental income earned on investment property is recognised, in other operating income, in accordance with the substance of the relevant rental agreements.
Profits or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts except where payment or completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange.
36 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Exceptional items Transactions which are material by virtue of their size or incidence such as major reorganisation costs are disclosed as exceptional items.
Tax Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted.
Tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity, otherwise it is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Purchased brand names and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Acquired software licences and software development costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the cost of the asset, on a straight-line basis, over its expected useful life.
The expected useful lives generally applicable are: Brands 20 years Computer software 7 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment, on a straight-line basis, to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives by asset category that are generally applicable are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful life Fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years Computers 5 to 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 7 to 10 years Investment property Property that is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation is separately disclosed as investment property.
Investment property is carried at depreciated historical cost.
Leasing commitments Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in fixed assets and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the period of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are released to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investment in subsidiaries The Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is recognised at cost and is accounted for net of impairment losses.
Income from investments is recognised in the income statement to the extent that post acquisition profits are received.
Distributions of pre-acquisition profits reduce the cost of the investment.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 37 1 Principal accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark down and shrinkage based on actual losses, ageing of inventories and sales trends.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the inventory to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted to the amount receivable or payable.
Receivables are stated net of a provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and highly liquid investments.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts.
Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate model.
Provisions A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and also participates in a multi-employer pension scheme in respect of its employees in The Netherlands.
The assets and liabilities of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme and, therefore, accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The net retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in equity in the period in which they occur and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other income and expenses associated with the defined benefit scheme are recognised in the income statement.
The pension cost of defined contribution schemes is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
In accordance with its Treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are stated at their fair value.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the asset or liability for the hedged transaction is recognised in the balance sheet, the associated gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.
Gains or losses realised on cash flow hedges are then recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: 38 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Retirement benefits The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds.
The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions.
New standards and interpretations Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2006 07 but not relevant The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 30 April 2006 but they are not relevant to the Groups operations: IAS 21 Amendment Net investment in a foreign operation.
IAS 39 Amendment Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions.
IAS 39 Amendment The fair value option.
IFRS 1 Amendment First time adoption of international financial reporting standards.

IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment.
New standards and interpretations of existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following new standards and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 29 April 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures.
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
The Group will apply IFRIC 8 from 29 April 2007, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
The Group will apply IFRIC 10 from 29 April 2007 but it is not expected to have any significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating segments, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segmental reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard uses a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that being used for internal reporting purposes.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share transactions, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 provides guidance on whether share based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities for instance options over a parents shares should be accounted for as equity settled or cash settled.

Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 39 2 Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting segment is geographic, as this is the basis on which the Group is both organised and managed.
The Group does not report a secondary segment on the basis of business operations because business operations throughout the Group are the same.
The geographical sectors are: United Kingdom & Republic of Ireland UK & RoI and Poland, Belgium and The Netherlands Rest of Europe.
Central costs are incurred principally in the UK and are immaterial.
As such these costs are included within the UK & RoI segment.
Segment revenue, expense, result, assets and liabilities include transfers between geographical segments.
Such transfers are priced at arms length and are eliminated on consolidation.

42 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 5 Share-based payments Included within administrative expenses is 0.5 million 2006: 0.4 million in respect of equity-settled share-based payments.
The Group's employee share schemes are described below and additional detail is disclosed in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 24 to 29.
Scheme participants are either employees or Directors of the Company with one exception, who has a fair value entitlement to Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP shares amounting to 0.1 million the cost of which is spread over a three year vesting period.
The costs associated with all of the other scheme participants are accounted for in full in the Company's accounts.
i LTIP Under this scheme participants may receive annual awards in the form of contingent entitlements to Company shares.
These entitlements are equity-settled through the purchase of existing shares by the administering Trust.
The shares vest three years after award if participants remain with the Group during the vesting period and the Group meets targeted levels of total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth.
The performance conditions are fully described in the Directors' remuneration report in the section titled Long-Term Incentive Plan.
During the period contingent entitlements to 101,816 shares were awarded 2006: 121,518, vesting on 15 September 2009 2006: 20 September 2008.
The expense recognised in the income statement in respect of all LTIP awards is 0.4 million 2006: 0.3 million.
The fair values of the awards are determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model which takes account of the performance conditions described in the preceding paragraph, except for the one-off executive award to Mr Kenyon which is valued using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value per share is based on the expected number of shares that will vest.
LTIP shares do not earn dividends during the vesting period.
The Group's LTIP is administered by the Equity Trust Guernsey Limited which holds Company shares that will be used to satisfy the LTIP award.
These shares are classified as treasury shares in accordance with IAS 32. ii Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE Three and five year SAYE schemes were introduced in 2004.
Employees and Executive Directors are invited to subscribe for options over shares in the Company at a 20% discount.
The options are exercisable within six months from the third or fifth anniversary of the grant date.
The entitlement to share options is equity-settled.
Funds for the purchase of Company shares are built up through the contribution of a maximum of 250 per month from salary.
During the period options were granted over 73,633 shares in respect of a three year and five year award exercisable between April and October 2010, and April and October 2012 respectively.
The 2007 tranche of share options are exercisable at 1,040p per share 2006: 840p per share.
There are no vesting conditions other than continued employment with the Group until the respective exercise dates.
Share options were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The cost charged to the income statement in respect of this scheme is 0.1 million 2006: 0.1 million.
iii All Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP Under this scheme staff are invited to contribute up to 125 per month from pre-tax salary to purchase Company shares.
The Group does not incur a share-based payment charge in respect of this scheme since the Company shares are acquired at market value and are not subject to an accumulation period.

The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of the changes to be enacted in the Finance Act 2007 would be to reduce the deferred tax liability provided at 28 April 2007 by 1.2 million in 2007 08, recognised in the income statement, as a result of the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
The other changes to be enacted would have no further effect on the deferred tax provided at 28 April 2007.

Subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the proposed dividend will be paid on 28 September 2007 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 14 September 2007.
This would take the 2007 interim and final dividend payments to 50.0p 2006: 49.0p.
10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by Equity Trust Guernsey Limited see Note 5 which are treated as cancelled.
In order to compute diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary shares.
Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company's Ordinary shares during the period, represent potentially dilutive Ordinary shares.

Instead it is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Other intangibles are amortised and also tested for impairment when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill impairment, intangible amortisation and impairment and reversals thereof are recognised in full in administrative expenses in the income statement during the period in which they are identified.
Goodwill comprises purchased goodwill in respect of the Mays business and the Belgian and Dutch businesses valued in Euros.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units to which it relates.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 47 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations are based on 10 year profit projections adjusted for non-cash items, planned working capital movements and capital expenditure.
Cash flows beyond the first five year period are extrapolated at a constant growth rate of 2.5% 2006: 3%.
The growth rate is in line with long-term sales growth based on like-for-like sales of the Group between 2000 and 2007.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections are between 10% and 11% 2006: 10% and 11%.
Based on these calculations goodwill is not impaired.

A deferred tax asset of 1.0 million 2006: 1.0 million has been recognised in respect of a portion of these losses.
The Group has not recognised an asset in respect of the remaining losses due to the uncertainty as to how soon future taxable profits will arise.
Deferred tax assets of 1.1 million 2006: 1.0 million were available for offset against deferred tax liabilities of 24.4 million 2006: 20.7 million and hence net deferred tax liabilities at 28 April 2007 are 23.3 million 2006: 19.7 million.
54 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 24 Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates a variety of pension schemes, principally in the UK, Belgium and The Netherlands.
They comprise defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, and defined contribution schemes where the respective company pays a set contribution to the scheme.
The UK defined benefit scheme referred to in 24 i a and the first two defined contribution schemes referred to in 24 ii are accounted for by the Company.
i Defined benefit schemes a UK defined benefit scheme The Company operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The scheme was closed to new members on 31 March 2006.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company, being invested in a Managed Fund operated by SEI.
Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2005 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 91% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assets and liabilities of the Plan were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 28 April 2007 by a qualified actuary.
1 Key assumptions used: 2007 2006 % % Expected rate of salary increases 3.8 3.3 Expected rate of pension increases 3.0 2.8 Discount rate 5.4 5.1 Expected rate of inflation 3.0 2.8 Expected return on scheme assets 7.0 6.5 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions used for future life expectancy of members of the scheme are derived from industry dates and standard tables.
Specifically the PMA 92 table has been used for male pensioners and the PFA 92 table for female pensioners projected to Calendar Year 2007 for current pensioners and Calendar Year 2025 for current active and deferred members.
According to these tables the average life expectancy for a male at age 65 is 19 years, and for a female is 21 years.
The most significant assumptions are the expected return on scheme assets, salary increases and the discount rate, of which the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate.
If this assumption increased or decreased by 0.1% the defined benefit obligation would change by 0.2 million 2006: 0.2 million.

It is not possible to identify the Groups share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme, and therefore in accordance with IAS19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.
Under the terms of the scheme the scheme deficit is recovered through increased contributions from participating members.
At the period end the Group was unable to obtain a valuation of the industry schemes full surplus or deficit.
Contributions charged to the income statement amounted to 0.5 million 2006: 0.6 million.
c Defined contribution schemes With effect from 31 March 2006 the Company closed a defined contribution pension scheme to further contributions.
Contributions made up until that date by employees were matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by the National Provident Institution.
In the period ended 29 April 2006 Company contributions amounted to 0.5 million.
The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan GPP Plan in April 2006.
Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by Scottish Life.
Contributions for the period amounted to 0.7 million 2006: 0.1 million.
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and The Netherlands.
The Group makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by local insurance companies.
The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of nil 2006: nil and contributions to industry collective schemes were 0.1 million 2006: 0.1 million.

The Euro-denominated borrowings bear interest at the prevailing EURIBOR rate plus a margin.
Interest rate swaps were purchased to fix 75% of the floating interest charges due within the next three years at fixed rates of interest ranging from 2.66% to 4.66% 2006: 2.59% to 4.66%.
The maturity profiles of the interest rate swaps match that of the underlying hedged borrowings.

a Credit risk The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
The maximum amount of credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of financial assets.
b Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with the Groups bankers at commercial rates.
All accounts have an AA-rating as a minimum.
There are a number of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates of operating cash flow to fixed charge cover, and interest and capital repayments cover.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities i. e. bank loans, overdraft and finance leases excluding derivatives is as follows: Group Group Company Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Amounts payable within one year 13.0 14.1 7.7 8.0 Amounts payable between one and five years 11.3 20.6 1.9 7.8 Amounts payable after five years 3.4 3.8 1.8 1.8 27.7 38.5 11.4 17.6 Undrawn committed overdraft facilities are renewable annually and amounted to 35.0 million and a26.1 million 2006: 35.0 million and a24.2 million.

1 Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations in Euro-denominated and Zloty-denominated countries.
Foreign exchange risk is primarily in respect of exposure to fluctuations in the Sterling-Euro rate of exchange.
The Group finances foreign operations mainly through the use of foreign currency borrowings which hedge the net investment in foreign operations.
If the closing Sterling-Euro rate had been 0.01 point lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the SORIE would have been 0.1 million lower 2006: 0.2 million higher.
Financial assets and liabilities and foreign operations are translated at the following rates of exchange: Euro Euro Zloty Zloty 2007 2006 2007 2006 Average rate 1.48 1.46 5.77 5.61 Closing rate 1.47 1.44 5.54 5.61 2 Interest rate risk The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.
Interest rate risk is managed by purchasing interest rate swap agreements to hedge at least 75% of borrowings.
The remaining 25% is liable to interest at prevailing interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher in the period, the Group would have incurred an additional 0.1 million net interest payable 2006: 0.3 million.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group is as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average effective Floating Fixed Interest effective Floating Fixed Interest interest rate rate rate free Total interest rate rate rate free Total % m m m m % m m m m Sterling 3.4 11.6 7.3 18.9 2.7 7.6 9.2 16.8 Euro 0.4 8.8 0.1 3.4 12.3 0.6 1.7 0.1 0.3 2.1 Zloty 0.5 0.3 0.3 Total financial assets 20.7 0.1 10.7 31.5 9.3 0.1 9.5 18.9 Sterling 0.9 0.3 4.5 80.8 85.6 1.1 12.3 5.2 79.5 97.0 Euro 2.4 22.9 11.8 34.7 2.1 21.0 10.6 31.6 Zloty 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 Total financial liabilities 23.2 4.5 93.1 120.8 33.3 5.2 90.5 129.0 Interest on floating rate instruments is based on a margin over LIBOR or foreign equivalents.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2007 59 25 Financial instruments continued iii Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are classified in accordance with IAS 39.
Financial instruments have not been reclassified or derecognised in the period.
There are no financial assets which have been pledged or held as collateral.
None of the Groups loans are impaired.
In addition the Group does not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement other than derivatives.
There are no available-for-sale financial assets.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with their carrying amounts are: Group 2007 Group 2006 Company 2007 Company 2006 Carrying Carrying Carrying Carrying Nominal and fair Nominal and fair Nominal value and Nominal value and value value value value value fair value value fair value m m m m m m m m At cost: Cash and cash equivalents 20.7 9.3 14.7 7.5 Loans and receivables at amortised cost: Trade and other receivables 10.7 9.5 44.7 45.0 Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps 16.0 0.1 21.6 0.1 16.0 0.1 21.6 0.1 Total financial assets 16.0 31.5 21.6 18.9 16.0 59.5 21.6 52.6 Financial liabilities at amortised cost: Borrowings and overdrafts 23.2 33.3 6.9 12.4 Finance lease obligations 4.5 5.2 4.5 5.2 Financial liabilities at cost: Trade and other payables 93.1 90.5 80.9 79.5 Total financial liabilities 120.8 129.0 92.3 97.1 Net financial liabilities 16.0 89.3 21.6 110.1 16.0 32.8 21.6 44.5 Determination of fair values The fair values of derivatives are estimated using future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted discount rates based on market yield curves.
The carrying values of all other financial assets and liabilities are deemed to reflect fair value.
iv Hedge accounting a Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps denominated in Euros and Sterling have been executed to hedge the Groups exposure to changes in floating interest rates in respect of at least 75% of the Groups foreign denominated borrowings.
Hedge documentation is put in place at inception of all hedging relationships.
Effectiveness tests are performed at each reporting date.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
Changes in fair value are posted to equity in respect of the portion of the hedges which satisfy the criteria to be effective hedges.
Charges or credits relating to the portion which does not satisfy these criteria are recognised directly in the income statement.
At 29 April 2006 on fair value remeasurement a 0.1 million non-current asset was recognised in respect of derivative financial instruments.
There was no change in the valuation of derivative financial instruments in the period.
Cash flows in respect of the interest rate swaps are expected to occur at the same dates as the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
b Net investment hedges Euro-denominated borrowings are designated as hedging instruments of Euro-denominated net assets of the Groups foreign operations in order to protect the Group from currency risk in respect of the Groups Euro-denominated foreign operations.
Borrowing balances are carried at amortised cost which approximates fair value since borrowings bear interest at the prevailing floating rate.
The carrying value of borrowings amounted to a9.7 million 2006: a17.0 million.
