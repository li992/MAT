Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The effective tax rate can be reconciled to the UK corporation tax rate of 30% as follows: 2007 2006 % % UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2006: 30% 30 30 Tax charged overseas at rates other than 30% 3 3 Tax losses carried forward 1 Permanent differences 2 3 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of previous periods 1 1 Effective tax rate before one-off tax credit 35 37 One-off tax credit in respect of previous periods 5 Effective tax rate from continuing operations 35 32 The one-off tax credit arose following an intra-Group financial restructuring during 2006, as a result of which it is now anticipated that prior year UK tax losses can be utilised against future UK taxable profits.
Consequently, the Group recognised a 3.8m deferred tax asset in respect of these losses, which resulted in a one-off tax credit in the 2006 Income Statement.
The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
