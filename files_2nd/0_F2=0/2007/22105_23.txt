48 Candover Report and accounts 2007 During the year ended 31st December, 2007, the Group had two 2006: Nil share-based payment arrangements, which are described below: Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP provides for grants of share options at an exercise price equal to the mid-market quoted market price for the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
Options can be exercised three years after grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Share Matching Plan SMP The SMP enables the individual to invest in the ordinary share capital of the Company.
The investment may be matched dependent upon the net asset value per share performance relative to the performance of the FTSE All-Share index over a three year period, up to a maximum of 3:1 matching shares on a net to gross basis.
CSOP SMP Number outstanding at 1st January, 2007 Granted 29,675 181,465 Lapsed Exercised Outstanding at 31st December, 2007 29,675 181,465 Exercisable at 31st December, 2007 Number outstanding at 1st January, 2006 Granted Lapsed Exercised Outstanding at 31st December, 2006 Exercisable at 31st December, 2006 For awards granted during the year, the weighted average share price was 21.58.
The weighted average fair values are 4.00 for the CSOP awards and 21.67 for the SMP awards.
The weighted average exercise price for options outstanding at 31st December, 2007 is 20.99 and the weighted average contractual life is ten years.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: Share price: 21.05 for the CSOP and 21.67 for the SMP, being the share price at date of grant.
Exercise price: 20.99 for the CSOP awards and Nil for the SMP awards.
Expected volatility: 15.3% based on historic volatility over a period prior to grant equal to expected term.
Expected term: 6.5 years for the CSOP awards and 3 years for the SMP awards.
Expected dividends: 2.7%, based on historic dividend yield, zero for SMP as dividends vest to participants.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
Contracts designated as fair value hedges are offset against movements in the underlying loans and borrowings rather than taken to the income statement.
56 Candover Report and accounts 2007 At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding derivative financial instrument contracts is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Currency swaps 213,733 213,733 The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designated to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them, until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement costs of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the income statement.
Note 17 Deferred tax assets and liabilities No temporary differences resulting from investments in subsidiary undertakings qualified for recognition as deferred tax assets or liabilities.

The pension cost charge represents contributions by the Group to the schemes in respect of the accounting period and amounted to 1,424,000 2006: 1,153,000.
At 31st December, 2007, there was an amount of 113,000 payable to the schemes 2006: 85,000.
Note 21 Operating lease commitments Operating lease payments relating to land and buildings amounting to 1,750,000 2006: 1,631,000 are due within one year.
The leases of land and buildings to which these amounts relate expire in more than five years and are generally non-cancellable, although there is a tenant-only break clause in 2008 on one of the leases.

In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Board oversees the Groups risk management in conjunction with senior management.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, seeking to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
During the course of the year a loan facility was used to fund the acquisition of financial investments, and as discussed in the Chairmans statement, a US Private Placement of loan notes was successfully completed, which along with a revised multi-currency revolving facility, both of which are discussed in detail below, has provided the Group with an appropriate funding structure for its future investment requirements.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
However, due to the raising of funds under the US Private Placement partly in $US dollars and Sterling, as the Groups commitments alongside the Candover funds are in euro, the debt has been swapped into euro through derivative financial instruments.
Note 24.1 Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk see note 24.2, interest rate risk see note 24.3, and other price risk see note 24.4.
The Board of directors in conjunction with senior management, reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from the previous accounting period.
The Groups senior management assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Note 24.2 Currency risk Certain of the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses, are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency, and in which it reports its results, primarily with respect to the euro and the $ US dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future investment transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk Senior management monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies, and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Senior management measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Groups net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments are used to limit the Groups exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
As the majority of the Groups future investment commitments are anticipated to be in euro, US$175 million of the $ US dollar loan notes raised under the US Private Placement has been converted to euro liabilities through use of derivative financial instruments designated as effective fair value hedges.
Likewise the 30 million of funding received in January 2008 has been swapped into a euro liability.
To reduce the foreign exchange risk arising from future investment transactions, cash and cash equivalents are split by currency according to the anticipated long-term requirements.
61 Candover Report and accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2007 CONTINUED Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Group and Companys monetary items including financial investments and derivative financial instruments that have foreign currency exposure at 31st December are shown below.

The maximum and minimum net monetary assets liabilities amounts for each currency were as follows: US $ Euro Other 000 000 000 Year to 31st December, 2007 Maximum 51,306 277,352 41,148 Minimum 9,617 161,110 30,608 Year to 31st December, 2006 Maximum 51,306 219,264 38,676 Minimum 27,888 161,005 7,174 Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity in regard to the Groups monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for US Dollar and Euro.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar - 5% 2006: 5% Euro - 5% 2006: 5% These percentages have been determined based on a reasonable estimate of the potential volatility.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date, and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
If sterling had weakened strengthened amounts negative of those shown against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2007 2006 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 Revenue return 31 353 70 197 Capital return 506 13,825 2,466 7,790 Total profit after taxation for the year 537 14,178 2,536 7,987 Equity 537 14,178 2,536 7,987 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Groups objectives.
Note 24.3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities including unquoted loans the level of income receivable on cash and cash equivalents the fair value of the Companys loan notes issued under the US Private Placement linked to fair value movement and derivatives the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments.
As certain of the Companys loan notes issued under the US Private Placement are carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost, rather than their fair value, movements in interest rates also may affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value as measured using the accounting policies included in these financial statements.
63 Candover Report and accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2007 CONTINUED Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and funding decisions.
The majority of the financial investments that are interest bearing bear fixed interest: as a result, the Group is not subject to significant amounts of cash flow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates, further reducing such risks.
The loan facility is drawn down on a short-term rolling basis, each period fixed at the prevailing market rate plus margin.
The loan notes raised through the US Private Placement, were partly raised at fixed interest rates: these have substantially been swapped to floating rates set on a periodic basis at the prevailing market rate plus margin.
The Board and senior management reviews on a regular basis the values of the fixed interest rate securities and the unquoted loans to companies in which a private equity investment is made.
The Group finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The loan notes raised under the US Private Placement and multi-currency revolving facility are part of the Groups planned gearing.
Interest rate exposure The exposure for the Group and Company, at 31st December, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

The fixed rate exposures have mainly been swapped into floating rate exposures through the use of the derivative financial instruments, with a subsequent weighted average margin over EURIBOR of 1.40% to 1.44%.
The above year-end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, because the level of exposure changes as borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings as between floating interest rates and fixed interest rates changes.
The maximum and minimum total interest rate exposures during the year are shown below.
2007 2006 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure 240,309 214,844 455,153 198,139 212,069 319,208 Minimum interest rate exposure 8,561 223,546 214,985 29,702 182,247 211,949 2007 2006 Exposure Exposure Exposure Exposure to floating to fixed to floating to fixed interest rates interest rates Total interest rates interest rates Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure 44,513 410,640 455,153 107,969 211,239 319,208 Minimum interest rate exposure 8,561 223,546 214,985 26,280 185,669 211,949 Interest rate sensitivity As the Groups loan note investments are held at fair value through profit or loss and valued in conjunction with the equity investment in the investee company, the valuation policy to which is stated on page 25, these are not subject to changes in value arising from interest rate movements.
As cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market rates, for fixed short-term periods and held to maturity, they are not significantly impacted in respect of fair value by movements in interest rates.
As certain of the borrowings under the US Private Placement loan notes are held at amortised cost, the movement in interest rates does not impact upon their carrying value.
A 50 bps movement in interest rates would impact upon the combined valuation of the derivatives and related hedged US private placement loan notes by 50bps, a fall in value of 1,205,000 and 50bps, a rise in value of 1,256,000.
Note 24.4 Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of financial investments held by the Group.
Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future valuations of the financial investments held by the Group and classified on the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss, in accordance with the valuation policy as stated on page 25.
Management of the risk Senior management manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the investee companies and attending board meetings.
Additionally there is a formal internal review process to monitor the performance of each investment, including review by the responsible executives peer group.
Other price risks exposure The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st December on its quoted and unquoted equity investments: 2007 2006 000 000 Fixed asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 344,884 295,263 344,884 295,263 65 Candover Report and accounts 2007 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 2007 CONTINUED Concentration of exposure to other price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on page 7 and pages 18 to 24.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in European and UK companies: however, as the investments tend to be in multi-national companies, an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Other price risk sensitivity As the valuation of financial investments held by the Group and classified on the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss is determined by a number of factors, it is not relevant to provide analysis of the sensitivity of the profit and loss account to movements in the valuations of the investments as this is determined by a number of diverse factors both related to financial markets and the markets in which each investee company operates.
Note 24.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Groups financial investments consist of listed and unquoted equity investments and unquoted fixed income securities.
The Group manages its cash and cash equivalents in such a way as to ensure sufficient liquidity exists to meet requirements.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the Groups cash and cash equivalents are managed in a way to ensure that they are readily realisable to meet investment and operating needs.
In addition the Group has the multi-currency revolving facility of 100 million 2006: 50 million, which gives it access to additional funding when required.
The Board gives guidance to senior management as to the maximum amount of the Groups resources that should be invested in any one holding.
The more active use of the balance sheet, arising from the US Private Placement loan notes and multi-currency revolving facility, means that the Group could be potentially geared: however, the level of gearing is reviewed by the board on a regular basis and determined over the investment cycle.
Liquidity risk exposure Whilst the financial investments and cash equivalents generally have fixed maturity and repayment dates, as well as interest rate repricing dates, such instruments are seen as a package with the related equity investment in an investee company, hence their disclosure is not provided as it does not provide useful information.
The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31st December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: 2007 2006 More than 3 months More than 3 months 3 months Not more More than 3 months Not more More than or less than 1 year 1 year Total or less than 1 year 1 year Total Group and Company 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Borrowings under the US Private Placement loan notes 127,687 127,687 Derivative financial instruments 643 643 Payables interest payable 1,735 1,735 55 55 Borrowings under the multi-currency revolving facility 33,735 33,735 1,735 127,044 128,779 33,790 33,790 In addition to the above, the directors have authorised commitments of 500.0 million and 300.0 million, which will be invested pro rata and in parallel with the Candover 2005 Fund and the Candover 2001 Fund respectively.
66 Candover Report and accounts 2007 Note 24.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk, with no single investment exceeding 10% of the Groups net assets.
The credit risk of financial investments, such as loan notes, held at fair value through profit or loss, is considered as part of the price risk in valuing financial investments, this would include any related accrued interest on loan notes.
This risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: where an investment is made in an unquoted loan to a private equity investment, it is made as part of the overall equity and debt investment package, and the recoverability of the debt is assessed as part of the overall investment process transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default cash equivalents consist of short-dated listed fixed income securities and money market instruments, with a credit rating of AAor above cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Groups or Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
Investments that are by way of loans to investee companies are valued at fair value alongside the equity held in those companies using the valuation policy for financial investments which is stated on page 25.
As the split between debt and equity is merely a part of the structuring of an investment it is not appropriate to value them separately, hence the debt element is not disclosed separately.
The total value of investments at fair value through profit or loss and accrued income for both the Group and Company treated in this way were 364,352,000 2006: 312,158,000. Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts included in the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31st December was as follows: 2007 2006 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet exposure sheet exposure Group 000 000 000 000 Derivative financial instruments 643 643 Cash and cash equivalents 240,309 240,309 63,437 63,437 240,952 240,952 63,437 63,437 2007 2006 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet exposure sheet exposure Company 000 000 000 000 Derivative financial instruments 643 643 Cash and cash equivalents 230,230 230,230 59,858 59,858 230,873 230,873 59,858 59,858 Note 24.7 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Except for those financial liabilities measured at amortised cost that are shown below, the fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities, are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value financial investments and derivatives, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value accrued income and interest payable.
