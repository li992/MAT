The fair value of the equity instruments issued equalled the fair value of the underlying net assets of AMIL, a holding entity for the Mondi Group.
Prior to the listing of Mondi plcs shares on the LSE, the nominal share capital raised on the transfer of AMIL was reduced and transferred to the profit and loss account, net of share issue costs and a dividend in specie.
The share capital reduction was legally sanctioned by the UK High Court on 2 July 2007.
The dividend in specie represents the transfer of Mondi Limited to its own external shareholders.
Share issue costs have been taken to reserves because they were incurred in respect of, and are directly attributable to, the issuance of Mondi plcs equity instruments.
 Mondi plc has issued financial guarantees in respect of the bank borrowings of other Group undertakings.
The likelihood of these financial guarantees being called is considered to be remote and therefore the estimated financial effect of issuance is nil.
The fair value of these issued financial guarantees is deemed to be immaterial.
