84 Notes to the Company Accounts continued for the year ended 30 April 2007 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Share-based payments The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 and those not yet vested as at the effective date of FRS 20 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity as a non distributable share option reserve.
Amounts recharged to the subsidiary are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in subsidiary.
When the cost of investment in subsidiary has been reduced to nil, the excess is recognised as a creditor.
Prior Year Adjustment The effects of adopting UITF Abstract 41 Scope of FRS 20 is that opening retained profit as at 30 April 2006 has been decreased by 273,000 1 May 2005: nil.

Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
