The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Archer Street, Darlington.
The Group prepares its financial information for the financial year ending on the nearest Sunday to 30 September of a given calendar year.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group represents the following: 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 The consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC, including: the consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC and its subsidiaries for the period from 3 October 2005 to 1 October 2006.
52 weeks ended 30 September 2007 The consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC, including: the consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC and its subsidiaries for the period from 2 October 2006 to 30 September 2007.
The principal subsidiaries within the Group are disclosed in note 39.
2 Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Group considers goodwill, intangibles, provision for onerous leases and deferred tax to be the areas of key accounting judgements and sources of estimation.
These are discussed further below.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial instruments and share-based payments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 2 October 2008 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them: IFRS 7, Financial Instruments Disclosures, and a complementary Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures, are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2007.
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
It requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.
It replaces IAS 30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions and disclosure requirements in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital and how it manages capital.
The main additional disclosures will be the sensitivity analysis to market risk and the capital disclosures required by the amendment of IAS 1.
The Group will apply IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 from annual periods beginning 1 October 2007.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 41 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2007 2 Accounting Policies continued IFRS 8, Operating Segments effective from 1 January 2009 IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009.
The expected impact is still being assessed in detail by management, however no material changes to the Groups segmental reporting is expected.
At the period end, the following interpretation relevant to the Group, but which has not yet been adopted, was in issue but not yet effective.
IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements on adoption.
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 2 October 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Groups operations.
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 11 provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities for example, options over a parents shares should be accounted for as equity settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the parent and Group companies.
This interpretation does not have an impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements effective from 1 January 2008 IFRIC 12 applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services.
IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Groups operations because none of the Groups companies provide for public sector services.
2.2 Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 1 October 2006 and 30 September 2007.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets in acquired companies which concern resident contracts are recognised and amortised over periods of up to three years.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill.
Goodwill is not amortised: instead impairment tests are undertaken annually, and any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.3 Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of fee income relating to the provision of care services, net of price reductions directly related to sales.
Fee income comprises care home fees which are recognised when delivery of service is completed.
Fees invoiced in advance are included as deferred income until service is completed.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
2.4 Home Payroll Costs Home payroll costs represent payroll costs directly incurred at home level, including costs incurred in respect of the use of agency labour.
42 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 Accounting Policies continued 2.5 Home Running Costs Home running costs represent costs of items directly incurred at home level, including food and kitchen supplies, medical supplies, utilities, maintenance and other running costs of the home.
2.6 Home EBITDAR Before Central Costs Home EBITDAR before central costs represents profitability at a home level after taking account of home payroll and home running costs, but before rental charges on operating leases, central costs and depreciation on home assets.
2.7 Central Costs Central costs represent costs of head office support functions, including central payroll costs, other costs not directly attributable to a home level and certain other payroll costs.
2.8 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment and subsidiary undertakings.
Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA after adding back exceptional central costs and the charge for future minimum rental increases.
The Group believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and measures derived therefrom including Home EBITDAR before central costs and Home EBITDA before central costs facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting finance income and costs, tax positions, the age and book depreciation of property, plant and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and intangible assets identified affecting amortisation expense.
2.9 Exceptional Items Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall within the activities of the Group and which, by virtue of their size or incidence, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial information.
2.10 Use of Boxes in Income Statement Boxes have been used in the income statement to provide sub-analyses of items in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial information.
2.11 Segmental Reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
2.12 Other Income Other income relates to management income received in respect of a portfolio of homes operated by the Group on behalf of a third party, as well as other operating income.
Income is recognised on completion of the management service on an accruals basis.
2.13 Share-based compensation The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 43 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2007 2 Accounting Policies continued 2.14 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective position is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
2.15 Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at inception of the lease, with a corresponding liability being recognised for the value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term where property lease contracts contain guaranteed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term.
The charge for rentals currently payable is the actual amount payable, in the period, by the Group for its operating leases.
The charge for future minimum rental increases reflects the impact of recognising future-fixed committed rental increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.16 Onerous Leases Provision is made for future operating lease payments of vacant care homes for the full remaining lease term or up to the expected point at which the lease is expected to be sublet.
2.17 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such losses include costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are recognised as an expense as incurred.
No depreciation is charged on assets in the course of construction.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its estimated useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 2% per annum Short leasehold property over life of lease Motor vehicles 25% per annum Fixtures and fittings 14% per annum 1 Computer equipment 33 3% per annum The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
44 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 Accounting Policies continued An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are recognised within central costs, in the income statement.
2.18 Intangibles a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units monitored by management, at the segment level.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
b Other Intangibles Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Resident contracts three years The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
2.19 Employee Benefit Costs Staff costs comprise salaries, wages and pensions for the Groups staff as well as other staff costs.
The Group operates defined contribution pension plans, which are plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses as they fall due.
2.20 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where necessary, impairment is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
2.21 Taxation Including Deferred Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 45 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2007 2 Accounting Policies continued 2.21 Taxation Including Deferred Tax continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
2.22 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and balances in accounts at no or short notice.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities: however they are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
2.23 Finance Costs Financial costs include interest and amortisation of loan arrangement fees.
Loan arrangement fees are amortised evenly using the effective rate method.
2.24 Finance Income Finance income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
2.25 Receivables Trade receivables defined in accordance with IAS 39 are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method for any doubtful amounts.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Any other trade receivables are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts.
An allowance is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
2.26 Other Liabilities Other liabilities primarily comprise holiday pay liabilities, income taxes, other taxes and interest payable, which are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
Other liabilities also comprise the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
2.27 Government Grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred government grants and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.
2.28 Property Assets Held for Sale Property assets are freehold properties classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
2.29 Trade Payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.30 Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
46 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 Accounting Policies continued 2.31 Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.32 Dividend Distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys Shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys Shareholders.
2.33 Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, and others and they are summarised below.
2.34 Interest Rate Risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings which are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The Group aims to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rate movements by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed, where considered appropriate, through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
2.35 Fair Value Estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
The fair value of long-term borrowings approximate to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet, as the majority are fixed rate borrowings and interest rate fluctuations have been minimal during the period.
2.36 Liquidity Risk As regards liquidity, the policy of the Group has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short and long-term borrowings with shortterm flexibility achieved through overdraft facilities.
2.37 Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential residents before services commence.
3 Segmental Analysis At 30 September 2007, the Group has two identifiable business segments: Elderly Care and Specialist.
All operations of the Group are carried out in the United Kingdom and therefore no geographical segmentation is disclosed.
Consequently, the Group has considered business segmentation as the primary segmentation, with two reportable segments, Elderly Care and Specialist.
Revenue, earnings before taxation and total equity of the Group are wholly attributable to the operation of care homes and arise solely within the United Kingdom.

This has reduced the value of the Groups tax assets by 2.2m.
The tax charge is expected to be lower than the standard rate in future periods, as the impact of non-deductible intangibles and depreciation is expected to be outweighed by benefits from the use of tax assets, including brought-forward losses and capital allowance pools.

Additional disclosures are set out in the accounting policies relating to risk management.
In accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, management has reviewed contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
No such embedded derivatives were found.
Financial Instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies remained unchanged throughout the periods presented.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity Rate Risk As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the periods presented has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with a number of banks and institutions.

It is, in addition, the Groups policy to maintain borrowing facilities with a syndicate of banks.
Currency Risks The Group is based in the United Kingdom, with its operations entirely within the United Kingdom.
It does not hold any investment in overseas operations and consequently the balance sheet is not exposed to movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group does not have sales or purchase transactions in currencies other than the units functional currency and consequently does not have transactional currency exposures.

For floating rate bank loans, fair values closely approximate to book values.
The fair value of short-term loans and overdrafts approximate to the fair carrying value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of long-term borrowings approximate to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate.
