The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
The fair values of the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.
Book value Fair on value acquisition adjustments 2007 2006 m m m m Goodwill 101 101 102 Intangible assets 262 262 87 Property, plant and equipment 1 Current assets 77 9 Current liabilities 14 14 17 Deferred tax 2 35 37 11 Net assets acquired 9 328 319 171 Consideration after taking account of 11m net cash acquired 319 171 Less: consideration deferred to future years 26 22 Net cash flow 293 149 The fair value adjustments in relation to the acquisitions made in 2007 relate principally to the valuation of intangible assets.
Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including skilled workforces and acquisition synergies that are specific to Reed Elsevier.
In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The businesses acquired in 2007 contributed 51m to revenue, 17m to adjusted operating profit, increased net profit by 1m and contributed 1m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a proforma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit and net profit for the year would have been 4,592m, 1,138m and 1,202m respectively.
