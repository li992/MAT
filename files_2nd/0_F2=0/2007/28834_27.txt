Underwriting result and COR are the key internal measures of profitability of the operating segments.
The COR reflects the ratio of claims costs and expenses including commission to premiums, expressed as a percentage.
All of these items are measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Certain items included within the Groups investment result are allocated to the operating segments based on economic capital requirements.
Transfers or transactions between segments are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.
Amounts reported for the prior year have been restated to reflect the revised operating segments.
Management basis The management basis reflects the way management monitor the business.
Operating result on a management basis comprises the underwriting result, the investment result and other activities.
Major components of underwriting result are net earned premiums, other operating income, net claims and benefits and underwriting and policy acquisition costs.
The investment result, excluding unwind of discount and foreign exchange, is disclosed as net investment return on the statutory basis.
Investment income on the statutory basis includes an adjustment for depreciation on Group occupied properties.
Other activities primarily comprise administration and other expenses and investment expenses and charges.

These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Group Audit Committee.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate.
The discount rates used are pre tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.

During the year, Codan A S purchased 24m of its own shares on the market.
In addition, the Group launched a voluntary conditional public tender offer for the acquisition of all the outstanding issued shares and voting rights in Codan A S. As a result the Group acquired sufficient shareholding to effect a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares and, as the transaction is not reversible, to account for 100% of the subsidiary.
At 31 December 2007, the Group owned 99.5% of Codan A S and completed the compulsory acquisition process to acquire the remaining 0.5% in January 2008.
The two transactions reduced minority interests by 246m and shareholders funds by 368m.

Prior year development in 2007 showed favourable experience across all accident years and totalled 336m, net of reinsurance, which primarily comprises favourable development from the Groups UK specialist claims unit, as well as the cumulative impact of actions taken to reduce claims leakage in Other Europe.
On a discounted basis, prior year underwriting profit in 2007 was 348m, compared with 131m in 2006, which included 164m of reserve strengthening for Scandinavia personal accident and UK asbestos reserves.
The total discounting at the end of 2007 was 601m representing an increase of 29m in the year, due mostly to the impact of including the Adverse Development Cover ADC following the disposal of the US operation.
In Scandinavia certain long tail liabilities are settled by an annuity and the discounted value of these annuities is shown separately.

At 31 December 2006 the Group held 101m of deferred tax liability adjusted for 2m foreign exchange movement in 2007 in respect of these reserves.
During 2007 the Group acquired the minority interest in Codan A S. In light of this change in circumstance the Group has concluded that no tax base and associated temporary tax difference exists in respect of these reserves.
The deferred tax liability held at 31 December 2006 in respect of the Danish Security Fund and Swedish Safety Reserve has therefore been released in the period.
The deferred income tax credited charged to equity is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Fair value reserves in shareholders equity Available for sale financial assets 30 2 Group occupied property 4 2 Retirement benefit obligations 13 74 Share options 3 5 Reclassification of debt 4 2 Total credited charged to equity for the year 32 75 The aggregate current tax relating to items that were credited or charged to equity is 3m 2006: 8m.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 1,244m 2006: 653m and unused tax credits of 33m 2006: 30m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 2m 2006: 14m has been recognised in respect of losses included within other temporary differences at 31 December 2007.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1,237m 2006: 639m tax losses and unused tax credits of 33m 2006: 30m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 51m 2006: 39m which will expire by 2016.

Prior to the disposal of the US operation, the assets and liabilities arising from the ADC eliminated on consolidation.
As part of the disposal of the US operation, and as publicly disclosed in 2006, the original contract was amended and restated.
The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component of 0.1bn represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2007 is 0.4bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component is 0.4bn.
Following the signing of the amended and restated contract the accounting treatment has been reviewed: the insurance component is accounted for within insurance liabilities and the deposit component, offset by the value of the funds held in the trust account, is recognised under other liabilities.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 34m 2006: 30m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 23m were paid to this scheme during 2007 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2007, when the scheme funding rate was 132%.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries share of the total multi employer scheme was less than 15%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 are based on salaries in that year and are revalued up to retirement.
104 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 26.
Retirement benefit obligations continued In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder scheme.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2007 were 23% and 22% of pensionable salaries 2006: 23% and 21%.
Additional contributions totalling 86m 2006: 86m were made to the schemes, in accordance with the plan to reduce their funding deficits.
Expected contributions to pension and post retirement benefit schemes for the year ending 31 December 2008 are approximately 70m, including a further 37m of additional contributions.
The major defined benefit schemes are subject to regular valuation using the projected unit method which is the basis used to determine the pension cost in the consolidated income statement.
Independent, qualified actuaries carry out valuations of the major defined benefit schemes for the purposes of assessing pension costs.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.
Benefits are generally payable for life.
The estimated discounted present values of the unfunded accumulated obligations are calculated in accordance with the advice of independent, qualified actuaries.

The expected return on schemes assets are determined for each asset class by considering both market conditions at the opening balance sheet date and any expectations for longer term changes in current returns.
All returns are net of investment expenses.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables for males and females respectively, with age ratings to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for using the medium cohort projection and using the projected mortality rates applicable to calendar year 2014 for current pensioners and 2032 for future pensioners.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 25.8 years males and 27.0 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 has a future lifetime of 27.2 years males and 28.2 years females.
Commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes has changed its rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
The commutation factors are broadly cost neutral i. e. when valued on the IAS 19 basis, the amount of cash taken is approximately equal to the value of the pension being given up.
For this reason there is no change made to previous practice whereby the accounting valuation makes no allowance for commutations.
Post retirement medical benefits The valuation of liabilities for post retirement liabilities in Canada assumes 10% decreasing to 5% in 10 years for drugs 2006: 9% decreasing to 5% in eight years, 4% 2006: 4% for hospitals and 3% 2006: 3% for other.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, the assumed inflation rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligations in the UK by 79m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK by 69m.
An increase of one year in life expectancy would increase the defined benefit obligations by approximately 151m.

Share based compensation The Group has four types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Executive Share Option Scheme: the Sharesave Plan: the Share Matching Plan: and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within Association of British Insurers limits.
The total employment cost recorded in the income statement for all plans was 19m in 2007 2006: 13m.
These costs include the costs associated with plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares for awards that have been granted after 7 November 2002.
The value of equity settled awards granted prior to this date has been excluded in accordance with the transitional provisions contained in IFRS 2 Share Based Payment.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, which provides options to purchase ordinary shares to officers and other key employees at prices not less than the fair value of the ordinary shares at the date of grant.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme are described on page 54.
The exercise price of all options is the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options expire 10 years after the date of the grant.

The weighted average share price on the dates the options were exercised in 2007 was 152.06p 2006: 149.14p.
Sharesave Plan Under the Groups Sharesave Plan savings related eligible employees can receive options to purchase ordinary shares at a price equal to 80% of the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options vest either three or five years from the grant date and expire six months after vesting.
The number of shares available for purchase from the plan by each participant is limited to the whole number of shares purchasable from the aggregate value of the individuals savings contract upon maturity.
An individuals maximum monthly contribution to all current savings contracts is 250.

The fair value of share options granted under the Sharesave Plan during 2007 was 8m 2006: 4m.
The weighted average share price on the dates the options were exercised in 2007 was 150.57p 2006: 143.42p.
Fair values for the options granted under the Sharesave Plan were estimated as of the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yields of 4.0% 2006: 3.5% : expected volatilities of 30% 2006: 35% : ordinary share price of 142.90p 2006: 138.51p : risk free interest rates of 5.0% 2006: 4.8% : and expected terms equal to the vesting terms of three or five years.
An estimate based on past experience is made of the number of forfeitures during the vesting period due to employees leaving the Group.
The expected volatility is determined by reference to the actual volatility of the share price over the appropriate term ending on the grant date.
Share Matching Plan The Groups Share Matching Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2004 AGM.
Awards were made during 2004 and 2005.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Share Matching Plan are described in the footnote to the long term incentive schemes table audited part on page 55.
Under the plan, Deferred Share awards granted are held in trust for three years and are normally forfeited upon an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
Participants may also receive Matching Share awards up to a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded.
Matching Share awards are subject to the achievement of total shareholder return targets over a single two year period, with performance measured by comparison against other UK listed companies.
Matching Share awards vest with the Deferred Share awards on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Further information on the Share Matching Plan may be found in the footnote to the long term incentive schemes table audited part on page 55.

It is subject to the same criteria as all the other grants made in 2005.
Under the Share Matching Plan there were no awards granted in 2007.
In 2006 the fair value of each Deferred Share award granted by the Parent Company was 114.40p and the fair value of each potential Matching Share award was 38.10p.
The total fair value of the awards granted under the plan during 2006 was nil.
The fair value of the Deferred Share awards was calculated based upon the ordinary share price at grant date after deducting from it the estimated value of the dividends that will not be received during the vesting period.
The fair value of the potential Matching Share awards was estimated by calculating the expected value arising from modelling the awards that would arise under different performance scenarios.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2006 AGM.
Awards were made during 2006 and 2007 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years and Compulsory Deferred Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntary and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2.5:1.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives, and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Further information on the Long Term Incentive Plan may be found outside these financial statements in the remuneration report.
The fair value of each Voluntary Deferred Share award was nil 2006: nil and the fair value of each potential associated Matching Share was 164.00p 2006: 126.00p.
The fair value of each Compulsory Deferred Share award was 164.00p 2006: 127.00p and the fair value of each potential associated Matching Share was 113.50p 2006: 87.85p.
The fair value of each Performance Share award granted was 112.07p 2006: 88.71p.
The total fair value of the awards granted under the plan in 2007 was 24m 2006: 18m.
Fair values of the awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan scheme during 2007 are taken to be the share price on the day preceding the grant date, except for the Restricted Shares where the share price is reduced by an estimate of the value of dividends that will not be received.
A dividend yield of 4.0% 2006: 3.5% was assumed.
Market related performance criteria were based on an arithmetic mean estimate of performance against a specified group of 13 competitors and it is assumed that all non market related performance criteria would be met such that all awards would be exercisable.
Other share based payments Certain employees of the Groups former US operation held entitlements under the Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees prior to the disposal of the operation.
On disposal of the US operation the options under the scheme became cash settled and the majority of the options vested.
There are also other plans under which awards have been granted to certain employees in the form of cash settled share based awards.
Under these plans, if the vesting conditions are satisfied, cash awards are made based upon the underlying performance of the Parent Companys ordinary shares.
Awards were made in 1999 and 2001 under old schemes and during 2004 and 2005 on terms that provide the same potential benefits as the Share Matching Plan.
The liability in respect of these plans at 31 December 2007 was 4m 2006: 2m.
The intrinsic value of awards that had vested at 31 December 2007 was 4m 2006: nil.
Hedge accounting At 1 January 2005 the Group designated the loan capital denominated in Euros as a hedging instrument against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk exposure.
The book value of the hedging instrument at 31 December 2007 was 365m 2006: 335m.
The fair value of the hedging instrument at 31 December 2007 was 377m 2006: 353m.
The hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement during 2007 is nil 2006: nil.
During 2007 the Group designated certain forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce further the foreign currency exchange risk exposure.
On designation, the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
The fair value of the hedging instruments at 31 December 2007 is a liability of 26m 2006: nil.
Further information on derivatives, including those designated as hedging instruments, can be found in the risk management section.

100% direct subsidiary of Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group plc.
In addition the Group launched a voluntary conditional public tender offer for the acquisition of all the outstanding issued shares and voting rights in Codan A S. As a result the Group acquired sufficient shareholding to effect a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares and, as the transaction is not reversible, to account for 100% of the subsidiary.
At 31 December 2007 the Group owned 99.5% of Codan A S and completed the compulsory acquisition process to acquire the remaining 0.5% in January 2008.
Except where indicated all holdings are of equity shares and represent 100% of the nominal issued capital.
In all cases the proportion of voting power held equals the proportion of ownership interest.
Some subsidiaries have been omitted from this statement to avoid providing particulars of excessive length but none materially affects the results or assets of the Group.

On 31 October 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Thomson Jemmett Vogelzang.
On 31 December 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company CNS.
All acquisitions were in Canada.
The total consideration was 61m and goodwill of 23m arose on acquisitions.
m Intangible assets excluding goodwill 45 Investments 60 Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities 25 Other assets 25 Cash and cash equivalents 9 Insurance contract liabilities 90 Other liabilities 36 Net assets 38 Cash consideration including acquisition costs 61 Goodwill on acquisitions 23 If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2007, Group net written premiums for the year would have increased by 52m and the Groups profit after tax would have increased by 4m.
The total profit after tax of the acquired entities since the acquisition dates included in the Groups profit for the period is 1m.
Goodwill is individually assessed on each acquisition.
The goodwill shown above arose from the premium paid for strengthening the Groups market position in targeted business segments and acquiring the skilled workforce to drive future profitability in those segments.
Goodwill also represents the future cost saving from expected synergies and economies of scale.
The valuation of CNS is provisional as the purchase completed at the end of the financial year.
Disposal of subsidiaries During the year disposals of subsidiary undertakings and books of business were made for total proceeds of 8m, giving rise to a pre tax loss of 35m.
Group disposals during the year comprise: The disposal of its US operation on 4 March 2007.
The net cost of the transaction was nil and generated a pre tax loss of 19m.
This represents foreign exchange, which is recycled from shareholders funds and does not impact total equity.
In 2006 the loss recognised as a result of remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell was 399m.
The disposal of its Venezuelan business on 14 December 2007.
The transaction generated proceeds, net of costs, of nil and generated a pre tax loss of 13m which comprises a 5m loss on net asset value and 8m of foreign exchange, which is recycled from shareholders funds and does not impact total equity.
