Additional contributions of around 26m will also be made in 2008 in respect of the deficit in the schemes.
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to apply the average of the yields on those AA corporate bonds which most closely approximate to the timescale of the liability profile of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 5.8%, in respect of the UK schemes at 31 December 2007 5.2% at 31 December 2006.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 26m.
Liability calculations are also heavily impacted by the mortality projections included in the actuarial assumptions.
The weighted average life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 has been assumed as 19.6 years.
The weighted average life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52 has been assumed as 20.4 years.
The directors consider, on actuarial advice, these assumptions to be appropriate to the profile of the membership of the schemes.
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 49m.
Pension obligations in respect of deferred members increase in line with inflation.
Increases in salaries and increases in pensions-in-payment generally move in line with inflation.
Inflation is therefore an important assumption in the calculation of defined retirement benefit liabilities.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the rate of inflation assumption applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 14m.

Restructuring Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued operations.
Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
