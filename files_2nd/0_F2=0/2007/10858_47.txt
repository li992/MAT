88 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups multi-national operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most material of which are the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes in fuel prices.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of these risks on the financial performance of the Group by using financial instruments including borrowings, forward exchange contracts, fuel price and interest rate swaps.
The Board of Directors have delegated to a sub-committee, the Treasury committee, the responsibility for implementing the risk management policies laid down by the Board.
The policies are implemented by the central treasury department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk including the use of financial instruments.
Foreign currency The Group has major operations in the US, Canada, Spain and residual assets in Australia and as a result is exposed to foreign exchange risks on translation of net assets and on earnings denominated in foreign currency.
The Group finances overseas investments mainly through the use of foreign currency borrowings to hedge the net asset investment.
The Group has also entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its overseas subsidiaries.
These have the effect of increasing foreign currency denominated debt and reducing sterling debt.
The forward exchange contract terms run for periods up to one year.
The Group has a policy of hedging between 50% and 100% foreign currency denominated net assets.
At 31 December 2007 81% 2006: 78% of the Groups exposure to US dollar assets were hedged, 71% 2006: 92% of the exposure to Canadian dollar assets, nil% 2006: 89% of the exposure to Australian dollar assets and 97% 2006: 94% of the exposure to Euro assets.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in foreign currency exchange rates, with all other variables held constant.
This would affect the Groups profit before tax and translation reserve.
The effect on the translation reserve represents the movement in the translated value of the foreign currency denominated loans and forward contracts.
These movements would be offset by a corresponding movement in the translated value of the Groups overseas net investments.

It is the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide certainty as to the level of interest expense in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term.
Interest on the Groups floating interest rate debt is based on LIBOR or EURIBOR and, to achieve the above objectives, the Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
The net effect of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2007 the Group was hedged against interest rate movements on 731.5m 2006: 345.6m of gross debt for an average of 3.0 2006: 2.8 years.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax and on the Groups hedging reserve.
The effect on profit before tax arises through movements in interest on floating rate financial instruments.
The effect on the hedging reserve represents the movement in the fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps.
The sensitivity analysis covers all floating rate financial instruments, including the interest rate swaps.

It is the Groups policy to hedge this exposure in order to provide certainty as to the level of costs in the short-term and to reduce the year on year impact of price fluctuations over the medium term.
This is achieved by entering into fuel swaps and purchase contracts which are expected to be highly effective.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had hedged approximately 58% of its 2008 expected usage and 31% of its 2009 expected usage.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax and on the Groups hedging reserve.
The sensitivity analysis includes all fuel price swaps.
The effect on the hedging reserve arises through movements on the fair value of the Groups fuel price swaps.

This risk is mitigated by a number of factors.
The majority of the Groups receivables are public or quasi-public bodies, both national DfT Rail and Network Rail in the UK and local school boards in North America, municipal authorities in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, Transport for London and Centro in the UK.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to pose a significant credit risk.
Outside of this the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The counterparties for financial assets other than investments and trade receivables are subject to pre-approval by the Treasury committee and such approval is limited to financial institutions with an A rating or better.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the Treasury committee.
The only element of the Groups financial assets which are not impaired but are past due are certain trade receivable items.
