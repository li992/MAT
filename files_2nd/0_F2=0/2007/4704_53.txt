Diageo Annual Report 2007 123 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles Diageo plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and the groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
IFRS as adopted by the EU also differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The differences between IFRS and US GAAP, in respect of net income and shareholders equity, are set out below: Effect on net income of differences between IFRS and US GAAP: 2007 2006 2005 Notes million million million Net income attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company in accordance with IFRS 1,489 1,908 1,344 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Inventories and land and buildings a 20 24 24 Intangibles b 6 6 2 Pensions and other post employment benefits c 130 96 6 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares d 27 Financial instruments e 78 31 46 Intercompany balances f 30 1 14 Mot Hennessy g 5 7 16 Disposal of General Mills shares h 92 160 Disposal of tangible fixed assets and businesses i 9 1 5 Burger King j 18 17 Employee share options k 3 2 9 Other items 10 3 29 Deferred taxation l on above adjustments 26 53 36 other 132 181 277 Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,592 1,429 1,470 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax k 2 Net income in accordance with US GAAP 1,592 1,427 1,470 Earnings per ordinary share in accordance with US GAAP m Basic earnings per ordinary share Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 59.2p 50.3p 49.5p Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 0.1 p Net income 59.2p 50.2p 49.5p Diluted earnings per ordinary share Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 58.8p 50.1p 49.4p Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 0.1 p Net income 58.8p 50.0p 49.4p Basic earnings per ADS after cumulative effect of accounting change 236.8p 200.8p 198.0p Diluted earnings per ADS after cumulative effect of accounting change 235.2p 200.0p 197.6p 124 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Cumulative effect on shareholders equity of differences between IFRS and US GAAP: 30 June 30 June 2007 2006 Notes million million Equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company in accordance with IFRS 3,972 4,502 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Inventories and land and buildings a 115 144 Brands a, b 3,061 3,084 Goodwill a, b 3,163 3,201 Other intangibles a, b 4 16 Pensions and other post employment benefits c 18 648 Financial instruments e 4 17 Mot Hennessy g 308 322 Employee share options k 6 8 Other items 3 14 Deferred taxation l on above adjustments 1,244 1,380 other 855 990 Shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP 8,535 9,508 A description of accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP that are material to the group is set out below.
a Accounting for the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the group has opted not to restate the accounting for business combinations that occurred prior to the date of transition to IFRS 1 July 2004 from that previously applied under UK GAAP.
In the groups primary financial statements, the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group has therefore been accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests, where the results, cash flows and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under US GAAP, the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet with an effective acquisition date of 31 December 1997.
Consequently the Guinness Groups assets and liabilities, including land and buildings, were recorded at fair values on 31 December 1997.
Under US GAAP, the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets has been allocated firstly to identifiable intangible assets, including brands, based on their fair values, with the remainder allocated to goodwill.
Fair value adjustments to the recorded amounts of inventories, net of deferred tax, are expensed in the period in which the inventory is sold.
b Brands, goodwill and other intangibles Under both IFRS and US GAAP, significant owned brands acquired by the group are recorded on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the group has written off goodwill and other intangible assets acquired up to 30 June 1998 direct to reserves in the period when acquired.
All intangible assets acquired from 1 July 1998 have been capitalised in the balance sheet.
Capitalised goodwill and other intangibles, apart from brands, acquired between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 2004 were amortised over their useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.
From the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill and brands are not amortised but are subject to impairment tests at least annually.
Under US GAAP, up to 30 June 2001, intangible assets have been capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised through the statement of income over their useful economic lives, not exceeding 40 years.
On 1 July 2001, the group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and ceased to amortise goodwill and brands from this date.
Instead goodwill and brands have been subject to impairment tests at least annually, as under IFRS.
c Pensions and other post employment benefits There are a number of significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP in accounting for pension and other post employment benefit costs that have an impact on the group: i Under IFRS, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using the fair value of assets are charged credited to other finance income in the income statement.
The group has taken the option permitted under IFRS to include any amount arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the period and those at the end of the period, and any differences between the actual and expected returns on the plans assets, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost, the interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using a smoothed market value of assets are all charged credited to operating income.
The cumulative amounts arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the period and those at the end of the period, and any differences between the actual and expected returns on the plans assets, are amortised through operating income over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
As there was an unrecognised loss under US GAAP at 30 June 2006, this led to an additional charge to operating income for the year ended 30 June 2007 of 95 million 2006 96 million: 2005 26 million under US GAAP compared with IFRS.
ii The expected return on assets for the period is calculated using the fair value of assets under IFRS, but is calculated using a smoothed fair value of assets under US GAAP.
This smoothing can lead to differences in the amount included in the statement of income from the expected return on investments in the pension funds.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, the income was 324 million 2006 275 million: 2005 280 million under IFRS, whereas it was 304 million 2006 298 million: 2005 347 million under US GAAP.
This amount is included in other finance income under IFRS, but in operating income under US GAAP.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 125 iii Under IFRS, gains from curtailments are recognised immediately as a credit to the income statement, but under US GAAP, where net losses not previously recognised in the income statement exceed curtailment gains, the net loss is spread through the income statement over the average remaining service lives of the active members.
In addition under US GAAP, any prior service cost not previously recognised in the income statement in respect of members involved in the curtailment must be recognised immediately as a charge to operating income.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, this led to an additional charge to the income statement of 5 million 2005 40 million under US GAAP compared with IFRS.
iv There are some historical losses from past service costs that were not recognised immediately as a charge to operating income under US GAAP.
These losses are amortised over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, this led to an additional charge to operating income of 15 million 2006 15 million: 2005 17 million under US GAAP compared with IFRS.
v Under IFRS, the surplus or deficit in post employment plans at the balance sheet date is reported as part of the groups consolidated net assets.
On 30 June 2007, the group adopted SFAS No.
158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans for US GAAP reporting.
158, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the plan is recognised as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognised through other comprehensive income.
158 has eliminated the difference in shareholders equity under IFRS and US GAAP, apart from if the post employment plan is in surplus.
Under IFRS, the amount recognised is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds or future contribution reductions, plus unrecognised actuarial losses and unrecognised past service costs, whereas under US GAAP there is no such restriction.
Retrospective application of SFAS No.
158 is not permitted and, at 30 June 2006, postretirement plans were accounted for under SFAS Nos.
87 and 106, only when the plan was in deficit, calculated on the plans accrued rather than projected liabilities, was the difference between the plan assets and liabilities included in the groups consolidated net assets, with changes in the funded status recognised through other comprehensive income.
If the plan was in surplus, the groups consolidated net assets included a prepayment or provision which was the difference between the cumulative charges to operating income and the cumulative cash contributions made to the plan.
d Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares Under IFRS prior to 30 June 2005, the premium received from the sale to General Mills of options over 29 million ordinary shares of Diageos holding in that company was deferred in the balance sheet pending exercise or lapse of the options.
On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the options were exercisable were disposed of to the groups UK pension fund.
The premium in respect of the option over the 4 million shares was realised in the statement of income in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Under US GAAP, the option contracts represented derivatives and, accordingly, were held at their estimated fair values at the balance sheet dates, with changes in fair value included in the statement of income.
From 1 July 2005, following the adoption of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, under both IFRS and US GAAP, any changes in fair value of the options have been included in the statement of income.
The options over the remaining 25 million ordinary shares expired in October 2005 and resulted in a gain of 8 million for the year ended 30 June 2006 under both IFRS and US GAAP.
e Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Under IFRS, prior to the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 July 2005, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecast transactions were not recognised until realised.
Since 1 July 2005, all such derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, prior to 1 July 2005, for derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations in respect of foreign exchange differences arising on translation to closing rates, changes in their fair value were taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
Under US GAAP, all derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Certain of the groups derivatives qualified for and are designated as hedges under US GAAP.
Gains and losses that arose from changes in the fair value of derivatives, and gains and losses that arose from changes in the fair value of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, were charged or credited in determining net income under US GAAP.
From 1 July 2005, there are differences between IFRS and US GAAP in respect of the following items: i For interest rate hedging, there are differences between hedge designation, effectiveness testing methods and IAS 39 transition requirements which result in: a some derivatives not being designated as hedges under US GAAP: b a lower level of ineffectiveness arising on those derivatives which can be designated as hedges under US GAAP: and c an adjustment being made to the hedged item for fair value hedges at transition to IAS 39 which is not made under US GAAP.
As a result, under US GAAP, for the year ended 30 June 2007 this led to an additional credit to net interest of 12 million 2006 19 million charge as compared with IFRS.
ii For cash flow hedging, at transition to IAS 39 all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are considered as hedges prior to the transition date, while for US GAAP the hedge relationship starts from the time the hedge is documented, which in certain cases is the date that IAS 39 was first adopted.
Therefore there are differences with respect to the amounts recognised in the hedging reserves and the amount recycled to the income statement at the time the hedged item matures.
As a result, under US GAAP, for the year ended 30 June 2007 this led to an additional credit to operating income of 9 million 2006 13 million as compared with IFRS.
iii For net investment hedging, there are differences between hedge designation and effectiveness testing requirements, and some loans and derivatives that are designated as hedges under IFRS are not designated as hedges under US GAAP.
As a result, under US GAAP, for the year ended 30 June 2007 this led to an additional credit to net finance charges of 57 million 2006 25 million charge as compared with IFRS.
f Intercompany balances Under IFRS and US GAAP, exchange differences arising on long term intercompany balances, for which settlement is not planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are generally included as equity movements.
However, under US GAAP, there is a restriction whereby one of the companies with the intercompany balance must have the same functional currency as the common parent company, and there must be no intermediate parent company with a different functional currency.
Otherwise any exchange differences arising are taken to net income.
126 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued g Mot Hennessy The operations of Mot Hennessy are conducted both through a partnership and through a limited company in which the group has 34% interests.
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the investments in Mot Hennessy are accounted for using the equity method of accounting but, as a result of applying accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP, primarily in respect of accounting for the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group referred to in a above, the groups share of the carrying values of the investments are different under IFRS and US GAAP.
The groups share of net income from Mot Hennessy is different between IFRS and US GAAP primarily in respect of accounting differences on fair value accounting for vines and grapes.
h Disposal of General Mills shares Applying the accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP resulted in different carrying values for the shares held in General Mills.
As a consequence of these different values, different gains arose on the subsequent disposals of the shares in October 2004 and November 2005.
Under IFRS, the investment in General Mills was classified as a non-current investment for the year ended 30 June 2005 at deemed cost and, on the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 July 2005, was reclassified as an available for sale security.
Under US GAAP, the investment was held from 1 July 2004 as an available for sale security.
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, available for sale securities are held on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value included in equity.
On the disposal of the shares in General Mills, the amount included in equity in respect of the shares disposed of, representing the cumulative change in fair value, was included in net income.
i Disposal of tangible fixed assets and businesses Applying the accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP can result in changes to the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities.
As a consequence of these different carrying values, including related tax balances, different gains or losses may arise on the subsequent disposal of the assets.
In addition, the timing of the recognition of a loss on a disposal may be different under IFRS and US GAAP.
j Burger King Under IFRS, the sale of Burger King on 13 December 2002 the completion date was accounted for as a disposal in the year ended 30 June 2003, and interest receivable on the subordinated debt was included in interest income in the period to which it related.
Under US GAAP, the transaction was not accounted for as a disposal in the year ended 30 June 2003 due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continued involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
Under US GAAP, following the completion date, Diageo did not recognise profits of Burger King, nor interest receivable on the subordinated debt due from Burger King, in its income statement but, generally, reflected losses as an impairment charge against the assets retained in the balance sheet.
On 13 July 2005, Burger King refinanced its external borrowings on a stand-alone basis, resulting in the release of Diageo from its obligations under the guarantee and the receipt by Diageo of amounts owed in respect of the subordinated debt and cumulative interest.
As a consequence, under US GAAP, Burger King was accounted for as a disposal in the year ended 30 June 2006 and the cumulative deferred interest and cumulative translation adjustment in respect of Burger King were recognised in the income statement.
k Employee share options From 1 July 2005, Diageo adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
123 R Share-Based Payment for its US GAAP reporting.
As a consequence, for the two years ended 30 June 2007, the accounting treatment for equity classified employee stock options was the same under both IFRS and US GAAP.
US GAAP has more stringent criteria than IFRS for determining whether a plan is classified as an equity or liability plan.
Liability classified awards are re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled, whereas equity classified awards are measured at grant date fair value and are not subsequently re-measured.
Diageos senior executive share option plan SESOP is accounted for as a liability plan under US GAAP, whereas under IFRS it is treated as an equity plan.
123 R on 1 July 2005, Diageo revalued unvested awards in the SESOP plan and recognised a charge of 2 million net of tax in respect of the cumulative effect of the accounting change.
For the year ended 30 June 2005, under US GAAP, the group accounted for employee share options in compliance with APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees which differs in certain respects from IFRS.
Under APB 25, compensation cost for fixed awards being awards under which both the exercise price and the number of ordinary shares are fixed is determined as the difference between the fair value of the ordinary shares at the date of the award and the amount the employee has to pay for the ordinary shares.
Compensation cost for variable awards including awards subject to future performance conditions is measured as the difference between the market price at the period end and the exercise price and is based on the number of awards expected to vest.
l Deferred taxation IFRS requires deferred tax to be recognised, with limited exceptions, in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax written down value of assets and liabilities and the book value, including temporary differences arising as a result of intra group transactions.
Similarly US GAAP requires deferred tax to be recognised, with limited exceptions, for taxable temporary differences but, where assets or liabilities are transferred within a group, no deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of changes in tax written down values.
IFRS and US GAAP require deferred tax liabilities to be set up for all assets separately identified, where there are temporary differences, including brands, but excluding goodwill not deductible for tax, recognised on a business combination.
As the combination of GrandMet and the Guinness Group was accounted for as a merger under IFRS but as an acquisition under US GAAP, as referred to in a above, deferred tax liabilities arose in respect of the additional acquired brand values.
In addition, under IFRS, deferred tax is based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date.
For US GAAP, only tax rates and laws that have been enacted are taken into account.
Other differences exist between IFRS and US GAAP, including differences in respect of share options and profit on the intra group sale of inventories.
IFRS requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be disclosed as non-current items on the balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified between current and non-current depending on the items to which they relate or, where there is no underlying item, the period in which they are expected to reverse.
m Earnings per ordinary share Under IFRS and US GAAP, the calculation of earnings per ordinary share is generally consistent and is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Earnings per American Depositary Share are calculated on the basis of one American Depositary Share representing four ordinary shares.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 127 n Variable interest entitles US GAAP requires the results, assets and liabilities of variable interest entities to be consolidated if the group is regarded as the primary beneficiary.
The primary beneficiary is generally defined as the party whose variable interests absorb the majority of the expected losses or residual returns of the variable interest entity.
The group has a number of joint arrangements with Mot Hennessy in France and the Far East, involved in the marketing and distribution of the groups and Mot Hennessys premium drinks, where the group is regarded as the primary beneficiary, which have been consolidated.
Under IFRS, the group only consolidates the attributable share of the results, assets and liabilities of the joint arrangements measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, the consolidation of variable interest entities under US GAAP increased sales by 500 million 2006 437 million: 2005 303 million and operating income by 44 million 2006 38 million: 2005 25 million as compared with IFRS.
This accounting difference has no effect on US GAAP net income or shareholders equity as compared with IFRS.
o Basis of consolidation The group has interests in a number of other jointly controlled entities.
Under IFRS, the group reports its interest in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation.
The groups share of the assets, liabilities, sales, income and cash flows of jointly controlled entities are included in the appropriate categories of the groups financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Under US GAAP, these interests are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the groups share of the net income and net assets of the jointly controlled entities are reported as one line in the income statement and balance sheet.
Applying the equity method of accounting under US GAAP for the year ended 30 June 2007 decreased sales by 128 million 2006 110 million: 2005 100 million and operating income by 17 million 2006 19 million: 2005 16 million as compared with IFRS.
p Discontinued operations Under IFRS, the original disposals of Burger King and Pillsbury met the conditions for separate disclosure as discontinued operations.
Under US GAAP, due to Diageos continuing involvement in Burger King at the date of disposal through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance, and in Pillsbury due to the shareholding in General Mills, these disposals did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.
In the year ended 30 June 2007, a tax benefit of 82 million arose from the recognition of capital losses arising on the prior year disposals of Pillsbury and Burger King, and a tax credit of 57 million arose following resolution with tax authorities of various audit issues 2005 20 million tax credit in respect of the Pillsbury disposal.
In the year ended 30 June 2005, the group released a provision of 53 million in respect of the disposal of Burger King.
Under IFRS, the disposal of Burger King and the tax credits arising from the disposal of Pillsbury and Burger King have been classified in discontinued operations, consistent with the accounting for the original disposals.
These transactions have been included in continuing operations or have been deferred under US GAAP.
US GAAP statements of income for the three years ended 30 June 2007 are set out below: 2007 2006 2005 million million million Sales 10,289 10,031 9,170 Excise duties 2,424 2,431 2,272 Net sales 7,865 7,600 6,898 Cost of sales 3,314 3,248 2,834 Gross profit 4,551 4,352 4,064 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,546 2,408 2,235 Seagram integration 30 Thalidomide provision 121 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares 30 27 Burger King 21 53 Disposal of other businesses 1 2 2 Other operating income 60 5 12 Operating income 2,064 1,942 1,768 Disposal of General Mills shares 89 61 Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates net of tax 201 177 150 Investment income 5 17 Interest expense and other finance charges 351 263 205 Interest income and other finance income 211 23 60 Income before income taxes 2,125 1,973 1,851 Income taxes 434 462 313 Minority interest charges 99 82 68 Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,592 1,429 1,470 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 2 Net income after cumulative effect of accounting change 1,592 1,427 1,470 Excise duties comprise 463 million 2006 468 million: 2005 417 million of duties charged as tax on sales and 1,961 million 2006 1,963 million: 2005 1,855 million of duties charged as production and importation taxes.
Research and development expenditure was written off to selling, general and administrative expenses in the year in which it was incurred.
A taxation charge of 42 million 2006 39 million: 2005 41 million in respect of the Mot Hennessy partnership is included in income taxes under US GAAP and in share of associates profits after tax under IFRS.
128 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Statement of comprehensive income under US GAAP Under IFRS, the group presents a consolidated statement of recognised income and expense which is similar to a statement of comprehensive income required by US GAAP.
Comprehensive income, under US GAAP, for the three years ended 30 June 2007 is as follows: 2007 Before tax Tax Net million million million Net income 2,026 434 1,592 Exchange differences 215 17 198 Changes in fair value of cash flow hedges 54 12 42 Minimum pension liabilities 380 113 267 Comprehensive income 2,245 542 1,703 2006 2005 Before tax Tax Net Before tax Tax Net million million million million million million Net income 1,889 462 1,427 1,783 313 1,470 Exchange differences and changes in fair value of hedges 32 18 14 185 185 Holding gains on available for sale securities unrealised gains losses arising during the year 33 33 80 80 realised gains reclassified to net income 106 106 117 117 Minimum pension liabilities 685 120 565 361 33 328 Comprehensive income 2,533 600 1,933 1,410 280 1,130 Movements in US GAAP shareholders equity 2007 2006 2005 million million million Shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP at beginning of the year 9,508 9,853 10,287 Net income 1,592 1,427 1,470 Minimum pension liabilities net of tax 267 565 328 Net loss upon adoption of SFAS No.

US GAAP cash flows The groups consolidated financial statements include a consolidated cash flow statement in accordance with IAS 7 Cash flow statements.
The objective and principles of IAS 7 are similar to those set out in the US accounting standard SFAS No.
However, under IAS 7, cash for the purposes of the cash flow statement includes bank overdrafts.
Under US GAAP, bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings and the movements thereon are included in financing activities.

142 and ceased to amortise goodwill from this date.
The standard directs that goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment rather than being subject to amortisation.
The group conducts annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the level of the reporting units which make up each operating segment.
Potential impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair value.
Fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology and estimates regarding future growth.
These cash flows are discounted at the rate estimated by management to be the weighted average cost of capital for each particular reporting unit.
The estimates are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of the long term planning process.

123 R Share-Based Payment using the modified prospective transition method.
Under this method, compensation expense, determined using the fair value of the underlying option or share, is charged to the income statement for new grants made in the year and any unvested grants made in prior years.
Compensation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the share option or grant.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, this resulted in a charge of 23 million 2006 23 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses and 5 million 2006 5 million in cost of goods sold.
In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the US GAAP financial information for the year ended 30 June 2005 has not been restated.
At 30 June 2007, there was 34 million 2006 34 million of unrecognised compensation cost in respect of non vested share-based compensation granted under the various share option and share award plans.
The cost is expected to be recognised over a weighted average period of two years.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, the cash received from employees in respect of the exercise of options was 74 million 2006 69 million: 2005 69 million.
All share option schemes, with the exception of SESOP, are equity-classified awards under SFAS No.

The plans are generally of the defined benefit type.
The significant plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada.
The principal plans are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
Contributions are made by the group, on actuarial advice, to provide assets sufficient to cover the benefit entitlements of plan participants.
Generally, benefits are based on a formula recognising length of service and earnings close to retirement.
The group also operates a number of plans which provide employees with postretirement insurance.
The plans are generally unfunded.
The liability in respect of these benefits is assessed by qualified independent actuaries under the projected unit method and is included in other long term liabilities.
For all pension and other postretirement benefits, the measurement dates used to calculate the figures in the US GAAP financial information are the appropriate balance sheet dates.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the groups pension and other postretirement benefit plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the net periodic costs for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June: US plans Non-US plans 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 % % % % % % Rate of general increase in salaries 3.3 3.4 3.0 4.2 3.9 3.9 Discount rate for plan liabilities 6.2 6.3 5.0 5.7 5.1 4.7 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 7.4 7.4 6.5 7.2 7.3 6.9 For the UK and US plans, there are, in addition to the above percentages, age related promotional salary increases.
The weighted average medical inflation for beneficiaries is 10% reducing by 0.5% per year to 5% 2006 9% reducing by 1% per year to 5%: 2005 10% reducing by 1% per year to 5%.

155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements Nos.
133 and 140 In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
This statement provides a fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation, and requires that beneficial interests in securitised financial assets be analysed to determine whether they are free standing derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation.
155 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 September 2006.
155 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
157 Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
157 addresses standardising the measurement of fair value for companies that are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes.
The FASB defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
157 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 November 2007, and interim periods within those financial years.
157 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
