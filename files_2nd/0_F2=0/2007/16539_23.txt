Company Accounting Policies The Vedanta Resources plc the Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles and UK company law UK GAAP.
The financial information has been prepared on an historical cost basis.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year.
Significant Accounting Policies investments in Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries valued at cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
investment in Preference Phares of Subsidiaries Investments in preference shares of subsidiaries are stated at fair value.
The fair value is represented by the face value of the preference shares as the investments are redeemable at any time for their face value at the option of the Company.
currency translation Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, being US dollars, are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-Based Payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Amounts recharged to subsidiaries in respect of awards granted to employees of subsidiaries are recognised as intercompany debtor until repaid.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans are recorded at the net proceeds received i. e. net of direct transaction costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial instruments The Company has elected to take the exemption provided in paragraph 3C b of FRS 25 in respect of these parent company financial statements.
Full disclosures are provided in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2007. derivative Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account.
The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the profit and loss account and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
