Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 11 on pages 83 to 85.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred between 2008 and 2014.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
