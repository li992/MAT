The goodwill acquisitions in the prior year arose on the acquisition of the Spirit group.
The provisional fair values on the acquisition of the Spirit group have been finalised in the current year, resulting in additional goodwill of 34.4m note 29.
The goodwill at 19 August 2006 has been restated to reflect this.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units CGUs based on the benefits to the Group which arise from each business combination.
The two groups of CGUs are identified by their pub operating format leased or managed and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
The value of the goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of the CGUs to the carrying value of their goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations.
At 18 August 2007 the goodwill assigned to the leased estate is 364.6m August 2006: 268.7m and the goodwill assigned to the managed estate is 191.6m August 2006: 269.1m.
Value-in-use is calculated using five year financial forecasts.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.25% growth rate August 2006: 2.25% for the remaining useful life of the CGUs.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the market and is in line with the UKs post-war average growth rate.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8% August 2006: 8%.
Included within operating leases are properties with a net book value of 151.5m August 2006: 156.4m over which the Groups borrowings are secured by way of fixed and floating charges.
