Capital management The Groups financing strategy is based around its developer and co-investing manager business model, which allows capital from stabilised developments sold to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund to be recycled into new schemes.
The Board has adopted this business model to achieve an appropriate balance between the capital deployed in mature, lower return investments and higher yielding development opportunities.
The Board regularly reviews the capital available to the business with a view to ensuring that the Group has an appropriate capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and sustain the future development of the business.
The Board has processes in place to ensure capital is only committed to new schemes, for site purchase or build, when there is sufficient capital available.
These processes also ensure that capital is allocated to the opportunities offering the greatest return.
The Group regards its available capital as the amount of its adjusted net assets, as this excludes deferred tax and the fair value of financial instruments, which will not be crystallised in the normal course of trade and includes all property assets at market value.
At 31 December 2007 capital on this basis amounted to 510m 2006: 526m.
