74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations.
These calculations include forecast cash flows for a period of five years.
The five year cash flow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year year one and the business plans for years two and three, the results of which are reviewed by the board, and projections for years four and five, all of which reflect past experience as well as future expected market trends.
Cash flows beyond the five year forecast period are projected into perpetuity at the lower of the planned growth rate in year three and the forecast underlying economic growth rate for the economies in which the CGU operates.
Where the planned growth rate in year three exceeds the forecast underlying economic growth rate, the excess is progressively reduced in the projections for years four and five.
Growth rates across the groups CGUs range from 0% to 18%.
Future cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax, weighted average cost of capital which for the group is 11.3% 2006: 10.8%.
This rate is adjusted where appropriate to reflect the different financial risks in each country in which the CGUs operate.
In applying the groups model, no impairment has been identified and recognised in any of the groups CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2007 or for the year ended 31 December 2006.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rate and underlying economic growth rate.
With all other variables being equal, an impairment of approximately 5m would arise if either the group discount rate were to be increased by 1.5% to 12.8%, with an equivalent increase in the discount rate for all countries, or the underlying growth rate in all countries were to be reduced by 1.6%.
These approximations indicate the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the underlying assumptions.
However, it is highly unlikely that any variations in the assumptions would impact on all CGUs at the same time.
