73 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 13 Earnings per share continued Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders of 108.9m 2006: 76.5m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by employee share ownership trusts and those held as treasury shares which are both treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares is as follows: 2007 2006 Basic weighted average shares 151,914,241 150,847,303 Adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares 976,000 915,923 Diluted weighted average shares 152,890,241 151,763,226 The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share have been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per shares required by IAS 33 since, in the opinion of the Directors, they reflect the underlying performance of the businesss operations more appropriately.
The reconciliation of the earnings and earnings per share to their normalised equivalent is as follows: 2007 2007 2006 2006 2007 Basic EPS Diluted EPS 2006 Basic EPS Diluted EPS m p p m p p Profit loss attributable to equity shareholders 108.9 71.7 71.2 76.5 50.7 50.4 Loss from discontinued operations 2.9 1.9 1.9 3.2 2.1 2.1 Profit from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders 111.8 73.6 73.1 79.7 52.8 52.5 Goodwill impairment on continuing operations 20.2 13.4 13.3 Intangible asset amortisation 27.5 18.1 18.0 27.8 18.5 18.3 Exceptional charge for associate onerous contract provision 25.7 17.0 16.9 Exceptional items 15.8 10.4 10.3 4.8 3.2 3.1 Profit on disposal of non-current assets 16.2 10.7 10.6 16.9 11.2 11.1 Tax relief on goodwill and exceptional items 10.5 6.9 6.9 15.6 10.3 10.3 Normalised profit attributable to equity shareholders 128.4 84.5 83.9 116.1 77.0 76.5 14 Intangible assets Customer Finite Contractual Indefinite contracts Rail franchise life assets relationships Goodwill life assets Total m m m m m m m Cost: At 1 January 2007 190.8 11.7 202.5 18.0 596.7 614.7 817.2 Additions through business combinations 1.9 1.9 6.2 420.6 426.8 428.7 Disposals 0.6 1.8 2.4 2.4 Foreign exchange 16.2 16.2 2.4 60.3 62.7 78.9 At 31 December 2007 208.3 9.9 218.2 26.6 1,077.6 1,104.2 1,322.4 Amortisation and impairment: At 1 January 2007 28.5 4.3 32.8 86.8 86.8 119.6 Charge for year 26.4 1.1 27.5 27.5 Disposals 0.6 1.8 2.4 2.4 Foreign exchange 3.8 3.8 3.8 At 31 December 2007 58.1 3.6 61.7 86.8 86.8 148.5 Net book value: At 31 December 2007 150.2 6.3 156.5 26.6 990.8 1,017.4 1,173.9 At 1 January 2007 162.3 7.4 169.7 18.0 509.9 527.9 697.6 74 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 14 Intangible assets continued Customer FiniteContractual Indefinite contracts Rail franchise life assets relationships Goodwill life assets Total m m m m m m m Cost: At 1 January 2006 188.8 13.0 201.8 16.9 621.7 638.6 840.4 Additions through business combinations 7.3 7.3 3.2 9.7 12.9 20.2 Additions 0.3 0.3 0.3 Disposals 1.5 1.6 3.1 3.1 Foreign exchange 3.8 3.8 2.1 34.7 36.8 40.6 At 31 December 2006 190.8 11.7 202.5 18.0 596.7 614.7 817.2 Amortisation and impairment: At 1 January 2006 3.2 4.3 7.5 66.6 66.6 74.1 Charge for year 26.2 1.6 27.8 27.8 Annual impairment charge for the year UK Trains 19.2 19.2 19.2 Impairment charge for the year Other 1.0 1.0 1.0 Disposals 1.6 1.6 1.6 Foreign exchange 0.9 0.9 0.9 At 31 December 2006 28.5 4.3 32.8 86.8 86.8 119.6 Net book value: At 31 December 2006 162.3 7.4 169.7 18.0 509.9 527.9 697.6 At 1 January 2006 185.6 8.7 194.3 16.9 555.1 572.0 766.3 Due to the proximity of the combination to the year end, the Group has been unable to complete a detailed valuation of the intangible assets acquired with Continental Auto.
Accordingly, the surplus of consideration over the provisional fair value of the share of net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill at 31 December 2007.
Indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill have been allocated to individual cash-generating units for annual impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of indefinite life intangible assets by cash-generating unit is as follows: 2007 2006 Contractual 2007 Contractual 2006 2006 relationships Goodwill Total relationships Goodwill Total m m m m m m UK Bus 13.2 13.2 13.2 13.2 UK Coach 11.9 11.9 5.6 5.6 North American Bus 26.6 211.9 238.5 18.0 200.3 218.3 European Coach & Bus 753.8 753.8 290.8 290.8 26.6 990.8 1,017.4 18.0 509.9 527.9 The useful economic lives of contractual relationships in North America are deemed to be indefinite where historical experience has shown that these contracts are consistently renewed.
The customer contract and rail franchise intangible assets are amortised over the finite duration of the contract or franchise as appropriate.
All amortisation charges in the year have been charged to operating costs.
The recoverable amount of indefinite life intangible assets has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three year period.
Growth has then been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts.
