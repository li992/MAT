116 Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Financial statements The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value on the date at which they are granted.
Fair values are determined according to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, except in the case of share awards under the PRP and ESOP schemes which contain performance conditions based on total shareholder return compared to other entities in the media and entertainment sector.
These schemes are valued by external experts using a Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model.
The fair value per option for options granted in the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2007 2006 Scheme type PRP SAYE 22 SAYE 22 PRP SAYE 21 SAYE 21 Grant date 14.07.06 14.12.06 14.12.06 19.07.05 13.01.06 13.

In April 2006, under the Emap share plan, 298,965 April 2005: 312,708 free shares were issued in trust to employees with a vesting period of three years.
Employees receive dividends during the period and the fair value per share was 882.0p April 2005: 794.5p, the market price at the date of issue.
In July each year staff are invited under the Sharemap scheme to save a monthly amount for a year and to then use their savings to purchase Emap shares.
The purchase price is the lower of the share price at the beginning and end of the savings period.
Emap also matches the number of shares acquired by the employee and these are placed in trust with a vesting period of three years.
There is a charge to the profit and loss account for the one-year savings period and the three-year vesting period and the assumptions and fair values are as follows: 2007 2006 Start of savings period 01.07.06 01.07.05 End of savings period 30.06.07 30.06.06 Savings amount at grant date 802,548 784,560 Share price at grant date 849.5p 795.0p Expected volatility 20.6% 16.3% Risk free rate 4.7% 4.2% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 3.5% 3.1% Fair value for one year savings period 71.8p 54.0p Fair value for three year vesting period 911.9p 840.8p 117 Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
