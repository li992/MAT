29 Contingent liabilities Group a In July 2003, it was announced that two of the Groups subsidiaries and the Company were among those being sued in connection with an alleged infringement of patent number 6,560,580 580 Patent in the US.
The Group rejected the claim.
The jury trial commenced on 7 February 2005.
Prior to the commencement of the trial, the claimants stated their damage claims against the defendants, including the Group, to be an amount of up to $104m as at 30 September 2004.
On the first day of trial, the Court dismissed all of the monetary claims against the Group.
The Court also dismissed all of the claims challenging use of the OM Click Exchange System for ICAP Electronic Broking LLC IEB.
The case then proceeded to trial on the limited issue of the claimants request for injunctive relief as to the use of a second computer system, the ICAP Securities USA LLC ICAP Securities GTN and on the Groups counterclaim for judgement declaring that the ICAP Securities GTN did not infringe the 580 Patent.
On 22 February 2005, the jury found that the application for the 580 Patent failed to provide an adequate written description in certain of the 580 Patent claims.
In addition, the jury found that the ICAP Securities GTN infringed certain claims of the 580 Patent, but that the claimed infringement had not been wilful.
On 4 April 2005, the claimants and the Group filed post-trial applications.
On 12 December 2005, the Court ruled on the claimants and the Groups applications pertaining to the jurys verdict and denied all applications, thus leaving the jurys verdict undisturbed.
On 22 February 2006, the Court ruled on the Groups application pertaining to claimants asserted inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the 580 Patent.
The Court ruled in favour of the Group and declared that the 580 Patent was procured by inequitable conduct and as a result was unenforceable.
A final order as to all matters decided by the jury and the Court was entered on 3 April 2006.
On 27 April 2006 a claimant filed a Notice of Appeal seeking to appeal the jurys decision and the Courts ruling.
On 20 March 2007 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied the claimants appeal.
The claimants have filed an application asking that the US Court of Appeals reconsider its decision.
At this stage it is not possible to predict the outcome with certainty or to determine the extent of liability, if any, of the Group following any appeal but, based on current available information and after consultation with the Groups lawyers, the directors continue to expect a successful outcome for the Group.
