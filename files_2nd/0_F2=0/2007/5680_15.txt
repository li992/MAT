74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 82 Notes to the Company Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives financial instruments which have been measured at fair value and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985.
The according policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently through current and prior year.
Accounting policies Revenue Turnover represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Advertising revenues are recognized in the income statement on the date of publication.
Subscription revenues are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognized in the income statement over the period the event is run.
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line or other systematic basis as allowed by SSAP 21 'Accounting for Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts'.
Pension schemes Details of the company's pension schemes are set out in note 6 to the group accounts.
The company participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
It is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in this scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the scheme as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge included in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
Depreciation Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land and buildings 2% Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% - 33% Goodwill Where the company has divisionalized the unincorporated businesses of its subsidiaries, the investment in the subsidiary then has the substance of goodwill and is reclassified accordingly.
Goodwill arising in these circumstances is not amortized in the company where the directors are of the view that the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The non-amortization of goodwill represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 but is necessary to give a true and fair view under the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure, as it would depend on the life adopted.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of FRS 19 'Deferred Taxation', and is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallize based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences on un-remitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange of the related foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
82 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 83 Derivatives and other financial instruments The company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
Recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognized in the profit and loss account immediately.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognized in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the profit and loss account as they arise.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognized as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Liabilities for put options over the remaining minority interests in subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheet at their estimated discounted present value.
These discounts are unwound and charged to the income statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
In respect of options over further interests in joint ventures and associates, only movements in their fair value are recognised.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the profit and loss account when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
Dividends Dividends are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are approved by the company's shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Provisions A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If it is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Share-based payments The company makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20 'Share-based payments' has been applied to all grants of options after November 7 2002, that were unvested at October 1 2004, the date of application of FRS 20.
