31 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities relating to acquisitions The group is contractually bound to pay contingent deferred consideration for certain current and prior year acquisitions, based on the future performance of those acquired businesses.
Liabilities have been recognised based on managements best estimates of future amounts payable, where such estimates can be made reliably see note 21.
For certain acquisitions made in 2007, deferred consideration only becomes payable if significant performance improvements are acheived, in which case the amount payable is sensitive to the level of improvement achieved.
In these cases, until the level of future performance improvement becomes more certain, management are unable to make a reliable estimate of future amounts payable, and no deferred consideration liability has been recognised.
The maximum contingent deferred consideration payable for these acquisitions is 48.1m 2006 nil, but management considers that there is only a remote possibility of future payments approaching this level.
Amounts become payable between two and five years and any adjustment to deferred consideration as a result of revised estimates or final settlement will be recorded to goodwill.
Other guarantees and contingent liabilities The company and certain subsidiary undertakings have jointly and severally guaranteed bank loans and credit facilities of the group.
The maximum liabilities that could arise under these arrangements are 350.0m 2006 500.0m.
At 31 December 2007, amounts outstanding were 227.4m 2006 315.7m.

Various group companies are parties to legal actions and claims of 0.9m 2006 0.9m, the most significant of which are associated with employment-related matters.
Although there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome of these claims, the directors believe that adequate provision has been made for anticipated liabilities.
The group is also involved in various other legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business.
Management believe that the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain but is unlikely to have a material effect on the groups financial position.
