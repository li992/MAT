On 17 May 2006 the nominal value of the Companys new ordinary shares was reduced and the merger reserve created by the Scheme was capitalised through an issue of A shares, and subsequently reduced through a court-approved capital reduction, creating suf cient distributable reserves to enable the return of 512.5m to shareholders, leaving approximately 2 billion of distributable reserves after the return.
The Scheme and capital reduction resulted in the creation of a reverse acquisition reserve of 512.5 m in the consolidated accounts and a capital redemption reserve of 257.3m see note 24.
256.2m B shares were issued as the mechanism to facilitate the capital return, through: an initial dividend of 200 pence per share: an immediate 200 pence redemption per share: or retention of the B shares with the right to redeem semi-annually up to June 2009 see note 20.
Payments totalling 496.0m relating to the initial dividend and immediate redemption were made in May 2006.
The initial dividend was paid in respect of 119.4m B shares, which were immediately reclassi ed as deferred shares.
The deferred shares may be redeemed or cancelled by the Company in their entirety for a total consideration of one pence at any time, without prior notice, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme circular issued to shareholders in March 2006.
The Company intends to redeem all the deferred shares in July 2007 after the Annual General Meeting.
The immediate redemption was paid in respect of 128.6m B shares, which were immediately redeemed and cancelled creating a 257.3m capital redemption reserve.
On 1 December 2006, 0.4m B shares were redeemed and cancelled resulting in a further increase in the capital redemption reserve of 0.8m.
Consequently there were 7.8m B shares in issue at 31 March 2007, with aggregate nominal value of 15.7m see note 24.
79 After the Scheme and capital reduction, there were 216.0m ordinary shares in issue, at a nominal value of 6 pence per ordinary share.
86 During the year the Company re-purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 9.0m ordinary shares at an aggregate cost of 109.9m.
The excess of the consideration over the nominal value has been charged against retained earnings.
