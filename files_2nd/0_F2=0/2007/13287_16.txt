Employee benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
In April 2007, this scheme ceased any future accrual for current members and was closed to new members.
UK employees are now covered by a defined contribution scheme.
The pension cost relating to the UK defined benefit scheme for the period up to April 2007 has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method and relates entirely to current service costs.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was carried out at September 2006 and updated to 30th June 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 30th June 2007 30th June 2006 30th June 2005 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries n a 4.5% 3.7% Rate of increase in pension payments 3.1% 3.0% 2.5% Discount rate 5.7% 5.3% 5.0% Inflation rate 3.4% 3.0% 2.5% Expected return on equities 8.2% 8.5% 8.5% Expected return on cash 4.75% 4.0% 4.0% Expected return on bonds 5.3% 5.0% 4.7% Retirement age 64 64 65 The assets and liabilities in the defined benefit schemes were:- 30th June 30th June 30th June 2007 2006 2005 000 000 000 Market value of assets: Equities 89,924 70,836 52,450 Bonds and cash 1,575 1,377 1,350 91,499 72,213 53,800 Actuarial value of liabilities 85,937 91,051 74,500 Surplus deficit in the schemes 5,562 18,838 20,700 Deferred tax thereon 1,791 5,451 5,870 The mortality assumption adopted for 2007 is PA92, year of birth, short cohort, which reflects the increasing life expectancy.
