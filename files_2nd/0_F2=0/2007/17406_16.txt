At the balance sheet date the recoverable amounts of all cash generating units or groups of cash generating units were determined based on value in use calculations.
The cash flow projections used in these calculations were based on the following key assumptions: a Budgeted revenue and profit after taxation for 2008 as agreed by the Performance Committee, growing at the rate of 5% p. a. for 3 years and 3% p. a. thereafter for a total of 20 years which is consistent with our basic Strategic Plan.
b Maintaining margins at 2007 levels, despite a target to grow margins through operational leverage.
c Applying the weighted average cost of capital of 8.7% after taxation.
On the basis of the above assumptions the directors have concluded that there is no goodwill impairment.

Pensions Pension costs included in employee benefit costs consist of the following: 2007 2006 m m Defined benefit schemes 2.7 2.8 Defined contribution schemes 15.8 12.9 18.5 15.7 The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Defined contributions are charged to the income statement as they are incurred.
In the UK, there are six separate defined benefit schemes, all of which are closed to new members.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
In 2004, pensionable salaries were frozen following consultation with staff.
In Sweden, a proportion of the multi-employer Government run plan is treated as a defined benefit scheme.
This liability is unfunded and is carried in the Groups balance sheet.
The multi-employer Government plan retains substantial other assets to meet the balance of pension liabilities.
As the directors are unable to identify the underlying assets and liabilities of this portion of the scheme, this portion is treated as a defined contribution scheme for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For funded and unfunded defined benefit plans, any deficit of the fair value of plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they arise in the statement of recognised income and expense.
These reflect changes in actuarial assumptions, and differences between actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
The actuarial cost charged to the income statement in respect of defined benefit plans consists of current service costs, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, past service costs and costs of curtailments.
WSP Annual Report 2007 79 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2007 24.
Pensions continued The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations and their related current service cost are determined using the projected unit credit method.
Valuations are performed annually for the largest plans and on a regular basis for other plans.
Actuarial advice is provided both by external consultants and actuaries.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which the plan is located and are set out below.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily UK government bonds and the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested.
The expected return for each asset class was then applied to the schemes asset allocations to develop the overall expected long-term rate of return on assets for the combined portfolios.

Financial instruments The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, liquidity and interest rates.
An explanation of the Boards objectives, policies and strategies for holding and issuing financial instruments to manage these risks is set out in the Operating and Financial Review on page 25. a Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to the Swedish Kronor and the US Dollar.
Most trading activity is denominated in the currencies relevant to the local subsidiaries, thus matching the currency with its cost base.
The Group and the Company have 31.5m and 0.4m respectively of cash and cash equivalents at the year end held in bank accounts 2006: 19.9m the Group: 4.7m the Company which is immediately available for use.
Cash surplus to short term requirements is usually invested overnight on the money market to earn interest at rates close to the prevailing local base rates.
At 31 December 2007, if sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.2m 2006: 0.1m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US dollar denominated trade receivables and foreign exchange losses gains on US dollar denominated borrowings.
At 31 December 2007, if sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the Euro with all other variables held constant, posttax profit for the year would have been 0.8m 2006: 0.5m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of Euro denominated trade receivables and foreign exchange losses gains on Euro denominated borrowings.

There are no fixed rate and non-interest bearing liabilities 2006: nil.
The floating rate liabilities apply to short and medium-term bank overdrafts and loans with interest rates falling within the range 0.6% to 1.5% above the relevant country national bank base rates.
The Groups banking facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over a variety of the Groups assets including cross-guarantees from subsidiaries.
Finance lease obligations are secured on the assets to which they relate.
At 31 December 2007, if interest rates on currency-denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been 0.1m 2006: 0.1m lower higher, mainly as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
At 31 December 2007, if interest rates on UK sterling-denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been 0.2m 2006: 0.1m lower higher, mainly as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
Financial assets are non interest bearing with the exception of cash and cash equivalents as detailed in a above.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Financial instruments continued The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the costs of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio which is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is defined as total current and non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as Shareholders equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The gearing ratio at the end of the year equals 33% compared to the previous year of 27%.
This increase is representative of the acquisitive growth seen during the year and is consistent with the Groups Strategic Plan.
c Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
d Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities There were no outstanding currency swaps or derivatives at 31 December 2007 2006: nil and no designated hedges as defined by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

No such arrangements have been identified.
e Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities of the Group are considered to be materially equivalent to their book value.
Guarantees, contingent liabilities and other commitments At 31 December 2007 the Company and certain of its subsidiary undertakings cross guarantee the bank loans of the Group.
In common with other professional firms, the Group maintains professional indemnity insurance against claims for professional negligence which in the ordinary course of business have been, or may in the future be, received.
