Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of FKI plc are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by the Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Standards UK GAAP using the historical cost convention except where certain financial instruments have been measured at fair value.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account is not presented.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the cash flows of the Company are included within the published consolidated financial statements.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
All profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on all assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and machinery heavy production 15 years other 10 years Office equipment 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, less costs of disposal, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Leases Assets obtained under leases and hire purchase contracts which result in the transfer to the Company of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investments The Companys investment in shares in group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
109 FKI plc 1 Significant accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all timing differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax in respect of taxable or deductible timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where the timing differences can be controlled and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or in the case of assets, taxable profit will be unavailable against which the timing differences, can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible timing differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible timing differences, and carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which it is anticipated that the asset will be realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes Pension costs for the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount equal to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.
Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance sheet date.
Pension assets are measured at fair value.
The pension liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Companys defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows: a Within operating profit The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period: The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements to benefits: Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
b Within other finance cost or income The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of the period: The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the beginning of the period.
110 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued c Within the statement of total recognised gains and losses On the scheme assets the difference between the expected and actual return on assets: On the scheme liabilities a the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and b the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
Derivative financial instruments of hedge accounting The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financial and investment activities.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
As the Company accounts for its investments in subsidiaries and associates at cost in its separate books, certain derivative instruments could not be designated as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge in the Company accounts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges, where they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges eg: interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For cash flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
111 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments Certain employees including directors receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuation.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of FKI plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards at that date based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Company held by the employee share trust are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004.

This new 120 million facility, which runs until 1 April 2009, will provide working capital funding during a phase when the Companys operational performance is expected to benefit from strengthening end-markets and further strategic re-alignment of the portfolio.
It is expected that this will lead to improved financial metrics allowing the Company to subsequently refinance its maturing debt obligations in a cost-effective manner.
The terms and conditions under the new 120 million facility are very similar to the previous facility, but with some additional headroom under the financial covenants.

Changes in the fair value of these swaps are booked to profit or loss.
There have been no changes in these swaps during the year.

14 Contingent liabilities The Company has contingent liabilities of 20.4 million 2006: 16.7 million in respect of guarantees of subsidiary undertakings banking obligations.
In addition, the Company has guaranteed 49.7 million 2006: 100.0 million of US Dollar fixed rate guaranteed senior notes issued on behalf of FKI Industries Inc.
The Company is also the subject of various pending legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business, including claims on contracts, product liability, environmental claims and others.
The claims giving rise to such proceedings are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance and third-party indemnities.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not believe that these claims, after allowing for provisions already made, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys financial results.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payments under the guarantee.
