The net asset values per share are shown in the table both for the assets under control by the group and of its interest in these assets, i. e. after deduction for the minority interest share.
Adjustments are made for the deferred tax on the revaluation surplus and the post tax fair value of derivative financial instruments and the adjustment to the secured bond are excluded, on the basis that these amounts are not relevant when considering the group as an ongoing business.
Additionally, at 31st December 2006, adjusted net assets also excluded the deferred tax provided in respect of capital allowances claimed, on the basis that it was unlikely that this liability would ever crystallise.
