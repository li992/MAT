EEV assumptions continued At 31 December 2006 International UK Sterling Euro Contribution from new business % % % Risk-free rate 4.6 4.6 4.1 Market risks 2.2 1.1 2.1 Non-market risks 0.4 0.8 0.8 Risk discount rate 7.2 6.5 7.0 b Principal economic assumptions stochastic The cost of options and guarantees is determined using The Smith Model Plus economic scenario generator.
The model is calibrated to market conditions at the valuation date and correlations between the asset classes are derived from historic data, consistent with the model used for the Realistic Balance Sheet.
Risk-free rates are calibrated to the Gilt yield curve.
Equity volatility is calibrated to replicate the implied volatility of FTSE 100 put options held by the FPLP With-Profits Fund.
Property is calibrated to 15% initial volatility and a 6.5% pa running yield.
Sample implied volatilities by asset class At 31 December 2007 Term years 5152535 15-year risk-free zero coupon bonds 7.9% 5.1% 4.6% 4.7% 15-year corporate bonds 10.5% 9.9% 10.0% 10.2% Equity 25.4% 25.8% 25.8% 27.8% Property 15.4% 16.5% 17.9% 18.4% At 31 December 2006 Term years 5152535 15-year risk-free zero coupon bonds 7.1% 4.7% 4.6% 5.1% 15-year corporate bonds 9.4% 8.6% 8.3% 8.8% Equity 17.1% 18.2% 19.6% 20.8% Property 15.1% 16.4% 17.9% 19.0% The volatility represents the variation of return around the average for the particular asset class.
Bonus rates are set at levels which fully utilise the assets supporting the in-force business over its lifetime and are consistent with the economic assumptions and the Groups bonus policy.
c Other assumptions Other assumptions for example mortality, morbidity, persistency and expenses are a reflection of our best estimate of the likely behaviours, outcomes or circumstances in the future.
Typically the estimates are made on an annual basis following experience investigations based on the data available at the time both from our own book of business and externally sourced information.
The aim is to set assumptions at a level that reflects recent experience, unless there are reliable indicators that suggest their adoption would result in a significant variance compared to these assumptions in the future.
In some instances, there may be little or no direct experience to use in setting assumptions and the future outcome is therefore uncertain.
In terms of future improvements in annuitant mortality, these have been assumed to be in accordance with the medium cohort projections with certain amendments published by the CMI in 2002.
The amendments are to use 75% of these projections for females and to introduce a minimum annual rate of improvement in future mortality - for males this is assumed to be 1% pa and for females 0.75% pa. 13.
Sensitivities Sensitivities of the EEV results to revised assumptions are given in note 31 to the IFRS financial statements.
