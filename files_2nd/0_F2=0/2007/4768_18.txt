A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in the financial statements.
In the current period, the Companys financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007.
For the comparative period, the Companys financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements and has not prepared a cash flow statement as the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc, which include a cash flow statement.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 8, Related Party Transactions, not to disclose transactions with subsidiary undertakings, 90 per cent or more of whose voting rights are controlled within the Group.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 29, Financial Instruments and Disclosures, not to disclose details of any financial instruments held.
Implementation of UITF 44 During the period, the Group has adopted UITF 44 in respect of share option schemes, which has required a prior year adjustment to the Companys financial statements.
As a result, the charge for such schemes is recognised in a subsidiary of the Company.
The Companys financial statements now reflect the cost of the scheme as an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiary.
The financial impact for the Company is to decrease the reported net assets at 29 December 2006 by 0.4 million.
This represents a 1.4 million increase in investments and a 1.8 million reduction in deferred taxation.
Fixed assets investments Fixed asset investments are stated at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or at the end of the first full financial year following the recognition.
Any impairment in the value of fixed assets below depreciated historical cost is charged to the profit and loss account within operating profit.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Employee share schemes The Company operates two employee share schemes: The Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE and Long Term Incentive Plan Scheme LTIP.
The expected fair value of the share options awarded under the LTIP scheme are charged to the profit and loss account over the period in which the right to the options is earned.
The fair value is calculated by reference to the market value of the shares at the date on which the options are awarded reduced by any consideration payable by the relevant employee.
Details of Directors remuneration can be found in the Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 23 to 29.
Taxation including deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely than not to be recoverable.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Employee share trust The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the Directors consider that Dignity plc has fide facto control.
In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the transaction, the trusts assets and liabilities are recognised in the Companys balance sheet within share capital and reserves.
