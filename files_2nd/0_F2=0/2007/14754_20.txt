For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as several cash-generating units, one for each component of goodwill recognised at the balance sheet date, and one for all other consumer products.
The cash-generating units recoverable amounts are based on value in use using projections of the Groups performance over 10-15 years, periods reflecting the Directors best estimates of the cash flows.
A risk adjusted discount factor of 6.8 per cent has been applied to the projections.
The impairment charge in the year relates to the impairment of goodwill relating to the Remegel locally owned brand.
An amount is also held within other intangible assets in relation to this brand.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting the future cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the brand.
To determine cash flows budgeted sales of the Remegel locally owned brand and operating results were used.
Internal business plan models were utilised to derive expected future revenue decline of 8.8 per cent per annum.
Operating margins were expected to decline by 2 per cent per annum.
Results were projected forward over a period of 12 years and discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount factor of 6.8 per cent.
The resulting impairment was allocated to the goodwill with no impairment of the amount held within other intangible assets required.
The most significant factors affecting the valuation were the level of operating profit margin associated with the brand and the percentage sales decline.
If sales had been held constant in the valuation model with all other assumptions as described above the impairment charge would have been 1.0 million lower.
An increase in initial operating margin percentage by five percentage points would have reduced the impairment by 0.4 million and an increase in initial operating margin percentage by 10 percentage points would have reduced the impairment charge by 0.8 million.
Material assets The Scholl brand, with a carrying value of 60.2 million at 31 March 2007, is not amortised.
The brand has been tested for impairment using the method described below.
No charge for impairment was required in the year.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the Scholl brand, the Group is regarded as two cash-generating units, that part relating to Scholl branded products and that relating to all other consumer products.
The Scholl brands recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the brand using the following key assumptions: cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
revenue growth was anticipated at 2 per cent per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years.
This is in line with experience in prior years.
operating results were then held at the year 10 figures into perpetuity reflecting the Directors assertion that the brand has an indefinite useful economic life because of its proven value over long periods and its position in the market which is considered sustainable for the foreseeable future.
a risk adjusted discount factor of 6.8 per cent was applied to the projections.
64 65 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8.
Goodwill and intangible assets continued For the Scholl brand to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 13.4 per cent before the brands value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 15.0 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 27.8 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
No impairment review has been carried out in the current year for goodwill of 17.2 million arising on the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited in January 2007 note 9.
An impairment review of this goodwill will be carried out in the next year and annually thereafter.
The remaining goodwill is made up of a number of balances, none of which are significant, with a total net book value of 11.0 million.
Other intangible assets comprise a number of non-material cash-generating units.

The principal activity of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited is the manufacture of healthcare products.
In January 2007 the Group purchased the remaining 50 per cent of the company for cash consideration of US $37.5 million.
Following the acquisition the company contributed revenue of 2.5 million and operating profit 1.4 million.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006 consolidated revenue for the Group would have been 488.2 million and profit for the year would have been 37.4 million.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities at the acquisition date: Pre-acquisition Recognised carrying Fair value value on amounts adjustments acquisition m m m Property, plant and equipment 1.1 1.1 Inventories 0.9 0.9 Cash and cash equivalents 5.6 5.6 Trade and other payables 3.5 3.5 Current tax payable Net identifiable assets and liabilities 4.1 4.1 Less amounts recognised as share of associate prior to acquisition 2.1 Goodwill on acquisition note 8 17.2 Consideration paid, satisfied in cash 19.2 Less cash acquired 5.6 Net cash outflow 13.6 Includes legal fees of 0.1 million.
The excess of fair value of consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired has been attributed wholly to goodwill as the Group supplies the brand and knowhow to the business and existing customer relationships were terminated as part of the sale and purchase agreement.
The goodwill acquired represents the benefits of securing control of the financial and operating policies of the business.
This is expected to lead to increased profits as a result of the establishment of new distributor relationships at higher margins to those achieved previously and the opportunity to establish the Scholl brand alongside Durex in this key market.
In time the acquisition will also provide synergies to the Groups manufacturing cost base by providing additional condom manufacturing capacity to support the Group supply chain.
The Group has not recognised as part of the acquisition an asset in relation to the Durex brand as the Group already owned the brand worldwide prior to the acquisition.
Qingdao London Durex Company Limited has an annual reporting date of 31 December.

The US$ 8.02 per cent loan notes were issued in November 1999, and are repayable in six further equal instalments maturing in November 2009.
The loan notes are not secured on any assets of the Group.
The notional amount and payment terms of loan notes and swaps are equal.

The notional amount of the US$ 8.19 per cent loan notes is US$104.2 million 2006: US$104.2 million.
The Sterling loan notes were issued in November 1999, and are repayable in full, in November 2014.
The US$ loan notes were issued in November 1999, and are repayable in full, in November 2009.
The fair value of the 7.87 per cent guaranteed loan notes, held at amortised cost, is 6.2 million 2006: 6.2 million.
The fair value of the 8.19 per cent also held at amortised cost is 56.1 million 2006: 59.7 million.
The loans and swaps do not constitute a fair value hedge under IFRS.
Consequently the Group is exposed to fair value changes from interest rate movements in the US$ and Sterling.
These fair value changes have resulted in a credit of 1.8 million in the income statement for the year.
The Groups exposure to fair value changes is considered further in note 22.

Overseas termination benefits Included with overseas termination benefits is an amount of 2.8 million 2006: 2.6 million for termination benefits payable to employees in a number of overseas subsidiaries.
Benefits accrue with service and are payable to employees upon departure from the Group regardless of the reason for such departure.
Benefits may be calculated with reference to an average salary over the service life of the employee or the final salary of the employee.
Differences arising due to changes in assumptions in calculating the liability for employees are taken through reserves and are included above within exchange and other movements.
The main assumptions underlying the calculation on a weighted average basis across the various schemes are salary increases of 2.0 per cent, an inflation rate of 2.0 per cent and a discount rate of 3.0 per cent.
The calculation of the provision is determined by contractual obligation and therefore can be estimated reliably.
No terminations are expected in the next year.
Provision is also made for termination payments which may be required for sales agents.
At the year end an amount of 1.1 million was provided.
In the prior year an amount of 1.3 million was included with payables due after more than one year.
The amount provided is based upon payments which would be required under collective agreements to sales agents upon termination of their contracts by the Group.
Increases and decreases in the provision, aside from utilisation, are reflected within the income statement.
Disposals Following the Groups disposal of the medical business, in 2004 and 2005, a number of disposal provisions were created for the ongoing commitments of the Group in respect of the disposals.
The Group has continued to utilise these provisions during the current year.
It is expected that all remaining provisions will be utilised during the next year.
Manufacturing restructuring During 2005 the Group announced its decision to close the Derby manufacturing plant and transfer production to India.
This process remains ongoing and the amounts provided reflect the future expected costs of completing this transfer.
3.4 million, which relates to a provision for a non-cancellable lease for the Derby site, has been reclassified into Other during the year.
It is expected that all other remaining provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
Group and commercial restructuring The Group has continued in the current year with its rationalisation and restructuring of commercial operations.
Provisions brought forward in respect of employee costs have been utilised in the year.
The remaining provision relates to additional costs not yet incurred.
It is expected that the provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
Other Other provisions relate to a number of pre-merger environmental provisions of 0.7 million, surplus property provisions of 6.2 million and any other obligations following previous acquisitions of 0.1 million.
Environmental provisions are provided for to the extent that a present obligation exists, it is probable such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
No provision is made for possible additional costs that are not currently probable.
The surplus property provision relates to Group commitments under non-cancellable leases for sites which, following historical restructuring exercises, are no longer used by the Group.
The obligation, net of expected rental income, has been provided for.
During the year 3.4 million has been transferred from the manufacturing restructuring provision in relation to surplus property costs arising from the non-cancellable lease for the Derby site.
Surplus property costs of 5.6 million and environmental provisions of 0.6 million have been included as non-current.
It is expected that all other provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
Post-retirement benefits The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans both in the UK and overseas.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
UK Pensions a Defined contribution schemes Since 1995, the Group has operated a contracted-in defined contribution scheme which is open to UK employees.
It also operates defined contribution executive pension plans for senior executives.
Employer contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was 1.4 million 2006 : 1.4 million.
b Defined benefit schemes The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to form Seton Scholl in 1998, and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and LIG in 1999.
All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants.
The finances of all schemes are assessed regularly by independent actuaries and all assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes have provided benefits for employees as outlined below: i Seton Prior to 1995, the Group operated a defined benefit scheme for employees.
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this scheme ceased in August 1995, but existing benefits at that date are being maintained.
The latest valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 0.5 million into the scheme during the next financial year.
ii Scholl Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in August 2000, but benefits accrued to 31 August 2000 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The recent valuation by independent actuaries was at 5 April 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 0.6 million into the scheme during the next financial year.
iii LIG Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in January 2001, but benefits accrued to 31 January 2001 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 8.2 million into the scheme during the next financial year.
Overseas pensions and similar obligations The Group has a number of pension schemes in different countries both defined benefit and defined contribution.
Defined benefit schemes are set up under separate trust funds and liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of overseas defined contribution schemes was 1.9 million 2006: 1.3 million.
Details of the material overseas defined benefit schemes are given opposite.

The Groups variable rate financial derivatives and variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.
Hedging Interest rate and currency swaps, denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling, have been executed to hedge the Groups exposure to risks in accordance with its interest rate policy.
These swaps are matched in maturity to the underlying debt.
At 31 March 2007, the Group had interest rate and currency swaps with a notional amount of 11.9 million 2006: 4.5 million.
Interest rate swaps including those in effective fair value hedging relationships are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
The fair value of interest and currency swaps recognised as hedges at 31 March 2007 is a net liability of 1.6 million comprising assets of 17.8 million and liabilities of 19.4 million 2006: net liability of 1.4 million comprising assets of 25.1 million and liabilities of 26.5 million.
From 1 April 2005 interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges are fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance expense.
Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships are adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through income statement to offset any mark-to-market arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness is carried out semi-annually.
All designated hedges have remained effective throughout the current financial year.
The maturity dates of all financial liabilities, together with details of their fair values and carrying values are disclosed in note 15.

d Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used, applied consistently, in estimating the fair value of financial instruments reflected in the tables in section a : Derivatives The fair value of all derivatives are estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve valuation technique based on rates prevailing at the year end in the relevant currencies.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of all loans are estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve valuation technique based on rates prevailing at the year end in the relevant currencies.
A credit spread is added to yield curves to obtain an accurate basis for fair value.
Trade and other receivables payables For all other receivables and payables, categorised as financial assets or liabilities under IAS 39, but not presented within financial assets or liabilities in these financial statements, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
e Credit risk Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded derivatives.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of nonperformance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through use of these instruments.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments with a positive carrying value at the balance sheet date.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks in line with Group policy.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet date were 9.5 million 2006: 6.6 million.
