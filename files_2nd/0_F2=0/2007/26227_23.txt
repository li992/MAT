CAPITAL REVIEW a As at 31 December 2007 Conversion of Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL to an Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV On 1 November 2007, LGPL was converted to an ISPV and repaid subordinated debt of 400m to Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society.
Societys long term fund restructure In December 2007, the Group implemented a new capital structure for Society.
A key component was the removal of the transfer formula which has limited the annual amounts of distribution from Societys long term fund since 1996.
As part of the restructure, it was also announced that the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
Societys Board of Directors has undertaken to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment will gradually reduce to zero over a period not exceeding ten years.
The removal of the formula and the merger of the 1996 Sub-fund with the SRC have removed significant dividing lines between the pools of shareholder capital within Society.
From 2007, all the shareholder assets supporting the UK non profit life and pensions businesses have been aggregated for reporting purposes and designated Society Shareholder Capital.
This comprises the SRC including the merged 1996 Sub-fund, and all Societys shareholder capital held outside the long term fund and in LGPL.
For 2007, 1.7bn 2006: 272m has been transferred from the SRC into the shareholder capital held outside Societys long term fund.
Financial impacts of ISPV conversion and Societys long term fund restructure The effects of the changes on the EEV financial statements are shown in the table below: Long Tax ISPV term fund impact of 1 2,3 4 conversion restructure restructure Total m m m m profit from continuing operations before tax 156 5 - 161 Embedded value 112 4 206 322 1.
The conversion of LGPL to an ISPV resulted in an increase in embedded value of 112m and an increase in profit before tax of 156m.
This reects the removal of the requirement to hold a solvency margin in the ISPV and the consequent reduction in the modelled cost of solvency capital.
In Society, the SRC and 1996 Sub-fund have either been required to cover the EU solvency margin or regarded as encumbered due to the restrictions over distribution.
Following the restructure, these assets are no longer encumbered and are valued at market value less the anticipated tax charge.
The Group has previously modelled EEV operating profit assuming the SRC is released into surplus over a period of 20 years.
It is assumed that the remainder of the SRC is distributed over two years with the exception of the contingent loan balance with LGPL which is assumed to be distributed as it is repaid.
To take account of the more exible nature of the capital in Society, the assets modelled to cover the required capital now reect the average investment mix of the total Society Shareholder Capital which, as a result, includes a higher proportion of xed interest investments.
The transfer from the SRC into the Society Shareholder Capital at the end of 2007 did not give rise to any incremental tax.
The tax impact on future distributions of SRC assets has been modelled using marginal tax rates of between 10% and 12%.
The combined impact for the four factors above on both contribution from new business after cost of capital and operating profit was an increase of 12m.
Following the restructure, the shareholder net worth SNW of the UK life and pensions business has been redened to include the shareholder capital held outside the long term fund.
The longer term investment return earned on these assets of 52m 2006: 104m is included in UK contribution from SNW for 2007.
In the segmental analysis of shareholders equity, the shareholder capital held outside the long term fund of 2,109m 2006: 1,307m has been reallocated to UK life and pensions covered business at the balance sheet date.
Prior year comparatives have not been restated to reect this reclassication.

CAPITAL REVIEW continued b As at 31 December 2006 The impacts from restructuring and capital changes reported last year are set out below.
Corporate restructuring On 31 December 2006, the non-linked non profit pensions and annuity business of Society was ceded to a new, wholly owned, reinsurance company, LGPL.
The required capital and free surplus of LGPL is included in the covered business.
LGPL was capitalised using 1.3bn of Society shareholder capital, 400m of this was represented by subordinated debt 200m upper tier II, 200m lower tier II and 900m by equity.
The reinsurance was effected on arms length terms resulting in an initial regulatory loss in LGPL.
Further funds of 571m were injected from Societys long term fund into LGPLs long term fund by means of a contingent loan to cover this loss.
Prior to the capitalisation of LGPL, the intra-group subordinated debt capital of 602m attributed to SRC was repaid to Group Plc and an equivalent amount was lent to Society shareholder capital on a subordinated basis 301m upper tier II, 301m lower tier II.
Overall, the corporate restructuring increased the embedded value by 171m.
This arose from tax benets totalling 322m, which included a reversal of the adverse impact of the 2005 UK tax changes.
This was offset by an additional cost of solvency capital of 119m in LGPL and other impacts of 32m which together total 151m.
The EEV impact of the net tax benets is reported within the tax section of the income statement.
The impact of the higher cost of solvency capital and other impacts is reported below operating profit and grossed up for tax at 30%.
The tax gross up of 65m is included in the tax charge.
The additional cost of solvency capital in respect of new business transferred to LGPL reduced the contribution from new business by 19m.
Implementation of changes to FSA reporting and capital rules Policy Statement 06 14 In 2006, the FSA introduced a more realistic reserving framework for certain non profit business.
As a result, there was a reduction in the regulatory reserves required for term assurance business of 641m.
The associated financial reinsurance previously in place to finance these reserves was terminated.
The impact of these changes was to increase the EEV operating assumption changes by 64m, and contribution from new business by 33m, due to the resulting lower capital requirements.
Review of annuity investment policy During 2006, Society undertook a review of its asset liability matching policy for annuity business.
Property assets backing annuity liabilities were replaced with corporate bonds and Society entered into ination swaps to mitigate negative ination risk.
As a result, a closer match between assets and liabilities was achieved.
Additionally, the margin within the reserves to cover an interest rate mismatch was reviewed and reduced.
EEV operating profit increased by 18m due to the reduction in the capital requirement.
However, the EEV variation from longer term investment return reduced by 27m due to the change in asset mix.

For covered business, Investment management comprises managed pension funds and is included in the total Investment management result of 196m 2006: 181m.
The UK expected return on in-force is based on the unwind of the discount rate on the opening, adjusted base value of in-force VIF.
The opening base VIF was 2,428m in 2007.
This is adjusted for the effects of opening model changes 52m to give an adjusted opening base VIF of 2,480m.
This is then multiplied by the opening risk discount rate 7.6% and the result grossed up at the notional attributed tax rate of 28% to give a return of 262m.
The UK contribution from shareholder net worth SNW of 319m is based on a mechanical calculation from opening balance sheet values.
It reects a different treatment for that part of the SNW which is discounted for the time value of money and that which is held at face value.
The first element 277m is based on the unwind of the discount rate on the opening, adjusted base SNW.
This is adjusted for the effects of opening model changes 18m to give an adjusted opening base SNW of 2,626m.
c. The adjusted opening base SNW is multiplied by the opening risk discount rate of 7.6% and the result grossed up at the notional attributed tax rate of 28% to give a return of 277m.
The second element 99m is the pre-tax smoothed investment return on other SNW assets held at face value.
This is offset by pre-tax corporate expenses charged to shareholders funds of 13m.
In 2007, the contribution from SNW was also adjusted for one-off modelling changes and second order tax effects of negative 44m 32m net of the notional attributed tax rate of 28%.
UK life and pensions variation from longer term investment return comprises 246m 2006: 185m relating to the value of in-force business and negative 118m 2006: 202m relating to SNW.

TAX continued Effect of UK Budget tax changes The Finance Act 2007 contained two measures which increased the UK embedded value by 93m.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008 increased the post-tax profits from the UK life and pensions and managed pension funds businesses reported on an EEV basis over the projection period.
The effect was to increase the UK embedded value by 101m.
This was offset by a reduction of 8m from the requirement to tax the loan interest payable by LGPL to the SRC at the full UK corporation tax rate.
Tax impact of Corporate restructure There was no incremental tax for 2007 on the transfer of the SRC, whereas marginal tax rates of between 10% and 12% had been assumed for 2006.
The favourable impact on EEV was 206m.
For 2006, the favourable impact of 322m arose primarily from the reversal of the effect of the UK tax changes reported in 2005.

In previous periods, UK SNW represented the amounts in the Society long term fund and LGPL shareholder capital which were regarded as either required capital or free surplus held within the covered business.
As a consequence of the Capital review, from 2007, all shareholder capital in Society and LGPL is included as SNW within the covered business.

Investment management covered business comprises managed pension funds and is included in the total Investment management shareholders equity of 689m 2006: 592m.
On an EEV basis, the contingent loan between Society and LGPL is modelled as an asset of SNW.
As profits from the in-force business of LGPL are earned, cash is realised and transferred to SNW and the contingent loan asset is reduced accordingly.
The movement includes both repayment of capital relating to in-force business and drawdown of loan relating to new business written in the period.
Further details relating to the impact of the Capital review can be found in Note 14.
Included in the profit for the period is an inter-fund transfer from non profit included in VIF to SSC included in SNW of 60m.
