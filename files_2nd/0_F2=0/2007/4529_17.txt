NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION Introduction Debenhams plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985 Company No.
The address of the registered office is Debenhams plc, 1 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AA.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or the Debenhams Group is the sale of fashion clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home.
The Group trades from department stores and small store formats in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, on the internet and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its financial statements for the financial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
The principal companies within the Group during the financial year ended 1 September 2007 are disclosed in note 33.
The Company gained admission to the London Stock Exchange on 9 May 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
The consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 1 September 2007 and 2 September 2006 have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments, derivatives, share-based payments and pensions.
The preparation of the financial statements, in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The directors believe that the underlying operating profit before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
It is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with underlying profit measures used by other companies.

Consolidation The financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries include all entities including special purpose entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 54 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession sales are recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card.
Department customer special orders and internet sales are recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer.
Revenue from gift vouchers and gift cards sold by the Group are recognised on the redemption of the gift voucher or gift card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Interest recognition Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
Dividend distribution A final dividend distribution to the Group shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Group shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Retirement benefit costs The liability recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes is the present value of the defined obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plans assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expenses.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Groups contributions to stakeholder pension schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each class of award, either a Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or Binomial pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjust for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are events or transactions which, by virtue of their size or nature, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial statements.
Foreign exchange a Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentational currency.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 55 Section 4 Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Group companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction : and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
c Transactions and balances Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on exchange are taken to the income statement.
Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leased assets a Finance leases Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are classified as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the period of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b Operating leases All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed fixed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 56 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised, but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
b Other intangible assets Acquired licences and trademarks are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, not to exceed ten years.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
The software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, being three to eight years.
Property, plant and equipment It is the Groups policy to hold properties at cost, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1 per cent Long leaseholds including landlords fixtures and fittings 1 per cent or life of lease if shorter Short leaseholds including landlords fixtures and fittings Life of lease Retail fixtures and fittings 5 20 per cent Office equipment 10 per cent 1 1 Computer equipment 16 2 33 3 per cent Vehicles 25 per cent or life of lease The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise stores, which are under construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
Impairment testing Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Available-for-sale investments The Group classifies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Available-for-sale financial investments are non-derivative assets.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs.
If a fair value for an investment cannot be reliably measured, due to the variability in the range of reasonable fair value estimates being significant, or the probabilities of the various estimates within the range not being able to be reasonably assessed, that investment will be carried at cost.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 57 Section 4 Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
Concession stocks are not included within stocks held by the Group.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, defined as loans and receivables in accordance with IAS 39, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method for any doubtful amounts.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Any other trade receivables are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts.
An allowance is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are facility costs are recognised initially at fair value, and are amortised over the term of the facilities at a constant rate on the committed amount of the facility.
Trade payables Trade payables, defined as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any other trade payables are stated at cost.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Derivatives The derivative instruments used by the Group to manage its interest rate and currency risk are interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward currency contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 58 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Derivatives are recognised using trade date accounting.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
i Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the income statement which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the balance sheet or in the income statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is immediately recognised in the relevant line of the income statement which will be affected by the original underlying hedged item.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the relevant line of the income statement which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
iii Embedded derivatives Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the contracts, and the whole contract is not carried at fair value with gains or losses reported in the income statement, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected in the account in the income statement which will be affected by the underlying host contract.
New standards and interpretations During the year, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued the following standards and interpretations which are effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date.
These standards and interpretations are not effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of this financial information: Effective date International Accounting Standards IFRS IAS IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IFRIC Interpretations IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programme 1 July 2008 IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding requirement and their Interaction 1 January 2008 Other than in relation to IFRIC 14, which the Group is currently considering the implications of, the adoption of these standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material impact on the Group operations.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 59 Section 4 Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT a Financial risks and treasury management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: funding and liquidity risk: credit risk: foreign exchange risk: and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The board has established an overall treasury policy and has approved procedures and authority levels within which the treasury function Group Treasury must operate.
The Finance Director conducts a treasury review at least monthly and the Treasury Committee meets and performs their review on a quarterly basis.
The board receives regular reports covering treasury activities.
Treasury policy is to manage risks within an agreed framework whilst not taking speculative positions.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
The objective is to ensure that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash flow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
ii Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash, cheque or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with financial counterparties with a short-term credit rating of A1, P1 or better.
iii Foreign exchange risk The Groups functional currency is sterling.
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro and the US dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions relating to imports and trading in the Republic of Ireland.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of 18 months or less, up to 100 per cent of the first three months forecasted purchases, up to 80 per cent of the next 12 months are hedged.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling business.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 60 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED iv Cash flow interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
The Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The Groups exposure to floating-rate interest is within financial covenants and planned expectation.
The aim is to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target fixed percentage of 75 per cent, with a 15 per cent tolerance 60 90 per cent.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps and caps.
These are usually matched with specific loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the financing rate loans under the credit facility.
b Fair value estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year-end exchange rates.
4 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Based on an analysis of risks and returns, the directors consider that the Group has only one identifiable business segment, retailing.
All material operations of the Group are carried out in the UK and therefore no geographical segmentation is disclosed.
The group operates both an internet and international division, both of which remain immaterial for the purposes of segmental reporting.
Consequently, the Group has considered business segmentation as the primary segmentation, with a single separately reportable segment, retailing.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 61 Section 4 Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 5 GROSS TRANSACTION VALUE Revenue from concessions is required to be shown on a net basis, being the commission received rather than the gross value achieved by the concessionaire on the sale.
Management believe that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide to the value of the overall activity of the Group.
1 September 2 September 2007 2006 m m Gross transaction value 2,305.6 2,192.9 6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The method requires an estimate of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash flows.
Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
At each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 28.
Pension liability The Groups defined benefit schemes pension liability, which is assessed each period by actuaries, is based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, inflation, future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions: additional information relating to this is disclosed in note 24.
Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment The Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each financial period end.
The Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 62 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 7 ANALYSIS OF COSTS BY NATURE 1 September 2 September 2007 2006 m m The following items have been included in arriving at operating profit: The amounts of inventory written down during the financial year 14.8 11.0 Cost of inventories recognised as an expense 870.4 818.4 Employment costs note 9 293.2 276.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment note 16 : owned assets 84.4 85.3 assets held under finance leases 1.3 0.7 Accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment note 16 : owned assets 7.7 assets held under finance leases 0.5 Amortisation of intangible assets note 15 7.0 5.1 Loss profit on disposal of: property, plant and equipment 0.6 0.1 Operating lease rentals: property 134.8 130.2 other 1.4 1.6 Foreign exchange gains 5.9 2.6 Repairs and maintenance expenditure on property, plant and equipment 12.1 12.4 Auditors remuneration 0.3 1.1 Operating lease costs and incentives The amount charged to the income statement in respect of operating lease costs and incentives for the Group has changed significantly under IFRS.

Following the acquisition, the Group assigned the existing Dublin store lease Jervis Street which will result in the closure of the store after the year end.
The acquisition of the stores, assignment of the lease and subsequent closure of the Jervis Street store has created an accelerated depreciation charge of 6.3 million and redundancy costs of 4.6 million.
Marketing, travel, legal and integration costs amounted to 3.4 million.
Integrated costs include 0.8 million of costs which related to the distribution centre and have been charged to distribution costs, all other costs relate to the stores and have been charged to cost of sales.
Financial year ended 2 September 2006 Admission to the London Stock Exchange Costs relating to the Companys admission to the London Stock Exchange on 9 May 2006 include taxation and restructuring advice, legal and professional fees, bonuses and other advisory services, relating to printing costs, marketing and public relations, all of which related to the admission.

Interest on refinancing On 30 May 2006 the Group refinanced its debt, which resulted in the repayment of the senior credit facilities.
As a result of this repayment the Group wrote-off all unamortised debt issue costs associated with the senior credit facility.
Additional interest relating to the early repayment of the senior credit facility was paid on refinancing together with the cost associated with the restructuring of the interest rate swaps.

The closing deferred tax for assets and liabilities has been calculated at the reduced rate with the movement being charged or credited to the income statement except where the original asset or liability was created in equity.
The tax for the year is higher 2006: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30 per cent.

It will be paid on 4 January 2008 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 7 December 2007.
An interim dividend of 2.5 pence per share was paid on 4 July 2007 2006: nil which absorbed 21.5 million 2006: nil of shareholders funds.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 66 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 14 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

It is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, the impact of leases with fixed annual increments in rent and charges relating to share-based payments.
In 2006, the Group underwent significant re-financing and therefore the statutory interest and related financing costs are not comparable year-on-year.
The above adjustment for interest assumes that the 2006 re-financing, which took place at the date of admission, was effective at the beginning of the year ended 2 September 2006 and that the proceeds of shares issued on admission 700 million were available at that date.
The comparison of performance year-on-year has also been made complex by costs incurred as a result of the Companys admission to the London Stock Exchange on 9 May 2006, which increased the number of shares issued by the Company.
The underlying earnings per share uses the capital structure as at 1 September 2007 to eliminate the effect of these changes.

The consideration for this acquisition was 30.0 million, with 20.5 million payable on completion, 3.4 million payable on the first anniversary and 6.1 million on the second anniversary of completion.
All tangible assets acquired have been recognised at their respective fair values.
The fair values of tangible fixed assets, stock and receivables acquired were 13.4 million, 10.3 million and 0.6 million respectively.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill and amounts to 5.7 million.
The goodwill represents the intrinsic value to the Group of being able to trade the Debenhams brand in these stores.
Licences and trademarks The Group acquired the St George by Duffer trademark during the year.
The total consideration for the trademark was 2.8 million.
Software development costs The computer software capitalised of 5.3 million 2006: 11.3 million principally relates to internally developed application software.
Externally developed application software at 1 September 2007 amounted to 1.0 million 2006: 1.2 million.
Amortisation on the Groups intangible assets has been charged to the income statement as follows for the financial years ended: 1 September 2 September 2007 2006 m m Included within: cost of sales 4.6 3.5 distribution costs 0.3 0.2 administrative expenses 2.1 1.4 7.0 5.1 Impairment test for goodwill The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Debenhams Group Holdings Limited by Baroness Group Holdings Limited on 4 December 2003, is not being amortised but reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill for Debenhams Group Holdings Limited represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of Cash-Generating Units CGUs on a regional basis within the UK according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 68 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 15 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of no growth after year five.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 7.5 per cent 2006: 8.5 per cent and reflects the specific risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates.
As at 1 September 2007, no impairment of goodwill has been required 2006: nil.

Ermes gained admission to the Cyprus Stock Exchange during 2007 and at 1 September 2007 the Group continues to hold 10 per cent of the issued share capital, being 17,500,000 shares.
The market value of the shares at 1 September 2007 was 16.2 million.
As at 3 September 2006 Ermes was a private company, the fair value of the shares was deemed not to be significantly different to the historic cost and the investment was therefore carried at a cost of 4.2 million.
Ermes is a company which is registered and trades in Cyprus.

The term loan facility is repayable in instalments with the loan being repaid in full by 2011.
Interest rates are based on LIBOR and denominated in sterling.
The RCF is multicurrency with interest rates based on the relevant inter-bank market rate.
Issue costs of 17.1 million, which mainly relate to facility costs, were incurred primarily on utilisation of the credit facilities during 2006 and are being amortised over the term of the facilities at a constant rate based on the committed amount of the term loan.
The amortisation charge relating to the issue costs of the credit facilities for the year ended 1 September 2007 was 3.9 million 2006: 1.0 million.
The amortisation of issue costs during the period to May 2006 relating to the previous senior credit facility was 4.1 million.
i Finance lease obligations In 1988 a number of properties with a market value of 42.7 million were sold to certain banks on 125 year leases at peppercorn rentals.
The Group subsequently entered into full tenant and landlord repairing sub-leases for 125 years.
At the year end the following amounts remained outstanding under the leases: 1 September 2 September 2007 2006 m m Principal 42.7 42.7 Accrued interest 12.6 15.8 Outstanding liability 55.3 58.5 The rentals payable are structured so as to give the lessors a financing return linked to LIBOR in the first 25 years and, in the following 10 years, a LIBOR linked return together with the repayment of capital.
Thereafter, market rentals are payable subject to revision every 5 years.
In the early years, the amounts payable are below LIBOR and in the later years are in excess of LIBOR.
The financing costs are, however, allocated over the 25-year period so as to achieve an annual funding cost which is consistent with LIBOR.
The Group has limited rights up to the 25th year of the leases to vary the terms of the leases to buy out the rental obligations based on the properties original sales proceeds.
The leases are reflected in fixed assets at their cost to the Group.
These property lease obligations are secured by a fixed charge over the corresponding Group properties.
Other lease obligations relate mainly to computer software and vehicles leased under hire purchase contracts.

This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next 12 months.
Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are reclassified to assets held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is crystallised on the balance sheet as inventory.
During the year there were no contracts reclassified to assets held for trading due to cash flow hedges being ineffective.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at 1 September 2007 was 777.5 million 2006: 957.1 million.
The Groups interest rate swaps switch interest from floating rates to fixed rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps has been calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The Groups interest rate swaps mature as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swap 777.5 4.477 6.040 31 May 2008 to 30 November 2011 The net gains and losses on these swaps deferred in equity will reverse through interest in the income statement over the life of the swaps.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting future expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year-end exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of borrowings is approximate to fair value.
Maturity and interest rate profiles of financial assets and liabilities The maturity and interest rate profiles of financial assets and liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from floating to fixed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: 1 September 2007 Non-interest Fixed Floating bearing Total m m m m Sterling financial liabilities: due within one year 75.8 32.8 108.6 due after one year but no more than two years 73.6 29.7 103.3 due after more than two years but no more than five years 613.6 245.8 859.4 due after more than five years 17.1 20.7 37.8 Financial liabilities 780.1 329.0 1,109.1 Sterling: Cash at bank and in hand 52.7 13.7 2.2 68.6 Restricted cash 1.1 1.1 Euro: Cash at bank and in hand 3.7 5.7 0.4 9.8 US Dollar: Cash at bank and in hand 0.7 0.2 0.9 Financial assets 58.2 19.6 2.6 80.4 Debt issue costs of 12.2 million are excluded from the financial liabilities above.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 74 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate borrowings as at 1 September 2007 was 6.4 per cent 2006: 5.9 per cent, with the weighted average time for which rates are fixed being 2.4 years 2006: 2.6 years.
Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores.
Floating rate borrowings have been classified as fixed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the floating rate interest for more than one year.

Borrowing facilities as at 1 September 2007 As at 1 September 2007 the term loan facility was fully drawn and the revolving credit facility of 250 million remains fully available 2006: 218 million.
These facilities expire on 19 April 2011.
Both of these facilities incur commitment fees at market rate.
Market price risk The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of changes chosen reflects the Groups view of changes that are possible over the financial year.
Assuming no changes in the borrowings and interest rate swaps described above, it is estimated that a rise of 1 per cent in interest rates would have reduced pre-tax profits for the financial year ended 1 September 2007 by 2.5 million 2006: 2.2 million.
Similarly, assuming no changes in the volumes of imports described above, it is estimated that a 5 per cent decrease in the value of sterling against relevant foreign currencies would have reduced profits for the year by 1.8 million 2006: 1.1 million before accounting for any offset from renegotiated supplier contracts and alternative sourcing locations.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 75 Section 4 Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 24 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION The Group operates defined benefit type pension schemes, being the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan and the Debenhams Retirement Scheme, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both pension schemes were closed for future service accrual from 31 October 2006.
The closure to future accrual will not affect the pensions of those who have retired or the defined benefits of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006.
Future pension arrangements are provided through a money purchase stakeholder plan or a defined contribution scheme for the employees in the Republic of Ireland.
The Group have agreed to contribute 5.3 million per annum, increasing by RPI from the first of April each year, to fund accrued benefits.
The Group will also fund all administrative expenses incurred by the two pension schemes from 1 November 2006 to the next triannual valuation at 31 March 2008.
Actuarial valuations of the Groups pension schemes using the projected unit basis were carried out at 31 March 2005, and updated as at each relevant year-end for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, by Watson Wyatt Limited, a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries were: 1 September 2 September 3 September 2007 2006 2005 per annum % per annum % per annum % Inflation assumption 3.10 2.90 2.60 General salary and wage increase 3.90 3.90 3.60 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred payments 3.10 2.90 2.60 Pension increase rate 3.10 2.90 2.60 Discount rate 5.95 5.10 5.00 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the year for return over the entire life of the defined benefit obligation.

DRET purchased 70,000 shares on 6 November 2006 at a cost of 1.90 per share.
The cost of the shares held at the year end 0.1 million for DRET and nil million for BELP 2006: 0.5 million and nil million respectively.

An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment will be required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP will comprise an option to receive free shares or nil cost option with performance conditions attached.
Awards under the scheme have been made since May 2006.
The vesting on half of the shares granted is dependent on Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
In accordance with IFRS 2 this is classified as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value.
The vesting of the remaining half of the shares is dependent upon Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three year period when compared to total shareholder return of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
The fair value of the PSP options granted for this proportion of the award is calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation model assuming the inputs shown below: EPS TSR EPS TSR Grant date: 24 Nov 06 24 Nov 06 9 May 06 9 May 06 29 May 07 29 May 07 6 June 06 6 June 06 Number of shares under option no.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 82 Section 4 Financial statements and notes 28 SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED ii Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
These options will normally become exercisable following a three year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.
With the exception of the first grant of options on 9 May 2007, being the date the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange, options were granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of the grant.
The vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on EPS growth, the fair value of the share options has been calculated using a binomial model.
The key assumptions are as follows: Grant date: 29 May 07 24 Nov 06 6 June 06 9 May 06 Number of shares under option no.
443,432 1,587,543 58,870 2,535,972 Expected term years 6666 Share price at grant pence 137.50 198.25 185.00 205.00 Exercise price pence 137.50 198.25 185.00 205.00 Risk free rate: 6.0% 5.5% 4.7% 4.8% Expected volatility 24.0% 24.0% 24.0% 24.0% Expected dividend yield 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Fair value of option pence 31.7 44.8 40.5 45.2 iii Debenhams Employee Option Plan DEOP The DEOP option scheme was introduced on 3 September 2004 options were awarded to certain management of the Group.
The DRET held shares to satisfy the exercise options granted under DEOP.
Options were awarded at the discretion of the Groups Remuneration Committee and were awarded to any employee within the Group at any point in time.
In accordance with the plan rules 50 per cent of the options vested on Debenhams plc admission to the London Stock Exchange.
The remaining options vested on 9 May 2007, 365 days after admission.
No options remain under the plan.
At the date of grant the options were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows: Date of grant Number of employees 327 Expected volatility 15.1% Expected life months 51 Risk free interest rate 4.7% Expected dividends expresses as a dividend yield Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting Fair value per ordinary unit in Baroness Group Limited Partnership 105.75 Fair value per option - equity element per option 0.182 The expected volatility was based on the FTSE All Share Consumer Service Index, which comprised 124 members, over the last three years.
The risk-free interest rate was based on a 4.5 year gilt rate bond at the time the options were issued.
The dividend yield was assumed to be nil as neither the equity component nor the debt element of the underlying option securities were expected to pay out dividends or coupons over their life.
All of the options had an exercise price of 10 pence.
The value of the cash-settled element of the award was the value attributable to the A loan notes under option.
As part of the 2005 Acquisition the A Loan Notes of 12.8 million which were issued to the DRET were immediately repaid in full on 26 May 2005.
On settlement of the options, the option holders received in cash an amount equivalent to the A Loan Notes issued to DRET on the option holders behalf.
The modification resulted in a charge to the income statement that related to the A Loan Notes that were allocated to employees, rather than the total received by the Trust.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 83 Section 4 Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 1 September 2007 28 SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED iv Baroness Employee Limited Partnership BELP In June 2004, senior management of the Group were invited by the Remuneration Committee to invest in the Group through the purchase of units in the BELP.
Management purchased their holding in the Group at fair value and therefore no equity based costs arose in relation to these awards.
The partnership is closed to new entrants.
On Admission to the London Stock Exchange 30 per cent of the shares were distributed to the members.
On 9 May 2007 the remaining 70 per cent, which totalled 12,891,840 were distributed to the members.
The remaining shares held by BELP were transferred to DRET.
There will be no further share transfers or distributions by BELP, which no longer holds shares in the Company.
On 16 May 2005, the Group was reorganised with Debenhams plc being the new parent company of the Group.
The Group reorganisation involved shares being exchanged for shares and loan notes issued by the Company.
In the case of the BELP, a share was exchanged for a share and a C loan note in the Company.
In total, C loan notes of 22.3 million were issued to the BELP.
For accounting purposes, this resulted in the modification of the original equity-settled share-based payment, with the newly created loan note element of the award being treated as a cash-settled share-based payment.
The total value of the cash-settled element of the award is the value attributable to the C Loan Notes of 22.3 million issued to BELP.
