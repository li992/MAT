Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Borrowings continued Short-term loans and overdrafts Current short-term loans mature within the next 12 months and overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Both short-term loans and bank overdrafts are arranged at floating rates of interest and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Credit facilities and arrangements The Group has undrawn committed multi-currency facilities of 236 million 2006 354 million, which mature in September 2009.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
The facilities may only be withdrawn in the event of specified events of default.
In addition, the Group has substantial uncommitted facilities.
At 31 March 2007, a US subsidiary had outstanding external borrowings of US$800 million, the principal amount of which is guaranteed by another Group company by way of credit-linked deposits with a bank of US$680 million and pledged bank securities of US$120 million.
The guarantees result in these borrowings being, in substance, non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowings and deposits are offset in these financial statements.
