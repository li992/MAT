The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is Aor better.
Maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
c Foreign currency risk The group may borrow in appropriate foreign currencies in order to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas.
The foreign exchange exposure on the translation into sterling of the net assets of Aquarion, which are denominated in US dollars, is hedged by US dollar borrowings held.

e Hedges The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk within approved board policies and guidelines.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate exposure under a policy that requires between 85% and 95% of Yorkshire Water Services Limiteds net debt and 70% and 95% of Kelda Group plcs net debt to be held at fixed rates.
At the financial year end the proportions were 57% and 72% respectively.
This will be rebalanced once a review of levels has been completed after the return of cash to shareholders.
Hedging of Eurobond 625m During the year, the group repaid its 7 year 625m 5.25% Eurobond.
The hedging instruments ended on the same date.
The hedge was highly effective, and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or on equity.
In July 1999 the group issued a 7 year 625m 5.25% Eurobond to finance the groups US acquisition and to provide further funds for the non-UK regulated business.
During 2003, 12.1m was bought back, leaving a nominal value outstanding of 612.9m.
The group had no requirement for euros and was exposed to movements in the euro sterling exchange rate which affected the sterling equivalent of the loan.
The exposure occurred at each reporting date and also upon ultimate repayment of the loan.
In order to fully protect the sterling liability the group entered into a number of hedging instruments.
The euro fixed rate liability was swapped in the most part into a floating rate sterling liability i. e. a fair value hedge with a proportion swapped into a fixed rate sterling liability i. e. a cash flow hedge in a series of swaps.
The combination of the series of swaps was considered to be a hedge of the underlying requirement to pay fixed rate euro interest.
The hedging mechanism was a perfect hedge against the liability to pay fixed rate euro interest because the dates of interest payments under the series of swaps were the same as the dates on which interest repayments were due per the original bond.
The fair value of the hedging instrument at 31 March 2007 was an unrealised gain of nil 2006: 27.8m.
The hedge was assessed to be highly effective at 31 March 2006 and an unrealised loss of 4.4m relating to the hedging instrument was included in equity, however it was fully offset by the unrealised gain on the Eurobond.
The instrument was no longer required at 31 March 2007.
Kelda Group plc 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 24.
Financial instruments continued Hedging of interest due under finance leases Yorkshire Water Services Ltd has a number of finance leases with a number of counterparties lasting from inception for periods up to 32 years.
In each instance interest payable under the lease is set once a year in late March or early April based on 12 month LIBOR.
Yorkshire Water Services Ltd is therefore exposed to changes in 12 month LIBOR which could have a material effect on interest costs from year to year and over time.
In order to fix the interest cost on a proportion of its net debt, Yorkshire Water Services Ltd has entered into a number of floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps.
The hedging instrument is a perfect cash flow hedge against changes in 12 month LIBOR for the period of the swaps agreements because the dates of interest payments under the swaps are the same as the dates on which interest is due per the leasing agreements and the nominal value of the swaps that hedge the cost equals the nominal lease value outstanding.
The fair value of the hedging instrument at 31 March 2007 was a 3.5m unrealised loss 2006: 13.5m loss.
The cash flow hedge was assessed to be highly effective at 31 March 2007 and an unrealised loss of 11.3m 2006: 1.8m loss relating to the hedging instrument was included in equity net of deferred tax.
Hedging of investments in foreign operations At each reporting date the group retranslates the dollar value in the UK investment in the US operations into sterling at the closing rate.
To hedge against movements in the US dollar sterling exchange rate the group holds dollar borrowings which hedge $461m of the groups exposure.
Share-based payments Share options The employee share option plans are open to all qualifying employees and provide for an exercise price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 20%.
The options will vest if the employee remains in service for the full duration of the option scheme either three or five years.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.

The options outstanding at 31 March 2007 had a weighted average exercise price of 5.36 2006: 4.50, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.3 years 2006: 2.5 years.
The fair value of the share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes statistical model.

Kelda Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 73 Notes to the group accounts Year ended 31 March 2007 25.
Share-based payments continued Long term incentive plan LTIP Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan have two separate vesting conditions, both of which are dependent on market-based conditions.
The market-based conditions of the award are taken into account in valuing the award at the grant date by applying the probability that the LTIPs will vest to the current market price of the groups shares.
At each subsequent balance sheet date the group revises its estimate of the number of employees who will receive awards.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
70% of the full value of the LTIPs will vest based on the companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the performance period three years.
The groups share performance will be compared to that of six other UK water companies.
At the end of the performance period the TSR of all seven companies will be calculated, and the results ranked.
Of the 70%, 100% will vest if the group is ranked first, 60% if the group is ranked second and 20% if the group is ranked third.
Otherwise none of the 70% will vest.
For the remaining 30%, the groups TSR will be compared to the constituents of the FTSE 350 index.
If the group is in the top 20%, 100% will vest, if the group is at the median, 30% will vest, but if the company is ranked below, none will vest.
