The most recent actuarial valuation of the NWPS was at 31 December 2004.
At that date the market value of assets amounted to 520 million.
The valuation also took account of debt on the employer payments in respect of the withdrawal of two participating employers and added 10 million to the asset value.
The 2004 valuation disclosed that the combined value of the assets represented 97.6% of the value of the accrued liabilities.

The capital injections cover: employers contributions, and the strain on the fund arising from ill-health retirements, for the five years commencing 1 January 2006: and employee contributions for members electing to participate in a salary sacrifice arrangement effective for the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 December 2010.
For the period 1 January 2006 to 31 March 2006, all members continued to pay contributions to the NWPS.
Members electing not to join the salary sacrifice arrangement continue to pay contributions to the NWPS from 1 April 2006.
In addition, the employers have agreed to pay any savings in employer national insurance contributions arising from this arrangement into the NWPS and this amounts to 0.3 million per annum.
The employers proposals were accepted by the NWPS Trustee.
The Group also contributes to a defined contribution scheme, the Northumbrian Water Group Personal Pension Plan NWGPPP.
Members and employers contribute 3% and 6% of salary respectively.
The NWGPPP is provided by an insurance company and members have their own individual policy.
There were 248 contributing members at 31 March 2007 2006: 258.
The Group made contributions amounting to 0.3 million 2006: 0.3 million to the defined contribution pension scheme.

The Group made contributions amounting to 0.5 million 2006: 0.5 million to the defined benefit pension scheme.
Sensitivity to key assumptions: IAS 1 requires disclosure of the sensitivity of the results to the methods and assumptions used.
The costs of a pension arrangement require estimates regarding future experience.
The financial assumptions used for IAS 19 reporting are the responsibility of the directors of the Company.
These assumptions reflect market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Changes in market conditions which result in changes in the net discount rate essentially the difference between the discount rate and the assumed rates of increases of salaries, deferred pension revaluation or pensions in payment, can have a significant effect on the value of the liabilities reported.
A reduction in the net discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities, as a higher value is placed on benefits paid in the future.
A rise in the net discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.
The overall effect of a change in the net discount rate of 0.1% would change the liabilities by around 25 million.
There is also uncertainty around life expectancy for the UK population.
The value of current and future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.
