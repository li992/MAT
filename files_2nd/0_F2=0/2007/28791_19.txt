OTHER CURRENT ASSETS CONTINUED Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are its investment portfolio, bank balances and cash and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to its financial assets.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk and its exposure is spread over a number of counterparties.
DEFERRED TAX ASSET The movement on deferred tax during the year is shown below: Year ended 31 March 2007 Year ended 31 March 2006 Group Company Group Company million million million million Balance at start of year 2.4 1.9 8.7 7.1 Credit charge to capital reserve 0.7 6.9 5.9 Credit charge to revenue reserve 0.1 0.3 0.6 0.7 Balance at end of year 2.3 2.9 2.4 1.9 Analysis of deferred tax asset: Unutilised tax losses 2.0 1.8 13.9 13.6 Deferred management fees 1.2 1.2 2.1 2.1 Long-term incentive plan 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Pension contributions 0.3 0.5 Other timing differences 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 Unrealised profit on offshore funds 0.8 0.1 13.7 13.7 Accelerated capital allowances 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.7 Deferred tax re retirement benefit asset 0.5 0.4 Balance at end of year 2.3 2.9 2.4 1.9 The Group has revenue tax losses of 5.9 million 31 March 2006: 45.2 million which are available for offset against future taxable profits including profits on offshore hedge funds.
The unrealised profits on such funds amounted to 2.8 million as at 31 March 2007 31 March 2006: 45.8 million.
The Group has investments in several offshore hedge funds which have an aggregate market value of 100.2 million as at 31 March 2007.
The tax cost of these investments was 101.4 million and the Company considers that the taxable profits which will be subsequently generated by the realisation of these investments will be greater than the amount of its revenue tax losses.
Accordingly, the Company considers that it is appropriate to recognise the deferred tax asset in its financial statements.
The Finance Bill 2007 contains a provision to the effect that the rate of corporation tax will be reduced by 2% to 28% from 1 April 2008.
This proposed reduction in the corporation tax rate will not have a material impact on the Groups deferred tax asset as at 31 March 2007.
The dealing subsidiary has tax losses amounting to 58.7 million at 31 March 2007 31 March 2006: 28.9 million.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses because of uncertainty as to the timing and magnitude of future taxable profits arising from the same trade.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of potential deferred tax on temporary timing differences associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 0.6 million 31 March 2006: 0.6 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Indemnity Provision In 1991 the Company acquired an investment in Newmont Mining and at the same time effected a disposal of its indirect interest in Cavenham Forest Industries Inc CFI.
As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2007 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment Provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been computed by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
As at 31 March 2006, 0.3 million of this provision related to the costs of certain individuals seconded from First Arrow Investment Management Limited: this provision was reversed during the current year.
Litigation The litigation involving H-G Holdings Inc was discontinued and dismissed with prejudice in October 2006 and the Company did not incur any material costs in respect of these proceedings.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 0.2 million as at 31 March 2007 31 March 2006: 0.3 million.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Long-term Incentive Plan This provision represents amounts accrued under a long-term incentive arrangement structured in the form of a Share Appreciation Rights Plan SAR.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, certain Directors and employees are entitled to a bonus calculated by reference to a notional number of shares in the Company.
The bonus amount payable would be equal to the increase, since the date of grant of the relevant SARs, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares, provided the relevant performance conditions are met: the provision also includes the corresponding employers national insurance liability.
The SAR can be exercised between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The provision can be analysed by reference to the date of grant of the relevant SARs as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 million million Date of grant 26 March 2003 1.9 1.9 31 March 2003 0.2 0.5 12 August 2003 0.4 25 March 2004 0.1 0.2 30 March 2005 0.2 0.2 19 July 2005 0.7 0.7 31 August 2005 0.3 0.3 7 October 2005 15 March 2006 0.1 29 December 2006 15 March 2007 0.3 Intrinsic value of all SARs 3.7 4.3 IFRS 2 adjustment to provision 0.1 0.9 Carrying amount of SAR provision 3.8 3.4 Intrinsic value of those SARs which had vested as at 31 March 2.2 2.4 The Company has used a binomial option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the SARs.
The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 18%, dividends of 3.1p per share per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate of 5.4%.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITCPs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Long-term Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 30.
To allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised three and a half years after the relevant vesting dates.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Company granted 397,876 SARs 31 March 2006: 721,770 and the weighted average fair value of those SARs was 3.19 31 March 2006: 3.41.
The Company recognised total expenses of 0.9 million 31 March 2006: 7.2 million arising from the SAR long-term incentive plan.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives: cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group to manage market risks and currency risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises from uncertainty about the future value of the Groups investments.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions as the result of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
At the same time, the risk that the value of a financial instrument might change as a result of changes in market prices is one that is fundamental to the Groups objective, which is to deliver long-term capital growth while preserving shareholders capital.
The Groups investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward in order to achieve the Groups objective.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when appropriate.
Short-term exposure to movements in exchange rates, caused by the buying and selling of investments for future settlement, is mitigated through entering into forward contracts.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements as a substantial proportion of the Groups assets and liabilities is denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular foreign currencies.
These contracts are used principally for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US Dollar and Euro investments is effectively hedged by way of the Companys long-term borrowings denominated in those currencies.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations and take appropriate action.
Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups investments in quoted and unquoted companies.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Credit and Investment Risk The majority of the Groups assets comprise financial assets.
Substantially all of the assets are subject to credit or investment risk.
Exposure to any one entity is monitored by the executive Directors and senior management.
The Company complies with the requirement of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
Investments in unquoted companies are by their nature subject to potential credit losses.
Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions, each of whose credit rating is assessed.
The credit risk from other instruments such as derivatives is assessed on a case by case basis.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity Risk The Group has significant investments in unquoted companies and private equity partnerships which are inherently illiquid.
The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet its contractual commitments.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out borrowings, both short and long-term.
Currency exposure A significant proportion of the Groups net assets is denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The currency exposure of the Groups net assets at the year end is set out below: Group Company 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 2007 2006 Currency million million million million Sterling 800.3 405.1 1,045.0 746.5 US Dollar 145.1 321.8 155.9 387.3 Euro 276.0 115.8 139.7 111.7 Japanese Yen 143.3 289.9 80.2 90.9 Canadian Dollar 73.4 55.7 70.1 55.7 Swiss Franc 57.8 79.7 9.9 30.7 Singapore Dollar 66.7 57.8 14.0 4.3 Taiwan Dollar 0.8 58.0 0.8 4.8 Other 72.2 150.9 70.0 98.0 1,635.6 1,534.7 1,585.6 1,529.9 The amounts shown above take into account the effect of forward currency contracts and other derivatives entered into.
Net fair values of derivative financial instruments The net fair values of derivatives and designated cash flow hedges at the balance sheet date were: Group Company 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 2007 2006 million million million million Contracts with positive fair values: Interest rate swap cash flow hedge 5.4 4.1 5.4 4.1 Forward exchange currency contracts 1.2 1.8 Put options-market indices 0.1 2.6 Call options-market indices 9.0 14.2 9.0 14.2 Currency options 0.2 Contracts with negative fair values: Forward exchange currency contracts 8.8 9.5 7.2 9.1 Credit default swap 1.4 Index futures 7.4 5.5 Equity-linked swap 0.9 Details of the interest rate swap are disclosed in Note 18.
The gain of 5.4 million 31 March 2006: 4.1 million has been deferred in equity and this gain will reverse in the income statement during the next five years being the life of the swap.
The fair value of the swap is recognised as a non-current asset in the balance sheet.
The fair value of securities sold short by the dealing subsidiary as at 31 March 2007 amounted to 2.2 million 31 March 2006: 9.5 million.
The losses which may be incurred on a short sale are theoretically unlimited, whereas losses from purchases cannot exceed the total amount invested.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and the liability simultaneously.

In the case of long-term borrowings due in more than one year, for disclosure purposes the fair values have been estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Details of the maturity dates of the long-term borrowings are set out in Note 18.

PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Group has adopted the revised version of International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method.
The employer contribution rate to the Scheme for the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 December 2005 was 35% of pensionable salaries and the rate was increased to 47% for the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 March 2006.
The contribution rate remained at 47% during the year ended 31 March 2007.
A special contribution of 3.4 million was made in March 2005 to extinguish the deficit in the Scheme at that time.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase scheme was 20% of pensionable salary up to 31 December 2005 and the funding of this section of the Scheme was discontinued thereafter by mutual agreement.
No changes have been made to these funding rates to date.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 March 2008 will be 0.2 million 31 March 2007: 0.2 million.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
