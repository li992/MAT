This rate is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The rate applied during the year was in the region of 4.2 per cent depending on exact grant date.
Reconciliations of option movements over the year to 31 March 2007 for each class of options are shown below.
Executive Share Option Plan The Executive Share Option Plan is open to senior executives of the Group.
Options are granted at a price equal to the average market price of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceeding the date of grant with a performance condition based on the acheivement of an earning per share growth target.
The performance condition relates to the acheivement over three years of three per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the retail price index.
If this condition is not met at the end of the performance period the options will lapse.
For grants of options before April 2004 retesting of the performance target will be allowed twice, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
A pre vesting forfeiture rate of 5 per cent per annum has been assumed.
