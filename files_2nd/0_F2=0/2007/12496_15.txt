For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume issue of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
At 28 January 2007 and 29 January 2006, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Scheme had not been met and, consequently, the shares in question are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Reconciliations of earnings and the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below.

The recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations, which were performed for the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK and BuckHickman, based on data available at the mid-point of the financial year, were as follows: Sales growth for the current year was based on internal forecasts with growth in the five subsequent years broadly in line with historic UK GDP and a terminal growth rate of 2.3%.
Gross margins were projected based on recent trends.
A market risk premium, of 4.5%, was used in calculating the weighted average cost of capital.
Forecast cash flows have been prepared for a period of five years.
From the second year onwards, the rate of growth used does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the industry in which the business operates.
The cash flows that these projections produce have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 13.9%.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test or in respect of goodwill on other acquisitions.

The fair value of the debt element is established on issue of the shares, based on the discounted cashflows of the instrument to the date of maturity and is then increased each year on a straight line basis through the income statement in order to arrive at the redemption amount payable on maturity of the shares.
PREMIER FARNELL PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOUNTS 2007 64 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 15 continued The movement in the debt and equity elements during the year is as follows: Equity Debt element element m m At 29 January 2006 19.9 110.2 Premium on redemption 1.4 Purchase of preference shares 1.5 8.4 Exchange movement 0.1 At 28 January 2007 18.4 103.1 During the year the Company purchased and cancelled 565,000 of its preference shares at a total cash cost of 8.4 million.
Based on the book value and fair value of the instrument at the date of purchase, the financial liability element of the preference shares was reduced by 8.4 million and the equity element by 1.5 million.
A gain of 0.3 million was recognised in the income statement being the difference between the book value and fair value of the financial liability element at the date of purchase.
The gain arising from the difference between the book value and fair value of the equity element of 1.2 million was recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A deferred tax credit of 0.3 million arose which is recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
A transfer from retained earnings of 0.6 million to non-distributable reserves was made in order to maintain the legal nominal value of share capital.
At 28 January 2007, the preference shares comprised 149,478 2006: 161,993 US$1.35 cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the US preference shares and 6,860,743 2006: 7,413,228 89.2p cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the sterling preference shares and, together with the US preference shares, the preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are as follows: 1 Currency Holders of preference shares are entitled to receive a preferential dividend, a distribution on a winding up and a payment on redemption.
Holders of US preference shares receive such payments in US dollars.
Holders of sterling preference shares receive such payments in sterling.
2 Changeover A holder of US preference shares may serve notice on the Company requiring that some or all of their US preference shares be changed to sterling preference shares.
3 Income a Each holder has a right to receive a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of US$1.35 per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and at the rate of 89.2p per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares.
Dividends on the preference shares are payable half-yearly in arrears in equal amounts, on 26 January and 26 July.
b The fixed cumulative preferential dividends payable in respect of the preference shares are paid in priority to any dividend payable to the holders of ordinary shares and in priority to or pari passu with the holders of any other class of preference shares in the capital of the Company.
c If a holder of US preference shares has elected to changeover his US preference shares to sterling preference shares then the fixed cumulative preferential dividend and any arrears payable after the changeover date will be paid at the sterling rate set out above.
4 Conversion a Each holder of preference shares is entitled to convert all or any of his fully paid preference shares into fully paid ordinary shares at the rate of 10.3432p in nominal amount of ordinary share capital for every 1 in nominal amount of preference share capital so converted the conversion rate.
b The preference shares may be converted on any date at the option of the holder on and from the date of issue up to and including 22 April 2016. c If at any time 75% or more of all the preference shares have been converted into ordinary shares but assuming, for this purpose only, that any preference shares which have been converted into ordinary shares pursuant to the special conversion right made available in 2002 had never been issued or converted, the Company may give written notice to the remaining holders of preference shares to convert the remaining preference shares into ordinary shares.
d The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment if, inter alia, the Company makes an issue of ordinary shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, a rights issue or another offer to ordinary shareholders or if there is a change of control in the Company following a take-over offer or if a capital distribution is made.
5 Redemption The Company shall subject to any statutory restrictions on 29 April 2016 redeem all the US preference shares in issue at US$25 for every 1 of nominal value and all the sterling preference shares in issue at 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value.
6 Voting Each preference share entitles the holder to receive notice of but not to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company save in limited circumstances.
Subject to being entitled to vote on any resolution, each holder of preference shares has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every such holder has one vote for every ordinary share to which he would be entitled on conversion of his preference shares.
7 Winding up Subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions, on a return of capital on a winding-up of the Company the assets available for distribution will be applied, first, in paying to each holder of a preference share any arrears and accruals of the preferential dividend: second, in repaying US$25 for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares: third, in repaying the capital paid up on each ordinary share: and fourth, in distributing the remainder rateably among the members of the Company according to the amounts paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company, each preference share being treated for this purpose as if converted at the conversion rate applicable into fully paid ordinary shares immediately prior to the commencement of the winding-up.

This comprised a restructuring of the sales and logistics operations under which branches will focus solely on delivering sales and customer service by relinquishing responsibility for procurement, local inventory and logistics.
These activities have been streamlined through the creation of a number of regional distribution centres, supported by the business national distribution centre in Coventry.
The restructuring also included a review of the profitability of customer contracts and the centralisation of procurement.
During the year 2.7 million of the provision was utilised relating primarily to 1.6 million of severance costs and 0.5 million of consultancy costs.
It is anticipated that the balance at the end of the year will be utilised in the first half of 2008.
Dilapidation costs Provision for dilapidation costs represents the estimated cost of dilapidation work on leased properties prior to the properties being vacated at the end of their lease term.
The non-current element is expected to be incurred over the period to 2020.
19 Financial instruments The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks in the normal course of business including credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Credit risk The Group has a customer credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Investments are allowed only in short-term instruments and only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings.
Given the high credit quality of counterparties with whom the Group has investments, the Directors do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At 28 January 2007 and 29 January 2006 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset included in the balance sheet.
Hedging interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that there is an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are entered into, where necessary, to achieve this appropriate mix.
At 28 January 2007 the Group was not party to any interest rate swaps 29 January 2006: nil.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the euro and US dollar.
The Group hedges significant foreign currency exposures in respect of forecast sales and purchases of inventory through foreign exchange contracts.
All such forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cashflow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movements in exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long-term investments in overseas assets.
Estimation of fair values The main methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Derivatives: forward exchange contracts are marked to market using listed market prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings: fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cashflows.
Convertible redeemable preference shares: fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Trade and other receivables payables: the notional amount for trade receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year are deemed to reflect their fair value.
PREMIER FARNELL PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOUNTS 2007 67 Note 19 continued Net fair value of derivative financial instruments The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast trading transactions as cashflow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted trading transactions at 28 January 2007 was 0.1 million 29 January 2006: 0.2 million, which was reflected in a hedging reserve at that date.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups US dollar denominated private placement notes totalling $225 million and unsecured loans of $63 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its US subsidiaries.
The Groups euro denominated unsecured loans of 129 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its European Union member subsidiaries.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 28 January 2007 was 144.0 million 29 January 2006: 212.9 million and the fair value of the euro borrowings was 19.1 million 29 January 2006: 19.9 million.
A foreign exchange gain of 19.4 million 29 January 2006: loss of 12.4 million was recognised in equity during the year on translation of these loans to pounds sterling.
Fair value of long-term borrowings and preference shares The book and fair values of the Groups long-term borrowings and preference shares as at 28 January 2007 were as follows: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2007 2007 2006 2006 m m m m Long-term borrowings 199.3 196.6 167.6 165.2 Preference shares 121.5 100.0 130.1 116.3 The book value of the preference shares at 28 January 2007 comprises the equity element of 18.4 million 2006: 19.9 million and the debt element of 103.1 million 2006: 110.2 million.

b Post-retirement medical benefits In the US, the Group provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits to certain US employees.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used to account for pension obligations.
The charge for the year was 0.7 million 2006: 0.6 million and the balance sheet obligation at 28 January 2007 amounted to 7.4 million 2006: 7.1 million.
The disclosures relating to post-retirement medical benefits are based on an actuarial valuation performed by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Actuaries and Pension Consultants, as at 28 January 2007.
The principal assumptions were as follows: 2007 2006 % % Discount rate 6.0 5.5 Medical inflation 5.0 5.0 Life expectancy of a 60 year old male current retiree 24 yrs 22 yrs Life expectancy of a 60 year old male future retiree 25 yrs 22 yrs The assumed long-term rate of medical inflation is 5.0% per annum.
In 2007, the initial rate has been assumed to be 10.0% which is assumed to reduce to the long-term rate at 0.5% per annum over ten years.
In 2006, the initial rate was 9.0% assumed to reduce to the long-term rate at 0.5% per annum over eight years.
