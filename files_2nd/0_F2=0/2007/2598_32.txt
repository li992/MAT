profit Cap, a leading national supplier of personal protection equipment in Brazil, was acquired on 18 February 2008.
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2007 was R$118m.
Acquisition accounting for Gnter Guest Supplies and profit Cap was not finalised prior to approval of these consolidated financial statements due to the short timeframe involved.
Acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
All 2007 acquisitions, together with the 2008 acquisitions, involved the purchase of 100% of the acquirees share capital or, as the case may be, all of the relevant assets of the businesses acquired.
Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At the end of the year, the allocation period for the acquisitions completed during 2007 remained open for all acquisitions except Tec Products and Westgate and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The net impact on acquired net assets reported in 2006 from these adjustments was 0.8m.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2006 has not been restated for these adjustments as they are not considered material.
The consideration for the acquisitions has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
