In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests were performed based on internal valuations of each cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount of goodwill attaching to cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flows.
Those calculations use cash flows based on three-year business plans and forecasts and a perpetual growth rate of five per cent 2006: five per cent thereafter, discounted at the Groups estimated weighted average cost of capital of 12.0 per cent 2006: 9.5 per cent.
As at 31 December 2007, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 20.6m 2006: 17.8m is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 119.0m arising on the acquisition of Mowlem plc is in line with the expected discounted cash flows arising from the intangible asset and will be 79 per cent complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.

The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem plc on 23 February 2006 whereby the consideration included the issue of 66.2m Carillion shares.
The Group has credited the merger reserve as permitted by The Companies Act 1985 and prior year information has been restated accordingly.
The 18.6m transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem acquisition.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows.

Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to purchase shares in the entity.
Full details of each option scheme can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 55.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to grants of options before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The terms and conditions of option schemes within the scope of IFRS 2 are as follows, whereby all options are settled by physical delivery of shares.

The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes model in respect of the ESOS, Sharesave and LEAP and a TSR model in respect of LTIP using the following assumptions.

The estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest ignores the possibility that market conditions will or will not be achieved given that these market conditions are already included in the fair value of the options.

Guarantees and contingent liabilities continued Group Carillion JM Limited CJM formerly Mowlem has been the subject of the Office of Fair Tradings OFT on-going investigation of cover pricing in the construction industry under The Competition Act 1988.
The investigation relates to CJMs construction business and relates entirely to periods prior to CJMs acquisition.
No other member of the Group has been subject to the investigation.
CJM has been co-operating fully with the OFT.
Any fine ultimately arising would be subject to the statutory maximum financial penalty of 10 per cent of world wide revenue of the undertaking concerned in the business year prior to the infringement.
Group management believes that it is extremely unlikely that any fine that is imposed will approach this amount.
Carillion also does not believe that customers have suffered any loss or damage as a result of any actions taken by CJM.
Guarantees and counter indemnities have been given to financial institutions in respect of the provision of performance and other contract-related bonds that are issued in the normal course of business.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
There are no contingent liabilities of Joint Ventures for which the Group is contingently liable.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10m equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 50 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
A general weakening of the Canadian Dollar specifically a one per cent rise in the Sterling:Canadian Dollar rate would have a nil impact on reported profit and an increase of 0.1m in equity.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest-bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowing that arose from the acquisition of Mowlem plc, on-going working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowing for hedging net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in respect of US Dollar denominated borrowings interest rates would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.1m, in respect of Canadian Dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.2m, and in respect of Sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 1.1m.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium-term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
94 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
2007 2006 m m Provision as at 1 January 11.3 11.1 Increase in provision during the year 4.9 3.8 Provision utilised during the year 1.7 3.0 Provision released during the year 1.1 0.6 Provision as at 31 December 13.4 11.3 There are 26.2m of trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 31 December 2007 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments 2007 2006 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward foreign currency contracts 0.7 0.8 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Private Public Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range spanning up until September 2035.
At 31 December 2007 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 34.5m 2006: 27.8m of which 23.0m 2006: 13.7m and the related deferred tax asset of 6.9m 2006: 4.1m has been recognised in the hedging reserve.

The foreign exchange loss of 2.7m 2006: gain of 4.1m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.

In December 2007, the Group disposed of equity investments in three Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities.
The disposal generated cash consideration of 21.5m after deducting disposal costs of 50,000 and a non-operating profit of 23.6m.
Disposals in 2006 During the acquisition of Mowlem plc, certain businesses were identified as being non-core operations for disposal.
In addition, there were a number of businesses which had been identified as available for sale by Mowlem plc prior to acquisition.
In the post-acquisition period the Group disposed of the following Mowlem plc businesses: Edgar Allen Limited Charter Builders Ltd Mowlem Environmental Sciences Group Barclay Mowlem Limited Carillion Energy Limited formerly Mowlem Energy Limited Carillion Utility Services Limited formerly Mowlem Utility Services Limited These businesses were included in the acquisition balance sheet of Mowlem plc as assets and liabilities held for sale and were therefore carried at fair value, which represents proceeds on disposal less costs to sell.
These fair values were realised on subsequent disposal and consequently no profit or loss has arisen.
The cash effect has been reflected in the Group cash flow statement as follows.
m Consideration received net of disposal costs paid 53.5 Cash in businesses disposed of 23.1 Net cash inflow from disposal of businesses 30.4 In September 2006, the Group disposed of a portfolio of equity investments in Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities.
The disposal generated cash consideration of 46.7m after deducting disposal costs of 0.4m and a non-operating profit of 25.6m.
The Group also disposed of equity interests in two small non-PPP jointly controlled entities for a total consideration of 0.6m, generating a profit of 0.4m.

IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were.
31 December 2007 31 December 2006 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 4.90% 3.20% 4.25% 3.00% 1 Rate of increase in pensions 3.40% 2.20% 3.00% 2.00% Inflation rate 3.40% 2.20% 3.00% 2.00% Discount rate 5.60% 5.55% 5.00% 5.20% 1 Where schemes have adopted the new 2.5 per cent per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment, the assumption is 2.4 per cent per annum 2006: 1.9 per cent rather than the higher amount shown above.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation.
All the schemes, except the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary.
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specific assumptions based on industry experience.
Section 05 Financial statements 103 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 32.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme and the Mowlem 1993 Scheme adopted the PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 years table for non-retired members mortality and the PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 years for retired members mortality at the last valuation.
The previous bases were PA92 Base 3 years and PA92 Base 1 year respectively.
The life expectancies for a male aged 65 are shown below.
2007 2006 PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 yrs PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 years Non-retired members 21.3 years 21.3 years PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 yrs PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 years Retired members 19.7 years 19.7 years The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefits under local GAAP, CICA 3461.
The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation to the Post Retirement Benefit Plan.
The immediate trend rate is 10 per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of five per cent per annum 2013.
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by 0.6m and the total service cost by 0.1m.
The decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by 0.5m and total service cost by nil.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long-term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the Actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long-term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense as permitted under IAS 19.
The IAS 19 position for the schemes is as follows.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of 85.2m and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense before 1 January 2004.
106 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews estimated final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out-turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: Expected return on plan assets Inflation rate Mortality Discount rate Salary and pensions increases Details of the assumptions used are included in note 32.
Post-balance sheet events On 12 February 2008, the Company acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Alfred McAlpine plc for a total consideration of 554.5m.
The total consideration was satisfied by the issue of 112.9m Carillion plc shares valued at the quoted mid-market price at the close of business on the day preceding the effective date of acquisition of 337.75p and 171.7m in cash and 1.3m of loan notes.
In addition, attributable costs are estimated to be 9.2m.
The acquisition has had no impact on reported profit during 2007.
Due to the short period of time that Alfred McAlpine plc has been within the Groups ownership prior to the approval of these financial statements, it has not been possible to determine the fair value of the business acquired.
The fair value will be determined prior to the announcement of the 2008 interim results and full disclosure will be made in the 2008 interim financial statements.
