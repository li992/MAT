The value in use calculation requires an estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.

Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group comprises equity attributable to equity holders of Balfour Beatty plc consisting of issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 28 and 29, preference shares as disclosed in Note 28, and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in Note 24.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new shares and buy-back of existing shares and incurring new borrowings or repaying existing borrowings.
The Groups policy is to carry no significant debt, other than the non-recourse borrowings of companies engaged in PFI PPP projects and infrastructure investments.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2006.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse impact of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury communicates with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on contracting activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company: forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the Groups investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures: interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on PFI PPP concessions.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and how it manages those risks from 2006. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro, US and Hong Kong dollars.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Group Treasury, on behalf of operating companies, enters into forward contracts to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above pre-set materiality levels determined by the Finance Director whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified.
Due to the financial immateriality of these risks hedge accounting is not applied to these transactions.
Details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures are set out on page 48.
The notional principal amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions at 31 December 2007 was 8m 2006: 13m.
The period during which the cash flows are expected to occur is up to two years.
This will impact the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk which is managed by matching approximately 90% of significant net assets of the Groups foreign operations in currencies other than sterling, primarily through forward contracts.
The impact of a 5% strengthening weakening in US dollar exchange rates against sterling would be an 11m 2006: 3m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in US dollars.
The effect of a 5% strengthening weakening in Hong Kong dollar exchange rates against sterling would be a 2m 2006: 1m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in Hong Kong dollars.
The effect of a 3% strengthening weakening in Euro exchange rates against sterling would be a 1m 2006: 1m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in Euros.
These movements would be taken directly to equity.
However, these effects would be more than compensated by opposing gains losses in the fair value of the net assets denominated in foreign currencies for which the financial instruments were taken out.
The percentage change applied to each currency is based on the average movement in the previous five reporting periods.
The notional principal amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations at 31 December 2007 was 314m 2006: 147m.
The gains and losses in equity on hedges of net investments in foreign operations will be released to the income statement on the disposal of the underlying net investment.
Our accounts 51 Balfour Beatty plc Directors report and accounts 2007 21 Financial instruments continued ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups PFI PPP concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Group policy is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swaps, to hedge the cash flow variability of the interest.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the year end is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable year end yield curve.
The net impact of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
During 2007 and 2006, the Groups PFI PPP borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding PFI PPP subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2007 were 68m 2006: 22m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 26 years.
At 31 December 2007, the fixed interest rates range from 4.565% to 5.118% 2006: 4.565% to 5.055% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 10m 2006: 1m increase decrease in amounts taken directly by the Group to equity.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its PFI PPP subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and non-PFI PPP borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 1m 2006: 1m increase decrease in the Groups net investment income.
iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its PFI PPP concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
To the extent that inflation differs from the index used, the Group is exposed to a price risk.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, only independently rated counterparties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A are accepted.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and no losses are expected from non-performance by these counterparties.
For trade and other receivables ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Groups most significant customers are public or quasi public sector entities which have high credit ratings due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 24.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out above.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial assets and liabilities traded in active markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods such as estimated discounted cash flows and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which interest bearing financial assets are held would lead to a 2m 2006: 2m decrease increase in the Companys investment income.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to equity.
b Credit risk The additional credit risk that the Company bears is in respect of amounts due from subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due at the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial asset recorded in the financial statements.

The Directors consider that the carrying values of current trade and other receivables approximate their fair values.
The fair value of non-current trade and other receivables amounts to 71m 2006: 50m and has been determined by discounting future cash flows using yield curves and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
It is Group policy that forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into as soon as a foreign currency trade receivable is identified.

Following the acquisition of Balfour Beatty Construction Group Inc, 110m of these losses were recognised, together with 24m of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences.
Of the remaining losses, 14m 2006: 140m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2019.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 220m 2006: 130m and for joint ventures and associates is 13m 2006: 11m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking independent actuarial advice.
Details of the IAS 19 valuations are set out in 26.1 below.
Details of the last actuarial valuations and reviews and the assumptions used by the actuaries are set out in 26.2 below.
26.1 IAS 19 valuations The latest actuarial funding valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes have been updated by the actuaries to 31 December 2007 on the basis prescribed by IAS 19.
In particular, scheme liabilities have been discounted using the rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond rather than the expected rate of return on the assets in the scheme used in the funding valuations.
On 5 April 2007 the Birse Group Retirement Benefit Scheme Birse scheme was merged with the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF.
Other than the mortality assumptions set out in 26.2, the principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Pension Pension Mansell Birse Fund Scheme schemes Fund Scheme schemes scheme 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 2006 % % % % % % % Inflation rate 3.35 3.35 3.35 3.10 3.10 3.10 3.10 Discount rate 5.85 5.85 5.85 5.15 5.15 5.15 5.15 Future salary increases 4.85 4.85 4.85 4.60 4.60 4.60 4.60 Future pension increases 3.35 3.35 3.35 3.10 3.10 3.10 3.10 Expected return on plan assets 6.53 7.45 6.83 6.35 7.30 6.79 7.36 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Other Pension Pension Mansell Birse Other Fund Scheme schemes schemes Total Fund Scheme schemes scheme schemes Total 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006 m m m m m m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 2,036 164 207 12 2,419 1,876 158 210 94 11 2,349 Fair value of plan assets 1,796 160 191 11 2,158 1,688 150 177 62 10 2,087 Deficit 240 4 16 1 261 188 8 33 32 1 262 Present value of unfunded obligations 25 25 26 26 Liability in the balance sheet 240 4 16 26 286 188 8 33 32 27 288 Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants.

The rates of return for each class were determined as follows: equities and property: the rate adopted is consistent with the median assumption used in the actuarys asset modelling work as at 31 December: bonds: the overall rate has been set to reflect the yields available on the gilts and corporate bond holdings held at 31 December: cash and other net current assets: this class is mostly made up of cash holdings and the rate adopted reflects current short-term returns on such deposits.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the principal schemes during 2008 is 75m.
Contributions paid in 2007 for the principal schemes were 31m 2006: 24m for the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, 4m 2006: 2m for the Railways Pension Scheme and 9m 2006: 9m for the Mansell schemes.
The Railways Pension Scheme is a shared cost scheme.
Accordingly the deficit shown above assumes that the Group will obtain economic benefit from, or be required to finance, only a proportion of the surplus or deficit in the Balfour Beatty section of the scheme.
This proportion has been based on the apportionment of the surplus which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and Rules and Trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.

Due to the size of the membership of the BBPF 41,390 members at 31 December 2007 the schemes actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and is able to make statistically credible comparisons of this experience with the mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables.
The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
As a result of these reviews the Group is able to adopt with a measure of confidence consistent mortality assumptions for its IAS 19 valuations across its various defined benefit schemes.
The reviews suggest continuing improvements in life expectancy and therefore the mortality assumptions have been strengthened compared with the last formal funding valuations and 31 December 2006 valuation reviews.
A valuation is being carried out by the actuary as at 31 March 2007.
Although not yet finalised, the assumptions are not expected to materially differ from those shown below.
The mortality tables adopted for the 2007 IAS 19 valuations and reviews of the funding valuations are the 1992 series calendar year 2007 tables, with future improvements from 2007 in line with those applicable to each members year of birth under the medium cohort effect.
The mortality tables adopted for the 2006 IAS 19 valuations and reviews of funding valuations were also based on the 1992 series CMI tables, as shown below: 2007 2006 Average life Average life expectancy expectancy at 65 years at 65 years of age of age Members in receipt of a pension Male 20.2 years 18.4 years Female 23.3 years 21.3 years Members not yet in receipt of a pension current age 50 Male 21.2 years 20.0 years Female 24.2 years 22.9 years Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme.
The last formal valuation of this defined benefit scheme was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 December 2004 using the projected unit method and disclosed that the market value of the schemes assets represented 92.4% of the benefits of which, being a shared cost scheme, the economic cost to the Group is circa 60% as represented in the schemes assets and liabilities shown below.
Mansell plc operates two funded defined benefit schemes, the Mansell plc Pension Scheme and the Hall & Tawse Retirement Benefit Plan Mansell schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Mansell plc Pension Scheme, which was closed to new members from 31 December 2001, was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 July 2005 using the projected unit method.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets represented 78.0% of the benefits that had accrued to members on an ongoing funding basis.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Hall & Tawse Retirement Benefit Plan, which was closed to new members from 1 July 1998, was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit method.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets represented 79.0% of the benefits that had accrued to members on an ongoing funding basis.
64 Balfour Beatty plc Directors report and accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 26 Retirement benefit obligations continued The Groups actuaries have reviewed the funding valuations of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, the Railways Pension Scheme and the Mansell schemes at 31 December 2007.
The results of these reviews along with the assumptions used by the actuaries are set out below together with comparatives at 31 December 2006.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenditure relating to this fund are allocated to Group companies participating in the scheme in proportion to pensionable payroll for the year.

Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 112m at 31 December 2007 2006: 117m.
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 21.05263 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30 day period exceeds 950p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference shares or a resolution for the winding-up of the Company.
On a winding-up of the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of 1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are regarded as a compound instrument, consisting of an equity and a liability component.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity, net of deferred tax.
The liability component recognised on the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2007 2006 m m Redemption value of shares in issue at 1 January 120 129 Equity component 16 18 Deferred tax and interest element 14 13 Liability component at 1 January at amortised cost 90 98 Buy-back of preference shares 3 8 Liability component at 31 December at amortised cost 87 90 The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2007 amounted to 142m 2006: 157m.
The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at interest rates reflecting the yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.
