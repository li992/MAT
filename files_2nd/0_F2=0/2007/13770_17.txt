6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 30 September 2007, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 154.1 1,299.9 11.85 152.5 1,290.8 11.81 Effect of dilutive securities Options 7.1 0.06 8.9 0.08 Diluted EPS 154.1 1,307.0 11.79 152.5 1,299.7 11.73 84 Notes to the accounts | Group 6 Earnings per share continued Adjusted EPS Non GAAP measure 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 154.1 1,299.9 11.85 152.5 1,290.8 11.81 Non EBITA items: Intangible asset amortisation and net development expenditure 28.0 13.5 Taxation 8.7 4.1 Net EBITA adjustments 19.3 1.49 9.4 0.73 EBITA adjusted basic EPS 173.4 1,299.9 13.34 161.9 1,290.8 12.54 Effect of dilutive securities Options 7.1 0.06 8.9 0.08 EBITA adjusted diluted EPS 173.4 1,307.0 13.28 161.9 1,299.7 12.46 7 Goodwill 2007 2006 Note m m Cost At 1 October 1,561.9 1,076.8 Additions 26 j 90.3 529.2 Disposals 26 g 0.9 7.4 Exchange adjustments 79.2 36.7 At 30 September 1,572.1 1,561.9 Aggregate impairment at 1 October and 30 September Net book amount at 30 September 1,572.1 1,561.9 Details of acquisitions and disposals in the year are shown in note 26.
During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cashgenerating unit.
Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
85 The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by geographic area: 2007 2006 m m UK 181.1 152.6 France 203.2 161.2 Germany 22.0 20.4 Switzerland 26.9 22.5 Poland 6.4 6.2 Spain 94.5 91.6 North America 969.4 1,045.5 South Africa 31.3 25.1 Australia 22.7 25.0 Asia 14.6 11.8 1,572.1 1,561.9 The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In all cases, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The approved cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks specific to the CGU.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGU's operations is primarily based on past performance.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs was in the range of 18% 2006: 18% to 45% 2006: 54%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken and were in the range of 1.0% 2006: 1.0% to 5.0% 2006: 5.0%.
Goodwill impairment tests were conducted separately for each CGU.
Intangible assets apart from internally generated IPR&D and computer software relate to identifiable assets purchased as part of the Groups business combinations.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straightline basis over their expected useful economic life.
Lease rentals amounting to 3.4m 2006: 3.0m and 17.6m 2006: 18.6m relating to the lease of plant and machinery and property respectively are included in the income statement note 3.

Bank loans are denominated in a number of currencies and bear interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred.
Included in loans above is 561.5m 2006: 661.2m of unsecured loans after unamortised issue costs taken out in connection with acquisitions.
This is drawn down under 850.0m multi-currency revolving credit facilities, 650.0m expiring on 4 August 2011 and 200.0m expiring on 13 January 2011.
In the table above, loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of 1.0m 2006: 1.7m.
The Group has incurred total issue costs of 7.3m 2006: 7.1m in respect of these facilities.
These costs are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Unsecured borrowings were drawn in the following currencies: US Dollar 314.2m 2006: 549.2m, Euro 235.9m 2006: 106.5m and Swiss Franc 11.4m 2006: 5.5m and bear interest at a rate of 0.45% 2006: 0.45% above LIBOR.
16 Financial instruments Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below.
Additional disclosures are set out in the accounting policies relating to risk management and also in note 25.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has US Dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland.
The fair value of the US Dollar borrowings at 30 September 2007 was 314.2m 2006: 549.2m, the Euro borrowings 235.9m 2006: 106.3m and Swiss Franc borrowings 11.4m 2006: 5.5m.
The foreign exchange gain of 33.8m 2006: gain of 12.8m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate to book value.
Fair values of financial instruments For the following financial assets and liabilities: long-term borrowings, short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, shortterm deposits and cash at bank and in hand, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the instrument bearing interest at market rates and or the short-term nature of the instrument.

Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 30 September 2007 and 30 September 2006, these exposures are immaterial to the Group.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the Groups non-current liabilities at 30 September was as follows: 2007 2006 Finance Finance Debt leases Total Debt leases Total m m m m m m In more than one year but not more than two years 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 In more than two years but not more than five years 561.9 561.9 662.6 662.6 In more than five years 561.9 0.1 562.0 662.6 0.2 662.8 Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 30 September in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2007 2006 Total Total m m Expiring within one year Expiring between one and two years Expiring in more than two years 287.7 187.3 287.7 187.3 The facilities have been arranged to help finance the proposed expansion of the Groups activities.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

After deferred tax, the total charge was 6.1m 2006: 6.2m.
A reconciliation of share movements for options granted after 7 November 2002 to which IFRS 2 is applicable is shown below.
94 Notes to the accounts | Group 19 Share-based payments continued ESOS Under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, grants are made at an exercise price which approximates to the share price at the date of the grant and are made to senior executives and managers across the Group, as well as to other staff with high potential or to recognise significant achievement or local market practice.
The annual grant is normally made after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Under the rules of the ESOS, as amended at the Annual General Meeting in 2005, the annual grant of options to an individual is limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares under option worth 100% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance targets governing the vesting of options are based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed three year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

The Sage Group PSP The Performance Share Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2005.
Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to executive directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
This Plan is operated in conjunction with the ESOS.
Annual awards under the Plan are limited to shares worth up to 150% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares worth 100% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares are subject to performance conditions measuring the Groups total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of international software and computer services companies.
TSR has been chosen as the performance condition because it helps to align the interests of award holders with shareholders and complements the focus on Group financial results that arises from using EPS under the ESOS and annual bonus plan.
The comparator group for awards made in 2007 comprised the following companies: Blackbaud Exact Lawson Softwa re Northgate Information Solutions Business Objects Intuit Microsoft Oracle Cap Gemini iSOFT Misys Salesforce.
com Cegid LogicaCMG MYOB SAP 30% of shares vest for median TSR performance as compared to the comparator group whilst all shares vest for upper quintile top 20% TSR performance.
Between those two points, shares will vest on a straight-line basis.
TSR will be measured over a single three year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made to establish whether the criteria have been met and if these criteria are not met on the third anniversary of grant, the performance shares will lapse.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: March May January January June Grant date 2005 2005 2006 2007 2007 Share price at grant date 2.07 2.07 2.59 2.72 2.49 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Number of employees 20 5 89 102 2 Shares under award 1,808,170 210,588 2,348,990 2,793,003 33,000 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 44% 42% 32% 24% 22% Award life years 3 3 3 3 3 Expected life years 3 3 3 3 3 Risk free rate 4.7% 4.3% 4.2% 5.1% 5.7% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Expectation of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Fair value per award 1.385 1.341 1.401 1.478 1.041 96 Notes to the accounts | Group 19 Share-based payments continued The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.

The acquisition of the Shares was funded by the proceeds of a savings account with a bank or building society.
The original scheme adopted in 1996 continued in accordance with its terms for ten years and expired in February 2006.
A new scheme was approved by the members at the Annual General Meeting held on 2 March 2006.
Eligibility All UK employees, including executive directors, of the Company and its participating subsidiaries who have completed at least one years continuous service and are assessable to employment income tax are eligible to participate in the SAYE Plan.
The directors may offer participation to other employees and may alter the length of service required to qualify to a different period, not exceeding five years.
Employee contributions An employee who wishes to participate in the SAYE Plan will enter into a contract the SAYE contract with a savings body, designated by the directors for the purpose of the SAYE Plan, to make monthly contributions by deduction from their pay of not more than the maximum contribution permitted from time to time by HMRC currently 250.
A tax-free bonus currently equivalent to 1.4x or 4.4x the monthly contribution will be paid on completion of 36 or 60 monthly savings contributions respectively and another tax-free bonus currently 8.4x the monthly contribution including the payment at the end of 60 months will be paid after a further two years if the savings plus the initial bonus are not withdrawn prior to that date.
Exercise price An employee who applies for the grant of an option to acquire Shares will do so at a price the Exercise Price which is determined by the directors but which is not less than the greater of: 80% of the middle market quotation of a Share on the dealing day prior to the date of invitation as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List or, if the directors so decide, 80% of the average of the middle market quotations over the three dealing days prior to the date of the invitation or 80% of the middle market quotations at such other time or times agreed in advance with HMRC, and: In the case of an option over unissued Shares, the nominal value of a Share.
97 Grant of options Each option is granted over a number of Shares which, when multiplied by the Exercise Price, does not exceed the total monthly contributions plus the bonus payable on the maturity of the SAYE contract.
There will be no payment for the grant of an option.
Invitations to apply for options must be made within a period of 42 days after: Approval of the SAYE Plan by HMRC: or The publication by the Company of its interim or final results each year: or The day after the Companys Annual General Meeting: or Any day on which any change to the savings-related share option schemes legislation is announced or made: or If the directors resolve that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the operation of the SAYE Plan.
