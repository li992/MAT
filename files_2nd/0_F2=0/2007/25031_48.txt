IG Group Holdings plc 80 Report and Financial Statements 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2007 30.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Whereas the net financial assets and liabilities are denominated in the currencies shown above this does not represent the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk.
This is because the Groups exposures to market risk are managed on a portfolio basis and the denominated currency does not necessarily match the exposure currency.
The Group hedges its exposure to foreign currency risk within prescribed exposure limits as explained in the directors report on pages 41 to 42.
The Groups net exposure at each balance sheet date was as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 US Dollars 8,155 3,121 Euro 707 205 Australian dollars 376 671 Other 3,367 1,010 3,705 3,665 The Companys exposure to currency risk is not significant.
Market risk and significant terms and conditions relating to financial instruments The Group hedges the vast majority of its exposures to financial instruments and consequently, the directors consider these instruments do not represent a potentially significant exposure to market risk.
In reaching this conclusion, the directors have considered: net notional positions: the underlying asset mix and the relative risks of asset classes including equity, interest rate and foreign exchange: and sensitivity analysis relating to market movement assumptions.
Positions can be closed at any time by clients and can also be closed by the Group, in accordance with the Groups margining rules.
If after closing a position a client is in deficit, then the amount owing is repayable on demand to the Group.
When client positions are closed, corresponding positions relating to the hedged position are closed with brokers.
Accordingly the Group releases cash margin, which is repaid by brokers to the Group on demand.
