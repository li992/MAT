26. pensions and similar obligations The Group contributes to defined contribution plans as well as defined benefit plans.
The majority of the pension plans are funded through payments of annual premiums to independent insurance companies responsible for the pension obligation towards the employees defined contribution plans.
In these plans the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions irrespective of the funding by these insurance companies.
Pension costs related to such plans are recorded as expenses when incurred.
In some countries, most significantly, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, the Group has pension schemes where the actuarially determined pension obligations are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet defined benefit plans.
The defined benefit plans are primarily based on years of service and benefits are generally determined on the basis of salary and rank.
The majority of the obligations are funded, but in some countries, mainly Sweden and France, the obligation is unfunded.
The Groups liabilities under defined benefit plans may be significantly affected by changes in the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the social security rate, the rate of increase in salaries and pension contributions, changes in demographic variables or other events and circumstances.
There can be no assurance that the Group will not incur additional liabilities relating to its pension plans, and these additional liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Groups business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes to local legislation and regulations relating to defined benefit plan funding requirements may result in significant deviations in the timing and size of the expected cash contributions under such plans.
In certain countries, the Group participates in multi-employer pension schemes.
The funds are currently not able to provide the necessary information in order for the Group to account for the schemes as defined benefit plans.
There is a risk that the plans are not sufficiently funded.
Furthermore, there is a risk that changes to local legislation will entail that pension plans are reclassified from defined contribution plans to defined benefit plans, requiring the Group to recognise a provision.
In Sweden and Norway curtailment gains totalling DKK 45 million have been recognised in the income statement under staff costs, as a consequence of a reduction in the future benefits of the participants in the defined benefit plan.
