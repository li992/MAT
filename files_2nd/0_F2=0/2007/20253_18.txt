Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 63 Notes to the Accounts continued 13 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the net profit to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the financial statements to clearly consider trends without the impact of exceptional and non-cash items.
The underlying earnings per share figures for 2006 have been restated to reflect the inclusion of software amortisation within the amount shown for amortisation of intangible assets.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the most appropriate CGU.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to each segment is as follows: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Investment management 606,040 539,918 25,652 5,088 Property asset management 13,647 13,647 619,687 553,565 25,652 5,088 The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use cash flow projections based on the Group and Companys latest approved budgets which cover the 2007 08 financial year.
The long term cash flow projections extrapolate the 2007 08 budget figures over ten years with assumptions made on revenue, market growth and increases in overheads to cover inflation and increased levels of business.
Revenue is assumed to increase at a rate based on the Groups recent experience of new business inflows.
Equity assets under management 'AuM' are assumed to increase by 6% 2006: 6% per annum and fixed income AuM by 3% 2006: 3% per annum to reflect general market performance and or reinvestment of income by clients.
Increases in operating costs have been factored in at existing rates to cover assumed new business volumes and an allowance of 3% 2006: 3% per annum has been made for general inflation of costs.
To arrive at a net present value the cash flows are discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital which has been calculated at 10.5% 2006: 10.5% for investment management and 12.3% 2006: 12.3% for property asset management at 30 September 2007.
The value-in-use is estimated by calculating a terminal value and adding this to the net present value of the cash flows.
This overall value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in order to assess whether any impairment exists.
The Board considers the terminal value fairly reflects the long term nature of the business and there is no reason to believe that the business will not continue in the long term.
The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The review also covers management contracts in respect of open end funds which are considered to have indefinite lives and are therefore not subject to amortisation.
These assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets revealed a surplus of value-in-use over book value for both CGUs and therefore no impairment charge is required.

The fair value of the unlisted available for sale investments has been estimated using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices or rates.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique which are recorded in the balance sheet, and the related fair value gains recorded in the income statement, are reasonable and most appropriate at the balance sheet date.
The Group's accounting policy in respect of private equity investments is detailed on page 45.
Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and fair values of all the Group and Companys financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
Securities The fair value of listed investments is based on market bid prices at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of unlisted investments have been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines for Limited Partnership agreements where possible.
Interest bearing loans The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar issues available in the market and the liquidity of the assets and liabilities.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is at a variable rate of 1.1% above LIBOR and on the overdraft at the variable rate of 1% over base rate.
Further details of the liabilities are given in note 28.
They principally comprise available for sale investments and assets and other debtors.
The floating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and deposit balances which earn interest at rates which fluctuate according to money market rates.
Foreign net investment The majority of the Groups subsidiaries use sterling as their functional and presentation currencies.
The foreign currency net monetary assets of subsidiaries which adopt a different reporting currency are as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 US dollar 44,547 14,267 Singapore dollar 61,255 14,458 Australian dollar 11,692 1,400 Nordic currencies 17,044 12,970 Other 7,967 3,111 Risk management The key risks identified by the Group and the management of these risks are detailed in the Business Review on pages 17 and 18.
Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Groups life assurance subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which avail clients of a number of benefits from these pooled arrangements.
From the Groups perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to theses assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity this Group subsidiary company has some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The unit linked assets are matched by the associated insurance contract liabilities disclosed in note 20.
The assets above are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.

88 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 36 Contingent liabilities An action against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC brought jointly by the Association of Investment Companies AIC and a UK investment trust in early 2004 sought to establish that charges for investment management services provided to UK investment trusts should be exempt from VAT, rather than being subject to the standard rate as required by UK VAT legislation.
Following a decision of the European Court of Justice on certain questions referred by the UK VAT Tribunal, HMRC announced on 26 October 2007 that it would no longer seek to defend this case.
The Groups UK subsidiaries have received protective claims from most of the Groups investment trust clients for repayment of VAT that has previously been charged on management fees and the Group has submitted corresponding protective claims to HMRC.
Although HMRC has stated that it will now proceed to deal with the claims submitted, no definitive guidance or statement of practice has been issued in respect of how it will proceed.
The eventual outcome will also be affected by an appeal to be heard shortly by the House of Lords in a related case.
Whilst it is possible that the Group may incur some retrospective cost as a result of this case, the Directors do not expect a material liability to arise.
