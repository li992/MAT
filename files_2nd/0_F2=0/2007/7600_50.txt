CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups capital consists of equity and net debt.
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Groups activities, having due regard to interest rate and currency risks and the availability of borrowing facilities.
The gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is monitored regularly against both internal targets and external covenant requirements.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, rights issues of share capital.
Net debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.
At the year end, the capital comprised: 2007 2006 m m Total equity 311.9 211.5 Net debt 139.2 69.3 Gross capital employed 451.1 280.8 Gearing 45% 33% The increase in gearing during the year is regarded as acceptable and in line with the Groups overall development strategy.
There have been no significant changes in the Groups funding policy during the year.
