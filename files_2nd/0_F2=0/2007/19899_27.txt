Investment and development property Following the formation of the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund it is likely that the fund will acquire the Groups future developments.
Hence properties acquired with the intention of selling them to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund following completion are now treated as property under development in current assets, carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, rather than fixed assets, carried at fair value.
The impact if these properties were carried at fair value rather than cost is as follows: 2007 Investment property Property Investment under under property development development Total 000 000 000 000 Balance at end of year 597,747 102,180 121,936 821,863 Valuation gain not recognised on property held at cost - - 38,726 38,726 Fair value at end of year 597,747 102,180 160,662 860,589 2006 Investment property Property Investment under under property development development Total 000 000 000 000 Balance at end of year 656,969 124,980 12,093 794,042 Valuation gain not recognised on property held at cost - - 2,214 2,214 Fair value at end of year 656,969 124,980 14,307 796,256 Included within investment properties and investment properties under development are the following values in respect of leasehold interests: 2007 Investment property Property Investment under under property development development Total 000 000 000 000 Valuation and net book value Long leasehold 105,230 32,320 - 137,550 Short leasehold 11,920 - - 11,920 117,150 32,320 - 149,470 2006 Investment property Property Investment under under property development development Total 000 000 000 000 Valuation and net book value Long leasehold 71,940 22,032 - 93,972 Short leasehold 13,078 - - 13,078 85,018 22,032 - 107,050 The total interest included in investment and development properties at 31 December 2007 was 29.197m 2006: 23.259m.
