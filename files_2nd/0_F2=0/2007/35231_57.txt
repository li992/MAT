Equity-settled option scheme The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of options granted during the year under the equity-settled option scheme operated by the group.
No options were granted during 2007.
2007 2006 Option pricing model used Binomial lattice Share price at date of grant 15.120 Exercise price 15.120 Number granted 14,250 Contractual life 10 years Risk free interest rate 4.8% Volatility 20% Dividend yield 0.9% For the 2006 grant, additional assumptions have been made that there is no employee turnover before vesting and 4% after vesting, and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 20% in the money.
The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on a statistical analysis of daily prices over the last five years.
Cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities see note 22.
A binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31st December 2007 of 14.14 and a dividend yield of 3% were used together with risk free interest rates of between 4.4% and 4.8% depending on the term of the options.
Due to the small number of individuals who have been granted these options, an assumption of zero employee turnover has been made.
27% p. a. and 25% p. a. respectively have been used for options with lives of one year, three years and five years and over.
In general, the value of an option is affected by how quickly employees are assumed to exercise their awards after vesting.
In this case, however, given the other assumptions, the share price at the 31st December 2007, and the fact that the expected lives of the options are relatively short, the fair values are not sensitive to this assumption.
It has been assumed that employees try to maximise their returns and therefore do not exercise their options immediately, but tend to exercise their options later at the financially optimal date.
