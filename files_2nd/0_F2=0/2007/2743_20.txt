The Groups policy on foreign currencies is detailed in Note 1 p. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 77 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting Policies continued d Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the value of the underlying cash-generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s230 1 b of the Companies Act 1985 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income Statement of the parent company.
The profit attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2007 was $1,170,772,000 2006: $164,870,000.
e Joint Ventures Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and producing activities.
Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings.
Cairns principal licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairns interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on page 71. f Revenue and other income Revenue from operating activities Revenue represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis, and tariff income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements and is included within Other operating income in the Income Statement.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method on an accruals basis and is recognised within Finance income in the Income Statement.
g Oil and gas intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence by licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining exploration targets is capitalised initially within exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well by well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well by well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within development producing assets after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development producing assets on a field by field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
78 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs.
Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement.
Net proceeds from any disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Depletion Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within development producing assets, such as fields, processing facilities and pipelines, which are significant in relation to the total cost of a development producing asset.
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment development producing assets on a unit of production basis, based on proven and probable reserves on a field by field basis.
In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment Exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances the exploration asset is allocated to development producing assets within the same geographic segment and tested for impairment.
Any such impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Where there are no development producing assets within a geographic segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
Impairment reviews on development producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identified in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Cairns cash-generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash-generating unit is compared with the associated expected discounted future net cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the Income Statement as impairment.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated oil price of $60 bbl 2006: $30 bbl or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% 2006: 3% and 10% respectively.
Forecasted production profiles are determined on an asset by asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period, that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
h Property, plant & equipment other Property, plant & equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Depreciation Annual rate % method Tenants improvements 1033 straight-line Vehicles and equipment 2550 straight-line Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the economic life or the remaining term of the lease.
i Intangible assets other Intangible assets have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and amortised over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Amortisation Annual rate % method Software costs 2550 straight-line Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 79 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting Policies continued j Investments The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
The recoverable value of investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
k Inventory Inventories of oil and condensate held at the Balance Sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling price in accordance with established industry practice.
l Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group holds financial assets which are classified as either available-for-sale financial assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or with another financial asset.
Financial liabilities are categorised as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost.
All of the Groups financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the financial instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
The derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the Income Statement.
The Group did not apply hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments held during the current or prior year.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables.
The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available for sale financial assets will be recycled through the Income Statement.
Loans and other receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment.
Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of loans and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective material evidence of impairment, for example, overdue trade debt.
Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement or the Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.
Bank deposits Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the face of the Balance Sheet.
80 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other non-derivative financial liabilities Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest-bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings All interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Groups revolving credit facilities, classified according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility.
Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects which are capitalised within the development producing asset.
m Equity Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital and share premium.
n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit loss for the year.
Taxable profit loss differs from net profit loss as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit loss.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 81 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting Policies continued n Taxation continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
o Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant & equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proven and probable reserves, is included in the Depletion and decommissioning charge in the Income Statement and the unwinding of the discount on the provision is included within Finance costs.
p Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, Cairn translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentational currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non-$ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December Average 2007 2007 2006 2006 Sterling 0.504 0.500 0.511 0.543 Indian Rupee 39.400 41.339 44.260 45.277 q Employee benefits Pension schemes Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the Uk and India.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
Cairn also operates insured benefit schemes for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under local legislation.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits these are treated as defined contribution schemes.
The pension cost charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over the three-year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using either the BlackScholes model or the binomial model, further details of which are given in Note 7.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
82 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Shares acquired to meet awards under these share schemes are held by the ESOP Trust.
The accounts of the ESOP Trust are aggregated into these financial statements.
The costs of awards to employees in the form of cash but based on share performance phantom options are recognised over the period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
Termination benefits Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return for employee redundancy.
r Operating lease commitments Cairn charges rentals payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessor and has therefore accounted for the contracts as operating leases.
s Exceptional items Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business.
Such items are identified as exceptional and a full explanation is given in the notes to the accounts.
t key estimations and assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results which will only be known in time.
Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation are noted below, with further details of the assumptions used listed at the relevant note.

Accounting Policies continued u Prior year adjustments Financial assets Investments, representing the Groups holding in Videocon Industries Limited, a company listed in India, have been correctly reclassified as available-for-sale financial assets.
This investment was previously recorded as an investment measured at cost but as a reliable measure of fair value was readily available this asset should have been reclassified under IAS 39 in prior years.
The restated financial asset is now shown in Note 17.
Indian deferred tax liabilities Deferred tax liabilities relating to India have been restated to reflect the taxable temporary difference that remains at the end of the seven-year tax holiday period on the Rajasthan tangible development producing asset in two of the Groups subsidiaries.
Cairn Energy India Pty Limited had recorded deferred tax liabilities to reflect the difference between the net book value of development producing assets and tax written down values.
However, a liability should only have been created to recognise the taxable temporary difference on balances remaining at the end of the tax holiday period since movements in net book values and tax written down values during the tax holiday period will have no tax impact.
Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited previously had no deferred tax liability recognised due to the availability of Indian tax losses.
As these losses will unwind during the tax holiday period, a taxable temporary difference will remain at the end of the tax holiday period reflecting the forecast excess of net book values over tax written down values.
A deferred tax liability should therefore have been recognised.
UK deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets representing Uk tax losses available on Indian assets in Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited have been reversed on the basis that they have no economic benefit to the group given the excess of Indian tax rates over Uk rates and the availability of double taxation relief.
As there would have been no economic benefit associated with the losses in previous years, a prior year adjustment has been made.
The amount of the prior year adjustments and the financial statement line items affected are shown below.

Acquisitions and Disposals During the year the Group acquired Plectrum Petroleum Plc Plectrum and medOil plc medOil.
As required under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, fair values have been assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities of those companies including intangible exploration assets.
Given the inherently uncertain nature of oil and gas exploration, these fair value calculations are highly judgemental in nature.
The fair value calculations are based on the information available at the date of acquisition and are provisional in nature.
These will be reassessed within 12 months from the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. a Acquisition of Plectrum Petroleum Plc On 7 September 2007, the Group announced a recommended cash offer for Plectrum.
Plectrum holds a 50% equity interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia and in addition has interests in Australia, Peru and the Uk.
The offer was declared unconditional in all respects and Cairn gained control of Plectrum on 10 October 2007.
By 31 December 2007, the Group had acquired 98% of the voting shares of Plectrum.
The remaining 2% shareholding was undergoing compulsory acquisition as at 31 December 2007.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Plectrum as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately prior to acquisition were: Fair value Previous recognised carrying on acquisition value $000 $000 Intangible exploration appraisal assets 72,598 4,894 Property, plant & equipment other 8 14 Intangible assets other 11,961 Trade and other receivables 4,034 1,326 Cash and cash equivalents 6,107 6,107 Trade and other payables 3,192 3,192 Deferred tax liabilities 34,165 Provisions 10,861 Net assets 34,529 21,110 Goodwill arising on acquisition Note 16 13,511 Total consideration 48,040 The total cost of the combination was $48.0m which is made up of: $000 Cash purchase of Plectrum shares at 13p per share 46,545 Costs associated with the acquisition 1,495 48,040 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 85 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 3.
Acquisitions and Disposals continued Cash outflow on acquisition: $000 Net cash acquired 6,107 Cash paid on acquisition 48,040 Net cash outflow 41,933 The goodwill of $13.5m is created on recognition of the deferred tax liability in Plectrum on acquisition.
The goodwill is tested for impairment annually and no impairment arises in the year ended 31 December 2007.
Impact of Plectrum Acquisition on Group results in 2007 From the date of acquisition, Plectrum incurred a loss of $1.7m.
This loss is included in the results of the Group.
As Plectrum does not hold producing assets, the acquisition had no impact on Group revenue.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been $1,523.8m.
b Acquisition of medOil plc On 7 September 2007, the Group announced a recommended cash offer for medOil.
medOil holds a 100% equity interest in the Louza permit offshore Tunisia and in addition has interests in Albania, Spain and Sicily.
The offer was declared unconditional in all respects and Cairn gained control of medOil on 10 October 2007.
By 31 December 2007, the Group had acquired 97% of the voting shares of medOil.
The remaining 3% shareholding was undergoing compulsory acquisition as at 31 December 2007.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of medOil as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately prior to acquisition were: Fair value Previous recognised carrying on acquisition value $000 $000 Intangible exploration appraisal assets 66,907 3,950 Property, plant & equipment other 22 22 Trade and other receivables 1,619 41 Cash and cash equivalents 1,228 1,228 Trade and other payables 1,788 1,788 Deferred tax liabilities 17,628 Provisions 2,154 Net assets 48,206 3,453 Negative goodwill arising on acquisition 17,373 Total consideration 30,833 The total cost of the combination was $30.8m which is made up of: $000 Cash purchase of medOil shares at 23p per share 29,610 Costs associated with the acquisition 1,223 30,833 86 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Cash outflow on acquisition: $000 Net cash acquired 1,228 Cash received for share warrants exercised 1,578 Cash paid on acquisition 30,833 Net cash outflow 28,027 The negative goodwill of $17.4m arises on acquisition as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the consideration paid.
In accordance with IFRS the negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Impact of medOil Acquisition on Group results in 2007 From the date of acquisition, medOil incurred a loss of $0.3m.

The review determined that the value of certain units previously impaired within the Capricorn Group was in excess of the carrying value.
As a result a reversal of the prior year impairment charge of $3.7m was recognised through the Income Statement.
At the year end the Group also carried out impairment reviews of intangible exploration appraisal assets where indicators of impairment were found to exist.
As the cash-generating unit of the Capricorn Group is currently carried at net present value there is no additional headroom to support the carrying value of exploration assets where such indicators exist.
As a result a write-down of $58.9m in relation to intangible exploration appraisal assets was charged to the Income Statement.
Refer to details on the reason for impairment in the Operating and Exploration Review on page 14 and Note 1 g for details of the assumptions used in the impairment calculation.
The write-down of oil and gas assets in 2006 followed an impairment review of the cash-generating unit within property, plant & equipment development producing assets in the Capricorn Group segment.
The review determined that the estimated net present value of future cash flows was less than the carrying value of the asset in the cash-generating unit.
As a result a write-down of $71.5m was charged to the Income Statement.

Staff Costs continued The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model.
The main inputs to the model include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options.
The risk free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 68 over a ten-year period to the date of award.

No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because Cairn is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at the Balance Sheet date, a deferred tax asset was not recognised in respect of Group losses of $799.0m 2006 restated : $532.1m Company: $131.7m: 2006: $64.8m where it is not probable that they can be utilised in future periods.
At 31 December 2007, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of trading losses.
At 31 December 2006, a deferred tax asset of $5.3m restated was recognised as it was considered that these losses would be utilised against future trading profits arising to the Group.

The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 7% p. a.
The change in decommissioning estimate in 2007 arose as a result of an increase in the estimated costs of decommissioning for the Ravva, Lakshmi and Gauri fields and additional wells drilled in Rajasthan.
The change in decommissioning estimate in 2006 arose primarily as a result of the recognition of a decommissioning provision for the Rajasthan fields.
Other provisions are production related payments payable to the GoI specified within the respective PSCs and provisions for committed spend recognised on the acquisition of Plectrum and medOil see Note 3.
A contingent liability has been disclosed within these financial statements in respect of additional payments that may fall due with regard to the Ravva arbitration proceedings: see Note 35 for details.

These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Company Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arise on translation of the Companys functional results into $ presentational currency in accordance with IAS 21.

Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies Cairn Energy PLC Group and Company The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, shortand medium-term deposits, money market liquidity funds, loans and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives such as equity finance and project finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas projects.
The Group and local treasury functions are responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash flow monitoring.
They must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
The Company and the Group may from time to time opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise their exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year, Cairn India entered into forward foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development.
Refer to Note 31 for further details.
During 2007, a currency exchange option contract matured.
The contract was entered into by the Company in 2006 in order to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations resulting from transactions carried out in Indian Rupees as part of the IPO.
This was not exercised due to favourable movements in the exchange rate.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 119 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 30.
Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued The main risks arising from the Companys and the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Liquidity risk Cairn India has available an $850m revolving credit facility to fund Rajasthan developments.
The facility was previously held by Cairn Energy PLC and certain of its subsidiaries but an amendment agreement was entered into on 22 November 2006 to transfer the facility to Cairn India.
Following the IPO of Cairn India on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India, the amendment agreement became fully effective on 31 January 2007.
The facility is provided by a consortium of ten international banks expiry date 31 December 2011 and the International Finance Corporation expiry date 31 December 2015.
Interest is charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The maximum facility amount that can be drawn at any point in time is determined by reference to the net present value of the Rajasthan developments.
The full $850m facility is currently available to be drawn.
Cairn India may cancel and repay the facility at any time.
Under the terms of the original agreement, as security under the facility, a share pledge was provided over the shares in Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited a 100% subsidiary of Cairn India Holdings Limited which holds 50% of the Groups interest in Rajasthan.
On 28 March 2008, Cairn Energy PLC entered into a 30m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital.
The facility is jointly provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and the Bank of Scotland PLC and expires on 31 January 2013.
In addition, as at 31 December 2007, the Group has $80m 2006: $65m of facilities in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees.
Fixed rates of interest apply to these.
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds and shortand medium-term deposits, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium-term expenditure requirements.
Interest rate risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium-term deposit at floating rates.
It is Cairns policy to deposit funds with banks or other financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue.
Short medium-term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates.
The treasury function may from time to time opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs on this debt by using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there are no such instruments 2006: none.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a change in interest rates through the impact on floating rate borrowings and deposits.
In addition there would be an increase of $375,000 to development producing assets carrying value as a result of the capitalisation of the borrowing costs for the Rajasthan development 2006: $150,000.
Increase decrease Effect on profit in basis points before tax 2007 50 $3,325,000 2006 50 $232,000 The amounts calculated are based on actual drawings and deposits in the periods for 50 basis point movement in the total rate of interest on each loan or deposit.
Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency, and actively managing the residual net position.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The loan facilities allow loans denominated in US Dollars, Sterling, Euros or such other currency as may be agreed between the lenders and Cairn from time to time.
120 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Cairn reports in US Dollars which, with most assets US$ denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
During the year, Cairn India entered into foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development.
Commodity price risk There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, Lakshmi and Ravva Gas Sales Contracts GSCs.
The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva and CB-OS 2 oil sales are required to be made to approved government nominated buyers at floating prices.
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during either the current or the previous year.
There were no outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
Credit risk Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the Lakshmi and Sangu GSCs.
With respect to Ravva there is no payment security: however, the buyers have been nominated by the GoI.
With respect to deposit, money market and other treasury arrangements, as a general rule the Board will only approve a bank or financial institution that has a Moodys or Standard & Poors rating for long-term deposits of AA and above.
The Board will continue to assess the Groups strategies for managing credit risks but at this time they view existing policies as satisfactory for oil and gas sales in South Asia.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in Note 20.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Capital management The objective of the Groups capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out committed work programme requirements.
The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2007.

Contingent Liabilities Ravva Arbitration The calculation of the GoIs share of petroleum produced from the Ravva oil field has been a matter of disagreement for some years.
Ravva is an unincorporated Joint Venture in which Cairn India has an interest.
An arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as favourable as had been hoped.
The GoI, however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts and Cairn India continues to maintain its challenge to the GoIs appeal.
Cairn has challenged both the GoIs right to appeal, and the grounds of that appeal.
If the GoI were successful on both these points, it is unclear what process would then follow to resolve the original issue under dispute.
Cairn India will defend its right to continue to refer to the existing arbitration panel, whose composition and terms of reference were agreed by all parties at the outset.
A date for the appeal has been set in the second half of 2008.
In the event that the GoIs appeal succeeded and a process then ensued which concluded with the arbitration award being reversed in a manner and in a forum which Cairn accepted as binding, then Cairn India would be due to pay an additional $63.9m.
Cairn India would also be potentially liable for interest on this sum currently estimated at $24.2m, though the calculation of interest would require further agreement.
In a separate and unrelated dispute related to the profit petroleum calculations under the Ravva PSC, the Ravva JV received a claim from the DGH for approximately US$166.4m representing US$37.4m net to Cairn for an alleged underpayment of profit petroleum to the GOI, together with interest on that amount through to 30 June 2006 of US$30.6m representing US$6.9m net to Cairn.
This claim relates to the GOIs allegation that the Ravva JV has recovered costs in excess of the Base Development Costs BDC cap imposed in the PSC and that the Ravva JV has also allowed these excess costs in the calculation of the PTRR.
Cairn India and its JV partners believe that such a claim is unsustainable under the terms of the PSC because, amongst other reasons, the BDC cap only applies to the initial development of the Ravva field and not to subsequent development activities under the PSC.
Additionally the Ravva JV has contested the basis of the calculation in the above claim from the DGH.
Even if upheld, Cairn believes that the DGH has miscalculated the sums that would be due to the GOI in such circumstances.
Indian Service Tax Cairn India has received two show cause notices from the GoI for non-payment of service tax as a recipient of services from Foreign Service providers.
These notices cover periods from 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2006 and 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 and total $15.5m.
A writ petition challenging the applicability of the service tax has been filed with the High Court in India.
Should the adjudication go against Cairn India, the company would be liable for the $15.5m, though it would be able to recover amounts relating to services provided to Joint Ventures from Joint Venture partners.
