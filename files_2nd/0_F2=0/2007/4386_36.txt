These costs are expected to be incurred at various intervals over the next 30 years.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current prices, escalated at 2.5%, and discounted at 7%.
The economic life and the timing of the decommissioning liabilities are dependent on Government legislation, commodity price and the future production profiles of the respective production and development facilities.
In addition, the costs of decommissioning are subject to inflationary deflationary pressures in the cost of third party service provision.
The decommissioning provision has increased substantially during the year.
This is mainly due to the decommissioning provision recognised for the Jotun asset of 25,001,000 as a result of the acquisition of Ener Petroleum ASA details in note 29.
