Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2007 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 84 for the year ended 31 March 2007 22.
DEFERRED TAXATION continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: Consolidated Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities 923.7 919.1 27.9 24.9 Deferred tax assets 66.0 86.0 Net deferred tax liabilities 857.7 833.1 27.9 24.9 The deferred tax asset relates to the defined benefit pension scheme liability in a subsidiary company.
The parent company defined benefit scheme has a deferred tax liability in 2007 and 2006.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 40.6m 2006 40.6m available for offset against future profits.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2.1m 2006 2.3m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is 17.5m 2006 11.1m.
