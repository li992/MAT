FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued The US dollar denominated financial instruments consist mainly of trade receivables and inter-group loans.
The Canadian dollar denominated financial instruments consist of borrowings in that currency.
ii Translational risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from Hunting PLCs investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted Canadian and US dollar earnings into sterling.
These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
The foreign exchange exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional currency as that of the hedged net assets.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from US dollar and Canadian dollar denominated net assets.
These borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
b Interest rate risk Borrowings at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow risk and borrowings at fixed interest rates expose it to fair value risk.
The Groups policy is to minimise interest costs and changes in the market value of debt.
A significant proportion of the budgeted annual interest cost is fixed to ensure some predictability of the interest charge.
In order to achieve this, derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, swaptions and option based products caps, collars and floors are used.
c Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to changes in the price of oil, gas and electricity commodities and these are monitored regularly.
Oil and gas price futures and swaps are used to hedge the exposure to oil and gas price movements.
These derivatives are not designated in a hedge.
Electricity price swaps are used to hedge the exposure to electricity prices in Canada and are designated in a cash flow hedge.
The character of financial and price risks and the management of these risks has not significantly changed during the financial year or since the year end.
d Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, deposits, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Financing transactions are with leading financial institutions, which have Fitch ratings between F1 and F1, and no losses are expected from non-performance of these counterparties.
Funds are only invested with approved financial institutions.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
The exposure limits are determined by the relationship with the counterparty and other information such as official credit ratings, financial reports and press reports.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate hedging contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued e Liquidity risk Sufficient funds and committed facilities are available to satisfy both the Groups long and short-term requirements.
Committed facilities represent 120% to 160% of the Groups forecast peak funding requirements.
These facilities totalled 269.6m 2006 248.9m and comprise 207.7m 2006 162.5m of committed facilities and 61.9m 2006 50.7m of uncommitted facilities.
All of these facilities are unsecured and are provided by a variety of funding sources.
The committed facilities comprise Private Placement loan notes of US$70m 35.2m, a 125m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of five banks and four bilateral facilities totalling 47.5m.
Of the Private Placement, US$40m is repayable on 10 January 2012, and US$30m is repayable in five equal annual payments of US$6m starting on 10 January 2008.
The 125m multi-currency loan facility expires on 22 September 2010.
Drawings made under these facilities are charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.375%.
A commitment fee of 0.15% is payable on the undrawn amount.
The four bilateral facilities mature on 18 December 2008, 6 February 2009, 22 March 2009 and 14 December 2009.
Drawings under these facilities are at LIBOR plus margins between 0.375% and 0.65%.
Commitment fees payable on the undrawn portion range from 0.15% to 0.4%.
Surplus funds are placed in short-term deposits with approved banks or with AAA rated money market funds.
Set out below are maturity analyses of the Groups and Companys financial liabilities at the year end which will be settled on a net basis.
The maturity dates are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and the amounts are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows.
The carrying amounts in the balance sheet are the discounted amounts.
Balances due within one year have been included in the maturity analysis at their carrying amounts, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2007.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2007.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other postretirement obligations, provisions but including onerous leases and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
i Interest rate sensitivity Group At 31 December, if Canadian interest rates had been 0.5% higher or lower, with all other variables held constant, the posttax effects for the year would have been as follows: 82 annual report & accounts two thousand & seven Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.

ii Foreign exchange rate sensitivity At 31 December, if the Canadian dollar had strengthened or weakened by 15% against sterling, with all other variables held constant, the impact on post-tax profit and equity for the year would have been as follows: 2007 2006 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity m m m m Canadian dollar exchange rates 15% 2.7 0.8 6.9 2.0 Canadian dollar exchange rates -15% 3.6 1.1 8.7 2.8 The movement on the post-tax profit is a result of a change in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which have not been designated in a hedging relationship.
Although these derivatives are not designated as a hedge, they act as a commercial hedge.
annual report & accounts two thousand & seven 83 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued The movement on equity arises from changes in Canadian dollar borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents in a hedge of the net investments in Canadian operations.
The impact of translating the net assets of Canadian operations into sterling using a sensitised Canadian dollar to sterling exchange rate is excluded from the sensitivity analysis.
If the net assets of the Canadian operations had been included in this analysis, they would generate offsetting gains and losses in equity.
At 31 December, if the US dollar had strengthened or weakened by 15% against sterling, with all other variables held constant, the impact on post-tax profit and equity for the year would have been as follows: 2007 2006 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity m m m m US dollar exchange rates 15% 3.9 7.2 7.6 1.2 US dollar exchange rates -15% 5.7 9.7 7.8 1.6 The movement on the post-tax profit is a result of a change in the fair values of derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedge and trade receivables denominated in US dollars, where the functional currency of the entity is a currency other than US dollars.
Although the derivatives have not been designated in a hedge relationship, they act as a commercial hedge and will offset the underlying transaction when it occurs.
The movement on equity arises from changes in US dollar borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents in the hedge of net investments in US operations.
These movements will offset the translation of the US operations net assets into sterling.
However, the impact of translating the net assets of US operations into sterling using a sensitised US dollar to sterling exchange rate is excluded from the sensitivity analysis.
iii Commodity price sensitivity The table below summarises the impact on post-tax profit and equity for changes in commodity prices on the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are in place to economically hedge the Groups exposure to those commodity prices.
The analysis is based on the assumption that the crude oil price moves by US$8.64 2006 US$7.33 and electricity prices move by C$4.03 2006 C$28.47, with all other variables held constant.

These instruments have not been designated in a hedge relationship, but will offset future transactions.
The movements in equity are a result of changes in the fair value of the electricity price swap, which has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
