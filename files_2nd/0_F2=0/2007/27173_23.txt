40 Murray International Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Law and Accounting Standards UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in 2003 and revised in December 2005.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe this is appropriate for the reasons outlined in the Directors Report on page 25. b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an exdividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to their circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged to the Income Statement.
Expenses are charged against revenue except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged to the capital account in the Income Statement: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
The performance fee has been charged 100% to realised capital reserves, as the fee will have arisen wholly or predominately by virtue of the capital performance of the Investments.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Income Statement on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year, based on the marginal basis.
e Investments All investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
This is done Murray International Trust PLC 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued because all investments are considered to form part of a group of financial assets which is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Companys documented investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the middle rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as capital gain or loss to capital or revenue within the Income Statement depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.
h Derivative financial instruments Financial derivatives are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

In 2004, the Association of Investment Companies AIC and JPM Claverhouse Investment Trust plc launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC in which they claimed that management fees charged to UK investment trusts should be exempt from VAT.
On 28 June 2007, the European Court of Justice found in favour of the AIC Claverhouse case in respect of the specific questions referred to it by the UK VAT Tribunal.
HMRC accepted this judgement in November 2007.
Your Company is taking appropriate steps to reclaim the relevant VAT that has been paid on management fees since 2001.
The timing and quantum of this repayment, together with the status of pre-2001 VAT payments, are being discussed with the Manager and are still to be determined.
On the basis of this, no contingent asset has been disclosed.

The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude short-term debtors and creditors, other than for currency disclosures.
i Market price risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the values of the fixed interest rate securities.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise fixed rate, revolving, and uncommitted facilities.
The fixed rate Yen facilities are used to finance opportunities at low rates and, the revolving and uncommitted facilities to provide flexibility in the short-term.
Current guidelines state that the total borrowings will not exceed 30 per cent of the net assets of the Company.
Details of borrowings at the 31 December 2007 are shown in note 13 on page 47.

If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower based on current parameter used by Managers Investment Risk Department on risk assessment and all other variables were held constant, the Companys: profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 would increase decrease by 447,000 2006 increase decrease by 39,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
These figures have been calculated based on cash positions at each year end.
equity reserves would increase decrease by 725,000 2006 increase decrease by 267,000.
