The accounts on pages 66 to 72 were approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by: Bill Dye Russell Taylor Chief Executive Officer Finance Director 3 December 2007 ITE Group plc 66 Annual Report 2007 Notes 1 Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards and have been applied consistently.
Changes in accounting policies The Company operates the Groups share-based payment schemes, details of which can be found in note 25 to the consolidated accounts.
The Company has followed the guidance set out in UITF 44 Group and Treasury Share Transactions where the Company issues shares in relation to share options granted to Directors and employees for services rendered to the Companys subsidiaries.
The Company records an additional investment in its subsidiaries by way of a capital contribution when issuing shares in relation to these share options schemes.
Adopting UITF 44 has resulted in a prior year adjustment.
The total effect of this has been to increase opening shareholders funds by 1.2 million, but there has been no effect on reported profit.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value.
Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to profit or loss.
Hedging instruments Cash flow hedges are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in the hedging reserve and any ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Fair value hedges are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Any ineffective portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the period.
The Companys use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups financial policies.
ITE Group plc 67 Annual Report 2007 Notes continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not effect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ESOT.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity.
The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on managements best estimate.
2 Profit for the year The profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2007 was 13.7 million 2006: 9.1 million.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
