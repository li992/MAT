The bonds mature 5 years from the issue date and can be redeemed at that date for 107.21% 294.8m of their principal amount or can be converted, at the option of the holder, into shares at an initial conversion price of 11.782.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment following capital distributions whether by cash dividend, dividend in specie, scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise.
The share price at the date of pricing of the convertible bonds in the market was 8.60.
The fair values of the liability component and equity component were determined at issuance of the bonds.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity as a separate reserve note 27.
The value of convertible bonds recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: m Face value of convertible bonds issued on 14 December 2005 275.0 Deferred issue costs paid 9.3 Net proceeds 265.7 Equity component 30.0 Liability component at 14 December 2005 235.7 Finance cost note 5 15.0 Cash interest paid 9.3 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.1 Liability component at 19 August 2006 242.5 Finance cost note 5 22.7 Cash interest paid 13.7 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.6 Liability component at 18 August 2007 253.1 Finance cost on the bonds is calculated using the effective interest method by applying the effective interest rate of 9.23% August 2006: 9.23%.
21 Financial instruments All derivative financial instruments are held on the balance sheet at fair value: the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all material transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Group has no material exposure to equity securities or commodity price risk and it is the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Income and cash flows from cash and cash equivalents fluctuates with interest rates.
77 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 3 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 18 August 2007 21 Financial instruments continued The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes, bonds, and bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the overhedging, where this is financially practicable, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
The Group has taken out derivative financial instruments such that 99.7% of all loans at 18 August 2007 August 2006: 99.7% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements note 20 thereby largely eliminating the Groups exposure to changes in interest rates.
Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk such that the Group would not benefit from falls in interest rate and would be exposed to unplanned costs should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
Liquidity risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
The Group is primarily financed by secured loan notes, with approximately 93% August 2006: 93% of the capital balance on these loan notes being repayable after more than five years from the balance sheet date, subject to relevant covenants being met.
The Board continues to review alternative sources of finance.
The Groups objective is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain a strong credit rating so maturing short term debt may be refinanced as it falls due.
Cash balances are invested in short term deposits such that they are readily available to settle short term liabilities or to fund capital additions.
Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows all non-current : Group Company 18 August 2007 18 August 2007 Non-current Non-current Non-current Non-current assets liabilities assets liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 16.1 113.0 0.8 0.8 Forward interest rate swaps 16.1 113.0 0.8 0.8 Group Company 19 August 2006 19 August 2006 Non-current Non-current Non-current Non-current assets liabilities assets liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 5.8 152.1 5.8 Forward interest rate swaps 37.7 37.7 5.8 189.8 5.8 37.7 The interest rate swaps replace the LIBOR rate on the Groups secured floating rate loan notes and bank loans with a fixed rate.
The capital amount of the swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the associated notes over their life see note 20 for more detail.
Of the total carrying value of the interest rate swaps 49.5m August 2006: 53.7m qualify as, and are treated as, cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and movements in their fair values are recognised directly in equity.
The remaining 47.4m August 2006: 92.6m do not qualify for hedge accounting with movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups secured loan notes and convertible bonds, there are no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups secured loan notes at 18 August 2007 is 4,754.4m August 2006: 4,558.1m and the fair value, measured at market value or the market value of equivalent loans, of this debt at that date is 4,808.2m August 2006: 4,753.2m.
The carrying value of the convertible bonds is 253.1m at 18 August 2007 August 2006: 242.5m and the fair value, measured using present value of discounted cash flows, of these bonds is 255.5m August 2006: 245.3m.
