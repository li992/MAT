Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Company financial statements.
However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for, if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Pension costs Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

Share-based payments The fair value of awards under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans are charged against profit on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Groups estimate of awards that will eventually vest.
