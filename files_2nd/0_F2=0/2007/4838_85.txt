m Post retirement benefits DSG international plc maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
The last valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2004, using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
A further actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2007 is currently underway, however, results are not expected to be available until late in 2007.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, showed the value of assets to be sufficient to cover 87 per cent of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
At 28 April 2007, the valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of FRS 17 showed a gross pension deficit of 38.4 million 29 April 2006 141.7 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements, which although presented under IAS 19 Employment Benefits show figures and disclosures equivalent to those applicable under FRS 17.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the pension scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the defined contribution section is now offered to eligible employees.
n Related parties The Company has applied the exemption allowed by FRS 8 regarding disclosure of transactions with other undertakings which are members of the DSG international plc Group.
