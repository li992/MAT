90 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Provisions continued Claims reserves The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey, Luxembourg and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash services, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Onerous contracts The onerous contract provision mainly comprises the provision against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall and for long-term idle, leased properties.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing the properties.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.
Other provisions Other provisions include amounts arising in respect of disposals where their final calculation is dependent on future events.
The company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Provision is made for the estimated value of settlements likely to be made, but both this value and the timing of any payments are uncertain.
The directors do not anticipate, taking account of legal and other professional advice as appropriate, that the outcome of these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on the groups financial position or on the results of its operations.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax liabilities 75.0 81.7 Deferred tax assets 84.2 115.7 Total deferred tax position 9.2 34.0 At the balance sheet date, the group has unutilised tax losses of approximately 126.5m 2006: 118.4m potentially available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 5.1m 2006: 6.8m has been recognised in respect of approximately 19.3m 2006: 32.1m of gross losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 107.2m 2006: 86.3m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of 0.8m, 3.0m, 1.7m, 1.4m and 0.4m which will expire in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
