Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
23 Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, bank overdrafts, finance leases and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Interest rate and liquidity risks The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk and liquidity risk are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice this has meant that no deposits have been made with a maturity date greater than 3 months in the course of the year.
b Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenue, purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash ows can be affected signicantly by movements in exchange rates and in US Dollar and Euro rates in particular.
Where such transactions are material, the Board has a policy of entering into foreign currency contracts or currency matching to help manage currency risk.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
There is currently no requirement for borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of total recognised income and expense.
c Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
Counterparties for cash deposits are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating.

There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Groups financial instruments in the current or the preceding year.
f Hedging activities The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US Dollar and Euro, reecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenues and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are in Sterling and Swedish Kroner.
The Group reduces these exchange risks, where possible, by currency hedging.
The Group enters into specic forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash ows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euro to match forecast cash ows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
At 31 March 2007 the Group held the following forward exchange contracts.
The terms of these contracts are as follows: Forward contracts to sell Maturity Exchange rate US$ 2,000,000 30 June 2006 1 $1.7664 US$ 1,000,000 29 September 2006 1 $1.7691 The Group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.
