Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation easyJets the Groups or the Companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However the consolidated financial statements for the years presented would be no different had the Group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
These financial statements are prepared on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
Significant judgements, estimates and critical accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.
The following two accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of management judgement and the results are material to easyJets financial statements.
Aircraft maintenance provisions easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of its aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease.
These arise from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
To discharge these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe during the lease term.
A charge is made in the income statement based on hours or cycles flown to provide for the cost of these obligations.
Estimates required include the likely utilisation of the aircraft, the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur, the condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts.
The bases of all estimates are reviewed once each year, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material change to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or unanticipated changes in the cost of heavy maintenance services.
Corporation tax In drawing up the financial statements, estimates are made of current and deferred corporation tax assets and liabilities for each jurisdiction in which easyJet operates.
These estimates are affected by transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination was uncertain at the time the financial statements were finalised.
The issues involved are often complex and may take an extended period to resolve.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years, made up to 30 September 2006 and 2007, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associates, adjusted where appropriate to conform with easyJets accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities.
A minority interest is the portion of the profit or loss and net assets of a subsidiary attributable to equity interests that are not owned, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, by the Company.
Associates are those entities in which easyJet has significant influence, but not control over the financial and operating policies.
They are accounted for using the equity method.
Intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline services, net of air passenger duty, VAT and discounts, plus ancillary and advertising revenue.
Passenger revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in trade and other payables.
Ancillary revenue includes: credit card fees, baggage charges, speedy boarding fees, sporting equipment fees, infant fees, change fees and rescue fees: profit share from in flight sales of food, beverages and boutique items: commissions received from products and services sold such as hotel and car hire bookings, and travel insurance, less chargebacks.
These are recognised on the date that the right to receive consideration occurs.
Amounts paid by no-show customers are recognised as revenue in the period in which the booked service is provided as such customers are not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed.
easyJet plc 62 Annual report and accounts 2007 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, deposits maturing in between three months and one year, or deposits maturing in greater than one year.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception, less any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their use, all of which expire in more than three months from inception of the deposit.
Classification of restricted cash as a current or non-current asset is based on the remaining length of the restriction governing its use.
Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value of net proceeds, and subsequently at amortised cost which is based on the effective interest rate method.
Investments in equity instruments are carried at cost where fair value cannot be reliably measured due to significant variability in the range of reasonable fair value estimates.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value of net proceeds, and subsequently at amortised cost which is based on the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of borrowings includes unamortised issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments are used by easyJet to hedge its exposure to movements in currency exchange rates and jet fuel prices, as well as for translation protection of balance sheet assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are stated at fair value.
All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes to fair values are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Where the hedged item results in a non financial asset, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised e. g. through expiry or disposal, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in equity until the transaction takes place, when they are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses previously recognised in equity are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Where derivatives have been entered into for translation protection of balance sheet assets and liabilities, hedge accounting is not applied.
Movements in fair values of these instruments are taken to the income statement in the month that they occur, to set off gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to financial risks and its strategies for managing those risks are discussed in the treasury management section of the financial review.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which an easyJet subsidiary operates determines its functional currency.
The functional currency of easyJet plc is considered to be Sterling.
Certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than Sterling.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to reserves until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the exchange is recognised in income.
Under IFRS 1, exchange differences arising prior to 1 October 2004 are deemed to be nil.
Profits and losses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
Leases Non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
A number of operating leases require the Group to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates: these are expensed as incurred.
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells to a third party rights to acquire aircraft.
On delivery of the aircraft, easyJet subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of operating lease.
Surpluses arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value, are recognised in deferred income and amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the asset.
Purchase rights being the amount of pre-delivery deposits paid for aircraft that are expected to be sold and leased back are monetary assets and are included within trade and other receivables.
easyJet plc 63 Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset recognised.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are included in interest payable and other financing charges.
Aircraft maintenance provisions The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance leased aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
easyJet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases.
Provisions to meet the cost of these obligations are charged to the income statement calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated, based on the estimated future costs of major airframe, certain engine maintenance checks and costs incurred at the end of each lease.
These costs are discounted to present value where the amount of the discount is considered material.
A number of leases also require easyJet to pay supplemental rent to the lessor.
Payments may be either a fixed monthly sum up to a cap or are based on usage.
The purpose of these payments is to provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease.
Supplemental rent is either refunded when qualifying heavy maintenance is performed, or is offset against the costs incurred at the end of the lease.
Where the amount of supplemental rent paid exceeds the estimated amount recoverable from the lessor, provision is made for the non-recoverable amount.
Re-presentation In previous accounting periods, recoverable supplemental rent was offset against the related maintenance provisions as this properly reflects the commercial substance of the agreement with the lessor.
To provide additional information, recoverable supplemental rent is now reported gross within either current or non-current assets according to when the refund is expected to be received.
Comparative figures for other non-current assets, trade and other receivables and maintenance provisions have been adjusted accordingly.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives to the Group.
Expected useful lives are reviewed annually.
Period of depreciation Aircraft 23 years Aircraft improvements 3-7 years Aircraft prepaid maintenance 3-10 years Aircraft spares 14 years Leasehold improvements 5-10 years or the length of lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 years or length of lease of property where equipment is used Computer hardware 5 years During the year the expected useful life of aircraft spares has been extended from 10 to 14 years and of computer hardware from three to five years.
Items of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their expected useful lives, as shown above.
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.
The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is amortised over a period ranging from three to ten years from the date of manufacture.
Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines are capitalised and amortised over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements.
All other costs relating to maintenance are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The cost of new aircraft comprises the invoiced price of the aircraft from the supplier less the estimated value of other assets received by easyJet for nil consideration.
These assets principally comprise cash recognised as an asset and aircraft spares capitalised at list price and depreciated over their expected useful life.
The resulting credits are allocated equally to the cost of each aircraft on delivery.
Advance payments and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire aircraft where the balance is expected to be funded by cash reserves or mortgage financing are recorded at cost.
On acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that date.
Goodwill Where the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the separable net assets acquired, the resulting goodwill is capitalised.
Goodwill has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for impairment annually or where indicators imply that the carrying value is not recoverable.
easyJet plc 64 Annual report and accounts 2007 Other intangible assets Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
It is amortised on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life of three years.
Impairment of assets Assets with an indefinite useful life or subject to amortisation or depreciation Assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
The expected cash flows generated by the assets are discounted using appropriate discount rates, which reflect the risks associated with the groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses recognised on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed.
Financial assets Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that a loss has been incurred.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed.
Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the income statement as components of net financing income.
Employee benefits easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Group contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related service is provided.
Taxation including deferred tax The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using taxation rates that are applicable to the taxable income.
Deferred taxation is recognised in profit or loss except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, taxation in the future.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and taxation credits carried forwards.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be deducted.
Deferred taxation liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit.
Deferred taxation arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is not recognised where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Share-based payments easyJet has a number of equity-settled share-based payment compensation plans.
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at the date of grant using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model.
The fair value of the estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period that employees services are rendered.
If it becomes reasonably certain that performance criteria attached to the share options will not be met, the cumulative expense previously recognised for those options is reversed.
easyJet plc 65 65 Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1, easyJet has not applied this fair value calculation to share option grants that were made before 7 November 2002, but which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The cost of shares that are held by employee benefit trusts, and that are not allocated to specific grants of shares to employees, is deducted from equity.
Segmental disclosures The Group has only one business segment: the provision of a low-cost airline service within Europe.
The Group has only one geographical segment relating to the origin of its turnover which is Europe.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries and associates that are not classified as held for sale are stated at cost in the entity financial statements.
Assets held for resale Where assets are available for sale in their current condition, and their disposal is highly probable, they are reclassified as held for resale.
Assets held for resale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and the fair value less costs to sell.
Depreciation on assets held for resale ceases at the point of their reclassification from fixed assets.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations that have not been applied in preparing these financial statements as their effective dates are for periods beginning after 1 October 2006.

As a result the net deferred tax liability is 34.6 million 2006: 31.7 million, which comprises a deferred tax liability of 35.0 million offset by a deferred tax asset of 0.4 million.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.
There are no tax losses available for use in either the current or the prior year.
easyJet plc 69 Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year retained for equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for shares held by the Group in employee share option trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.
Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.
Earnings per share is based on: 2007 2006 million million Profit for the year 152.3 94.1 Reversal of prior year impairment losses on financial assets 10.6 Related deferred taxation 3.0 Underlying profit for the year 144.7 94.1 millions millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year used to calculate basic earnings per share 416.0 405.7 Weighted average number of dilutive share options used to calculate diluted earnings per share 12.2 9.7 Earnings per share 2007 2006 pence pence Basic 36.62 23.18 Diluted 35.58 22.64 Underlying earnings per share non-GAAP measure 2007 2006 pence pence Basic 34.79 23.18 Diluted 33.80 22.64 Underlying profit and earnings per share are based on the profit for the year after adding back the reversal of impairment on financial assets and related taxation.
The adjustment has been made on the grounds that the credit relates to several prior years and will not recur.
Further details are given in note 12a.
7 Goodwill 2007 million Cost and net book value at 1 October 2006 and 30 September 2007 309.6 Goodwill arose on the purchases of TEA Basel and Go Fly.
easyJet has only one cash generating unit, which is its airline network.
Goodwill arising through business combinations all relates to this one cash generating unit.
The recoverability of goodwill has been determined based on value in use.
This has been assessed by applying cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by the Board.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 9.8% 2006: 11.3%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Operating margin and discount rate.
Operating margins and growth rates are based on the estimated effects of planned business efficiency and operational growth, however the trading environment is subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections to a significant enough extent to result in the carrying value of the network failing to exceed its recoverable amount.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of the long-term return on capital employed for the business.
Changes in sources of funding or the cost of the funding could result in changes to discount rates used.
The discount rate would need to exceed 20% in order for there to be a significant risk that the carrying amount of assets would exceed their recoverable amount.

The net book value of aircraft at 30 September 2007 includes 116.0 million 2006: 81.2 million relating to advance payments and option payments for future delivery of aircraft.
This amount is not depreciated.
The net book value of aircraft held under finance leases at 30 September 2007 was 77.8 million 2006 80.9 million.
3.3 million of the related accumulated depreciation was charged in the year ended 30 September 2007 2006: 1.8 million.
At 30 September 2007, aircraft with a net book value of 517.5 million 2006: 418.0 million were mortgaged to lenders as loan security.

12 Investments a Investment in The Airline Group In March 2001, easyJet in consortium with six other UK airlines formed The Airline Group Limited in order to acquire a minority interest in NATS, the company that owns the UK air traffic control system.
At 30 September 2001, easyJets investment totalled 7.2 million.
This comprised equity of 10,080, loan notes of 6.8 million, bid costs of 0.1 million and accrued interest of 0.3 million.
The loan notes are of two classes bearing interest at fixed rates of 8% and 11%.
The blended interest rate is 8.07%.
During the year ended 30 September 2002 the carrying value of the investment was impaired to zero.
This impairment was taken due to uncertainty over the timing of returns to easyJet following the events of 11 September 2001.
On 28 June 2007, NATS reported its results for the year ended 31 March 2007 showing a fourth consecutive year of profits, and announced that it would recommence paying dividends in July 2007.
As a consequence the present value of estimated future cash flows from easyJets investment in the loan notes exceeds their carrying value, and the impairment was reversed in July.
The impairment of the equity investment has not been reversed as its fair value cannot be reliably measured due to significant variability in the range of reasonable estimates.
Accordingly the equity continues to be measured at zero, being cost less impairments booked in prior years.
The impairment reversal relating to prior years comprises: million Reinstatement of original loan notes and acquisition costs 6.9 Interest earned to 30 September 2006 3.7 10.6 The impairment reversal relating to prior years is separately disclosed in the face of the income statement as it is a significant one-off item.
A further 0.6 million of interest earned between October 2006 and July 2007 is included within interest receivable and other financing income.
The loan notes fall within the category of loans and receivables, and their fair value is equal to net book value.

i Employee Share Option Schemes The easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme The share options vested in tranches of 25% ending on the third anniversary of admission to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority.
The options expire ten years after grant.
Substantially all of the employees accepted employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the first tranche of options.
It is a condition of those options granted since March 2000 that the option holders accept liability for the employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the options.
An easyJet Supplemental Flotation Share Option Scheme was established in respect of both UK and Swiss employees to grant options to a number of participants.
The easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2000 An initial award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in January 2001 to eligible employees of SR Technics easyTech Limited, a 25% associate of easyJet Airline Company Limited with a three-year vesting period and no performance criteria.
This award was made in connection with the admission of easyJet plc to the Official List.
Further awards were made between 2001 and 2005.
The options have a three-year vesting period, expire ten years after grant, and are subject to performance criteria.
The easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme Awards were made between 2001 and 2005 on terms that meet Inland Revenue requirements for an Approved share option scheme.
The options have a three-year vesting period expire ten years after grant, and are subject to the same performance criteria as the non-approved scheme.
ii Sharesave Scheme This scheme is open to all UK resident employees.
Participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three-year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a price based on the market price of the shares at the time of the grant.
At the end of the savings period, a tax-free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
Options have been granted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 at a discount of 20% to the market price.
For those employees who are not paid through the UK payroll, similar terms and conditions apply to the UK scheme, albeit without the UK tax benefits.
iii Share Incentive Plan The scheme is open to all employees.
Employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum, to purchase shares in easyJet through a partnership scheme without paying national insurance contributions or income tax.
For every share purchased through the partnership scheme, easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain in employment with easyJet three years from the date of purchase of the first share in order to qualify for the second matching share, and for five years for the partnership shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee retains rights over both partnership and matching shares, and is entitled to dividends and to vote at meetings.
In October 2006, the Company granted free shares to all employees at 1 August 2006 under this scheme.
The value of shares allocated to each employee was equal to two weeks salary, with a minimum award of 600 and a maximum of 3,000. iv Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is open, by invitation, to the Executive Management Team and Senior Management Group SMG.
The LTIP has been structured to provide for regular annual awards of a performance shares worth up to 100% of salary each year up to 50% for SMG and b matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
The vesting of these awards is dependent on return on equity targets being achieved.
In addition the LTIP provides for a one-off FTSE 100 award to senior executives.
This award is structured so that, if easyJet becomes a member of the FTSE 100 index for a period of at least six months before the end of the financial year ending 30 September 2008, participants will receive easyJet shares worth up to 100% of salary.
easyJet plc 77 Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Share-based payments continued v Chief Executive Matching Award In December 2005, on Andrew Harrison acquiring and retaining 1,000,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds, he was granted an equal number of shares.
50% of this matching share award vests three years after grant subject to performance conditions relating to the growth in EPS over the three years.
The other 50% of this matching award vests three years after grant subject to the same ROE targets as the LTIP.
Exercise prices for these options lie between 1.61 and 3.65.
During the year the share options issued under the discretionary scheme on 19 January 2004 became exercisable.
Options over 1,042,429 shares did not vest as the performance conditions were not fully satisfied.
All other movements shown in the forfeited lapsed column in the table relate to forfeitures.
The weighted average share price for options exercised during the year was 6.10 2006: 3.93 The weighted average remaining contractual life for each class of share award is as follows: Years Pre-flotation scheme 2.5 Discretionary schemes 7.2 Sharesave 1.6 Long term incentive plan 1.7 Share incentive plan 3.9 Free shares 2.2 Chief Executive matching award 1.4 easyJet plc 78 Annual report and accounts 2007 The fair value of grants under the discretionary and sharesave schemes is estimated by applying a binomial option pricing model using the following assumptions.
The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant.
Exercise price for the discretionary schemes was determined using a five-day weighted average price.
For the Sharesave scheme, a 20% discount has been given between share price and exercise price.
Expected volatility is based on recent historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option.
In all cases the dividend yield assumed is 0% as easyJet does not pay dividends.
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
