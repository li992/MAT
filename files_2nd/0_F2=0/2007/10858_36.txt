Due to the proximity of the combination to the year end the Group has been unable to complete a detailed valuation of the intangible and property, plant and equipment acquired with the business.
Accordingly, the surplus of consideration over fair value of the share of net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill at 31 December 2007.
The Group expects to identify intangible assets, including brands, customer relationships and customer contracts, and will complete a property valuation.
Independent valuers have been retained by the Group to complete this exercise and the results will be reflected in the Groups next financial statements.
The value of goodwill will be adjusted by a corresponding amount for the fair value of intangible assets identified and the difference between the market and book values of the property assets.
From the date of acquisition, Continental Auto has contributed 5.8m to the operating profit of the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the operating profit for the Group would have been 216.1m and revenue from continuing operations would have been 2,711.4m.
