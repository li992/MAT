It is anticipated that intangible assets arising on the acquisition of voice broking businesses have a finite life.
The Group reviews the performance of the businesses and reassesses the likely period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to add value to the business each year.
As a result some businesses will have no impairment in a particular year while others will.
The Group has booked an impairment in the year of 11.2m relating to First Brokers and the Acquired Asian Businesses.
In the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 5.0m in respect of the pre-acquisition tax losses of ICAP Electronic Broking that previously did not meet the criteria to be recognised.
A corresponding reduction in the goodwill relating to ICAP Electronic Broking of 5.0m was charged to administrative expenses in the income statement within amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation.
