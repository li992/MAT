The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and expected changes to revenues and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks in relation to the CGUs.
Changes in revenues and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash ow forecasts for the next two years derived from the most recent budget information.
Cash ows are extrapolated thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 8%.
