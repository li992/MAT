Highlights&Overview Business&Financialreview Directors report Financial statements Other information The franchise intangible and customer relationships relate to the acquisition of CSBG and other bottling operations.
See Note 31 for further information about the acquisitions.
No amortisation is charged on franchise rights acquired through acquisitions where the rights relate to brands owned by the Group and these brands have been assigned an indefinite life.
This is because the Group believes that these rights will extend indefinitely.
Franchise rights to brands not owned by the Group are amortised consistent with the life of the contract.
Customer relationships are amortised over their expected useful life which is between 5 to 10 years.
The amortisation period for software intangibles is no greater than 8 years.
The Group tests indefinite life brand intangibles annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the brand intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the brand intangibles.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next four years and extrapolates cash flows for no more than five years, using a steady growth rate applicable to the relevant market between 2% and 6%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
