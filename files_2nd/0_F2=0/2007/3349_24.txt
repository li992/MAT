10 Contingent liabilities Since about 1985, Charter, its principal subsidiary Charter Consolidated PLC, and certain of their wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants in asbestos-related actions in the United States.
These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter.
Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in Charters favour either at trial or on appeal.
In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestosrelated lawsuits.
Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals.
Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charters operating profits in 2007 were negligible.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make any provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
