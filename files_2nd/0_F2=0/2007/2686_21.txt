The success weve achieved thus far has been and Joint Group Managing Director due to the efforts of everyone in the business so Id like to express my gratitude to my colleagues.
Their calibre and energy especially through tough times is impressive.
Put simply, weve built a reliable business.
Were two-thirds of the way through our customer reduction programme: winning more business than we anticipated and with a more reasonable mix of more sustainable revenues: service is improving and were creating a customer-centric culture that values its people.
Weve exited consumer broadband with the sale of the Bulldog retail customer base and moved to a wholesale approach for our local loop capability an asset which gives us a competitive advantage.
Our strategy We serve the largest Famous for a great telecoms users both here service experience and internationally Valuable for customers With high quality managed and economic for us IP services 11 Europe, Asia & US continued Telecoms customers have been forced to suffer poor service from our industry for too long.
Our ambition is to change that.
Were investing in our people.
Were all about giving good service to customers.
Delivering that ambition relies on having happy, motivated people.
Were putting all our energy into ensuring our people can do their jobs well and were busy creating a company where people aspire to work.
21st century businesses require new and different things from their communications suppliers.
Under our banner of A New Way Everywhere, were re-designing every aspect of our business based on what our customers want.

This is a result of organic growth in our services customers, migration of customers from legacy data products to IP and a reduction in traditional voice.
Total revenue increased by 91 million to 2,119 million in 2006 07.
This is largely due to the inclusion of a full year of Energis in 2006 07.
This has more than offset the impact of the anticipated churn and erosion encountered in restructuring the business to focus on larger, more profitable customers.
Total operating costs of 1,960 million are 81 million higher than in 2005 06 as a result of the increased cost base following the Energis acquisition, but have reduced as a proportion of revenue.
EBITDA has increased by 7% to 159 million.
The Cash LTIP charge of 17 million was in line with our 59% increase in shareholder return.
14 Revenue Depreciation and amortisation of 104 million in 2006 07 is lower than in 2005 06, mainly as a result of an impairment of our fixed assets at the end of 2005 06 2,040m 2005 06.
2006 07 2,139m We recognised exceptional charges of 60 million principally related to the ongoing restructuring of our business.
EBITDA In 2006 07, total capital expenditure was 204 million.
We continued to invest according to our customers needs 2005 06 44m and spent 63 million on customer-specific projects, representing a relative increase in customer capital 2006 07 84m expenditure compared to 2005 06 from 29% to 31%.
Our net cash outflow before financing for the year was 162 million.
The cash outflow for the year principally IP, data and hosting revenue reflects EBITDA of 159 million, exceptional items and provisions relating to restructuring costs of 60 million, 2005 06 25% working capital and other provisions movement of 74 million and capital expenditure of 186 million.
2006 07 34% C&W Access Excludes C&W Access Following the sale of our retail customer base to Pipex in September 2006, our revenue is now primarily generated from our wholesale agreements.
Revenue of 43 million in 2006 07 is 10 million higher than 2005 06 and reflects the increase in our average end user base over the year.
Operating costs fell by 22 million to 116 million in line with our cost reduction programmes.
EBITDA improved by 32 million to a loss of 73 million.
Exceptional costs of 29 million include 5 million for restructuring activities, a 13 million write off of redundant IT assets, and the write off of 20 million of the Bulldog intangible assets offset by 9 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the Bulldog retail customer base.
This resulted in a net operating loss of 128 million for the year.
Our net cash outflow for the year was 110 million.
Our turnaround is showing good progress.
But we are only part way through our journey.
