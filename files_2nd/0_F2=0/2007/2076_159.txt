Amounts shown in the following table exclude interest income and financial expenses, and general corporate administrative costs.
Petroleum general and administrative costs relating to oil and gas activities are included.
Income taxes were determined by applying the applicable statutory rates to pre-tax income with adjustments for permanent differences and tax credits.
Certain allocations of tax provisions among geographic areas were necessary and are based on managements assessment of the principal factors giving rise to the tax obligation.
Revenues are reflected net of royalties but before deduction of production taxes.
Revenues include sales to affiliates but amounts are not significant.

278 BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2007 5260 BHPB AReport Pt3 10 9 07 4:55 PM Page 279 Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves Standardised measure The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised measure is based on the BHP Billiton Groups estimated proved reserves, as presented in section 2.13.1 Petroleum Reserves and this data should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section.
The Standardised measure is prepared on a basis which presumes that year end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year end proved reserves would be produced.
The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates and expected future changes in technology, taxes and operating practices have not been included.
The Standardised measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing that future production at prices in effect at year end to derive future cash inflows.
Future price increases may be considered only to the extent that they are provided by fixed contractual arrangements in effect at year end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate changes.
Future cash inflows are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the year end proved reserves based on costs in effect at year end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices.
Future development costs include the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves owned at year end.
They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of production platforms and restoration of drilling sites.
Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect at year end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at year end.
The resultant annual future net cash flows after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes are discounted at 10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised measure.
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised measure, the most important of which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof.
The Standardised measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of the BHP Billiton Groups oil and gas reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and gas.
b Future costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves over the next three years are expected to be US$2,086 million 2008, US$1,530 million 2009 and US$734 million 2010.

The beginning of year and end of year totals are shown after reduction for income taxes and these, together with the changes in income tax amounts, are shown as discounted amounts at 10 per cent per annum.
