Consolidated Financial Statements 9 Goodwill continued A sensitivity analysis had been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of UniEuro and FotoVista, the forecasts are most sensitive to managements five years projections.
It is reasonably possible that a change in these assumptions could occur over the course of the next financial period.
For UniEuro a decrease of 1.0 per cent in the compound annual growth rate in pre-tax profits over this five year period would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use by 0.8 million.
For FotoVista, the same 1.0 per cent decrease in compound annual growth rate would cause the current headroom of 18.1 million to erode by 4.4 million.
