OUR ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The Company-only financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Companys results are included in the consolidated financial statements of Cookson Group plc, a company registered in the United Kingdom.
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Cookson Group plc group.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in relation to the Company-only financial statements.
2.1 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
2.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of marketbased conditions, such as a Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditioned, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
2.3 PENSION COSTS The Company participates in a UK-wide Group pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.4 POST-RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan.
The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not funded and the amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method.
2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Differences arising from the translation, at closing rates, of loans to overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, foreign currency borrowings, trading and other items are taken to the profit and loss account.
2.6 BORROWING COSTS Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 2.7 INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES Shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment in value.
2.8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts to manage the Companys exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on retranslation of the Companys subsidiaries net assets on consolidation.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value, which is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
At each subsequent balance sheet date, forward foreign exchange contracts are measured at their quoted market price at the balance sheet date with any change in fair value being recognised in the profit and loss account.
2.9 PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.

SHARE CAPITAL continued In October 2007, the Company issued 18,583,519 new 10p ordinary shares through a share placing at a price of 825p per ordinary share.
The issue raised 150.6m net of issue costs.
During the year, the Company issued 621,008 new 10p ordinary shares in connection with its share option schemes.
The cancellation of the deferred shares became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of the High Court with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of 356.5m on the account became a non-distributable reserve of the Company reported within other reserves note 15.
This reserve becomes distributable only at such time when all external creditors of the Company as at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have agreed that this reserve may be deemed distributable.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time, are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company and rank equally with regard to entitlement to the Companys residual assets.
SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT m As at 1 January 2006 645.5 Cancellation of share premium 646.9 Arising on exercise of share options 7.7 As at 1 January 2007 6.3 Arising on exercise of share options 1.7 As at 31 December 2007 8.0 The 2006 cancellation of the share premium account became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of the High Court with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of 646.9m on the account became a nondistributable reserve of the Company reported within other retained earnings note 15.

A cash box structure was utilised to effect the share placing, as a result of which Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 applied to the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued and consequently no share premium was recognised.
The excess net proceeds of 148.8m were recorded as a merger reserve that was subsequently transferred to retained earnings and which is available for distribution to shareholders.
During 2006, the Company entered into a High Court sanctioned capital reduction scheme that resulted in the creation of 1,003.4m of non-distributable reserves.
Under the terms of the reduction, the Company is permitted to release from these reserves as realised profit, an amount equal in value to the amount by which the Companys share capital and share premium account are increased, subsequent to the reduction, as a result of an issue of shares.
Since the date of the reduction, the Companys share capital and share premium have increased by 10.2m as a result of share issues and this amount has been transferred to distributable reserves.

RESERVES continued Treasury shares As at 1 January 2007, 0.8m ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company were held by Cookson Investments Jersey Limited, as Trustee of the Cookson Group Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP, with a nominal value of 0.1m, which were purchased at a gross cost of 8.4m.
During the year 0.2m shares were utilised by the ESOP to meet share option obligations and accordingly 3.1m has been transferred from the treasury shares reserve to retained earnings.
As at 31 December 2007, the number of ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company so held in trust was 0.6m, having a nominal value of 0.1m, which were purchased at a gross cost of 5.3m.
The purchase of these shares was financed by the Company out of borrowings included in the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2007.
The market value of these shares as at 31 December 2007 was 4.4m 2006: 4.9m.
The Trustee of the ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends on the shares held.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 17.1 PENSION PLANS The Company participates in a UK-wide Group defined benefit pension scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and therefore accounts for its membership of the scheme as it would for a defined contribution scheme.
Costs charged in the year in respect of its contributions payable to the scheme were 4.6m 2006: 4.5m.
The pension scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme reach retirement.
The last full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out as at 31 December 2006.
At that date, the market value of the plan assets was 278.3m, representing 78% of accrued plan benefits at the time using the projected unit method of valuation of 356.6m.
Calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 475.7m, representing a funding level of 59%.
The 2006 full valuation has been updated, as appropriate, in order to estimate the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2007, at which date the market value of the plan assets was 318.1m 2006: 278.3m, representing 92% 2006: 78% of estimated accrued plan benefits of 345.4m 2006: 356.6m.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to 0.1m 2006: 0.1m.
There were no outstanding contributions payable to the scheme as at 31 December 2007 31 December 2006: nil.
17.2 POST-EMPLOYMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan.
The costs of providing these benefits are not funded.
The level of the accrued plan benefits provision is based on independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of the plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out at 31 December 2007, at which date the accrued plan benefits were 1.3m 2006: 3.8m: 2005: 4.9m: 2004: 4.2m: 2003: 4.5m.
During the year changes were made to the post-retirement healthcare plan which resulted in a reduction of the costs borne by the Company in order to meet its liabilities under the plan.
As a result of these changes a curtailment credit arose of 1.0m, reducing the plan benefits accrual.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2007 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to 39.7m 31 December 2006: 34.8m and guarantees under property leases of discontinued operations amounted to 3.2m 31 December 2006: 2.6m.
In addition, on behalf of its subsidiaries the Company has given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to 344.1m 2006: 235.6m, representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at 31 December 2007.
Further details of these consignment arrangements are given in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cookson has extensive international operations and several of its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved.
While the outcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
