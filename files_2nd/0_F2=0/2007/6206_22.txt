Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 14 Intangible assets continued Sensitivity to change in assumptions Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the Foundry unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the ongoing Steel unit there are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Steel unit has a smaller customer base than the Foundry unit and is more dependent on its key customers.
Management recognises that the loss or substantial reduction of the business from one or more key customers, or the impact of price reductions arising from consolidation in the Steel industry, could potentially have an adverse impact on the forecasts.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of Steel's assets by 33.9 million.
A 12% reduction in the long term gross profit per annum assumed in the projections would give a value in use equal to the carrying amount of the Steel unit.
Despite the risks noted above, management are confident of the achievability of the cash flow projections.
