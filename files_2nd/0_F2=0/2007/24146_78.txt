These are identified as the 2003 STICS and the 2005 STICS.
Under IFRS, it is necessary to treat STICS as equity as there is no requirement to settle the obligation in cash or another financial asset.
Interest and dividends on instruments classified as equity are not treated as expenses but as an appropriation of profit.
The Group considers that the commercial intent of the instruments is debt, accordingly the interest is included in the underlying profit calculation of the Group.
