Tax continued Provision has been made in current tax for the 17.7 million of French tax arising on the sale in the year of the company owning 9 place Vendme.
Deferred tax of 28.7 million, which had been calculated on the basis of a sale of the property, has been written back.
The group continues to carry full provision for the 38.0 million of tax 2006: 38.0 million and 14.3 million interest 2006: 11.3 million relating to capital gains incurred by the Grantchester Group prior to its acquisition by Hammerson in 2002 in respect of which the tax authorities are disputing whether capital losses can be utilised.
In January 2008, the High Court decided in favour of HM Revenue & Customs following which the tax and interest has become payable.
The Company is seeking leave to appeal and, should the decision ultimately be overturned, the total of 52.3 million will be released.
e. unreCognised deferred Tax Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the group can control whether gains crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2007 the total of such gains was 1,200 million and the potential tax effect 336 million 2006: 900 million, potential tax effect 270 million.
If a UK REIT sells a property completed after 1 January 2007 within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply.
The group had no such properties at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
A deferred tax asset of 17.7 million 2006: 8.2 million is not recognised for carried forward UK tax losses that may not be utilised, because it is uncertain whether appropriate taxable profits will arise.
f. uK reiT sTaTus The group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the groups UK property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or, for properties completed after 1 January 2007, sold within three years after completion of development.
The group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax.
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the groups exempted net income.
On entering the REIT regime, entry tax became payable equal to 2% of the market value of the groups qualifying UK properties at 31 December 2006.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 provided for this entry charge in current tax and showed the corresponding release of deferred tax relating to UK capital gains and UK capital allowances.
The total entry charge provided was 100.5 million and is being paid in quarterly instalments between July 2007 and April 2008.
To remain a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the group, the groups qualifying activity and its balance of business which are set out in the UK REIT legislation in the Finance Act 2006. g. frenCh siiC sTaTus Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the French properties, with the exception of 9 place Vendme which was sold in 2007, are within the SIIC tax-exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which will then pay UK dividends to its shareholders.
Under current UK tax rules, Hammerson plc will be taxed in the UK on dividends received from France, subject to available UK tax losses.
If all the properties were realised at their 31 December 2007 values, a total of 517 million of dividends would arise 2006: 324 million, and deferred tax of 144.8 million 2006: 97.2 million is provided for the potential UK tax thereon.
Dividend obligations will arise after property disposals but there will be a period of approximately four years after a sale before dividends are required to be received in the UK.
Under the SIIC qualifying conditions, Hammerson plc must continue to be listed in France and at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment.
If the conditions are breached before 2014, the original conversion charge would be recalculated at full rates giving an additional 74 million tax cost.
9. dividends The proposed final dividend of 15.3 pence per share 2006: 15.3 pence per share was recommended by the Board on 25 February 2008 and, subject to approval by shareholders, is payable on 23 May 2008 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 11 April 2008.
It is intended that 7.7 pence per share will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, and the remainder of 7.6 pence per share will be paid as a normal dividend.
Based on the proposed final dividend, the total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 will be 27.3 pence per share 2006: 21.68 pence per share.
The 79.1 million dividend included in the reconciliation of equity on page 72 comprises the 2006 final dividend of 44.3 million, which was paid on 14 May 2007, together with the 2007 interim dividend of 34.8 million.
The latter was paid on 19 October 2007 as a PID, and was subject to withholding tax of 6.0 million, which was paid on 14 January 2008.
