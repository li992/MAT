3 Includes the fair value movement in relation to the potential put rights held by Telecom Egypt over its 25.5% interest in Vodafone Egypt and the fair value of a financial liability in relation to the minority partners of Arcor, the Groups non-mobile operation in Germany.
Following the sale of 16.9% of Vodafone Egypt to Telecom Egypt in the 2005 financial year, the Group signed a shareholder agreement with Telecom Egypt setting out the basis under which the Group and Telecom Egypt would each contribute a 25.5% interest in Vodafone Egypt to a newly formed company to be 50% owned by each party.
Within this shareholder agreement, Telecom Egypt was granted a put option over its entire interest in Vodafone Egypt giving Telecom Egypt the right to put its shares back to the Group at deemed fair value.
In the 2006 financial year, the shareholder agreement between Telecom Egypt and Vodafone expired and the associated rights and obligations contained in the shareholder agreement terminated, including the aforementioned put option.
However, the original shareholders agreement contained an obligation on both parties to use reasonable efforts to renegotiate a revised shareholder agreement for their direct shareholding in Vodafone Egypt on substantially the same terms as the original agreement.
During the year, the parties agreed to abandon such efforts and as such the financial liability relating to the initial shareholder agreement was released from the Groups balance sheet.
Fair value movements are determined by reference to the quoted share price of Vodafone Egypt.
For the 2007 financial year, a credit of 34 million was recognised.
The capital structure of Arcor provides all partners, including Vodafone, the right to withdraw capital from 31 December 2026 onwards and this right in relation to the minority partners has been recognised as a financial liability.
Fair value movements are determined by reference to a calculation of enterprise value of the partnership.
For the year ended 31 March 2007, a charge of 23 million 2006: 56 million: 2005: nil was recognised.
The valuation of these financial liabilities is inherently unpredictable and changes in the fair value could have a material impact on the future results and financial position of Vodafone.
4 Changes in the fair value of equity put rights and similar arrangements and foreign exchange are included in investment income and financing costs.
5 Comprises the foreign exchange reflected in the income statement in relation to certain intercompany balances, and the foreign exchange on financial instruments received as consideration in the disposal of Vodafone Japan to SoftBank, which completed in April 2006.
