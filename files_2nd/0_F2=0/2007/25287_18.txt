The address of the registered office is on page 84.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors report on page 30.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: Accounting periods commencing after International Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRSs IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 07 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 09 Amendment to IAS 1 Capital Disclosures IFRS 7 and SORIE Amendments to IAS 19 1 January 07 IAS 23 revised March 2007 Borrowing Costs 1 January 09 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 06 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 06 IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 06 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 07 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 08 2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified to include the fair valuation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its principal subsidiaries made up to 31 March.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Company balance sheet at cost less provision for impairments.
d Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
A presumption of significant influence is made when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting rights of an investee.
However, the Group reviews each investment and if it is concluded that the Group does not have significant influence, then the equity investment is held as an available for sale asset.
Annual Report and Accounts Intermediate Capital Group PLC 55 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued e Interest income and expense Interest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost are measured using the effective interest rate method, which allocates the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument.
The expected life of an instrument is estimated by the relevant Investment Executive using knowledge gained from the close monitoring of the investment and their presence on the board.
f Fee income and expense Fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided and include fund management fees and arrangement fees.
Fees integral to the loan yield, including underwriting and agency fees, are included within interest income as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Fees payable on the arrangement of balance sheet funding are included within interest expense as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Other fees are generally expensed as incurred.
g Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
h Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
i Pension costs Pension liabilities are provided for by payments to insurance companies or to individuals for employees private pension plans.
The amount charged to the income statement represents a percentage of the current payroll cost paid to defined contribution schemes.
j Value added tax Irrecoverable VAT is written off on items of expenditure relating to the income statement.
VAT on tangible fixed assets is capitalised and written off over a similar period to the asset to which it relates.
k Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated using the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
The income and expense items are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Foreign currency monetary transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
The treasury policies of the Group are described in more detail in note 28.
56 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2 Significant accounting policies continued l Taxation Provision is made for taxation at the currently enacted rates on taxable profits, arising in income or in equity, taking into account relief for overseas taxation where appropriate.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes and its carrying amount for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
m Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Furniture and equipment 20% 33% per annum Leasehold improvements 20% per annum n Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following categories, as determined at initial recognition: i Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives, which includes warrants and other derivatives held for risk management purposes, are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Changes in fair value are immediately recognised in the income statement.
ii Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They include loans made as part of the Groups operating activities as well as trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents.
iii Available-for-sale Available-for-sale assets are financial assets not classified in i or ii above and include listed bonds and listed and unlisted shares, see note 2 p below.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included as a separate component of equity until the sale or impairment, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, see note 2 e above.
o Impairment of financial assets A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of a fall in value of that asset as a result of events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If there is objective evidence of impairment for financial assets classified as available for sale, the loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Annual Report and Accounts Intermediate Capital Group PLC 57 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued p Shares and warrants Shares and warrants are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different basis, applying the valuation policies of ICG.
q Financial liabilities All financial liabilities, except for derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative liabilities are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges, see note 2 r below.
r Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are not considered to be closely related to the host contract, are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Derivatives can be designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
i Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in cash flows, such as variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The effective portion of changes in the derivative fair value is recognised in equity, and recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will effect profit or loss.
The fair value gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, such as fixed rate loans.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
If derivatives are not designated as hedges then changes in fair values are recognised immediately in the income statement.
s Significant estimates uncertainties The significant accounting estimates in these financial statements are considered to relate to the valuations of impaired assets, share based payment and the effective interest rate calculations.
The methodology for valuing impaired assets is as detailed in note 16 on page 66, for valuing share based payment is as detailed in note 24 on page 71 and for deciding upon the maturity date for the effective interest rate on loans and investments in note 2 e on page 56.
3 Profit of parent company As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the income statement of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The parent companys profit for the year amounted to 101.1m period ended 31 March 2006 98.2m.

As these instruments are all held in private companies with no ready market, the events to crystallise such a valuation include the sale of shares by a substantial shareholder or the approach of an exit to the transaction, either by way of a float or a sale.
Therefore, the fair valuing of such unquoted shares has been restricted to those instruments whose value may be reliably measured for example by one of the above events.
These instruments are otherwise held at cost.

These estimates take into account the level and quality of the customers earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the customer operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those recognised in the financial statements.

70 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 24 Share based payments continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in the period was 15.77 2006 11.7.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2007 have a range of exercise prices between 5.1 and 15.3 2006 4.8 and 12.1 as detailed below, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.5 years 2006 7.4 years.
The aggregate of estimated fair values of the options granted on these dates are 1.6m 2006 1.4m.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model are as follows: 5 December 1 June 30 April For options granted 2006 2006 2005 Exercise price 15.30 12.34 10.918 Expected volatility 18.51% 18.51% 19.42% Expected life 5.14 years 5.14 years 5.27 years Risk free rate 4.38% 4.38% 4.43% Dividend yield 3.80% 3.80% 3.6% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous two years.
The expected life used in the model has been calculated using actual exercise periods over the previous five years.
Key Employee Retention Share Plan KERSP 202,322 options were granted in the year under the KERSP plan with a nil exercise price.
All options granted were outstanding at the year-end.
None of these options are exercisable until May 2010.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of these options is 2m.
The inputs for the Black Scholes model are as follows: Exercise price nil Expected volatility 18.51% Expected life 6.0 years Risk free rate 4.38% Dividend yield 3.80% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous two years.
20% of the options under the KERSP vest each year between May 2010 and May 2014.
The expected life has thus been calculated by assuming that options are exercised as soon as they vest there being no exercise cost.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1.5m and 0.9m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2007 and 2006 respectively.

28 Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The Groups treasury policies seek to manage the following risks.
The Board has reviewed and agreed the changes in the policies during the year ended 31 March 2007. b Interest rate risk The Group provides mezzanine finance to its borrowers at both fixed and floating rates.
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, private placements and floating rate notes.
It seeks to match the interest profiles of assets and liabilities in order to reduce interest rate risk.
The Group uses financial derivatives to achieve this.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The following tables provide a summary of the interest rate repricing profile of the Groups and the Companys assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2007 and 2006.
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest reset date and the contractual maturity date.
The table includes the effect of derivatives which alter the interest basis of assets and liabilities.

Annual Report and Accounts Intermediate Capital Group PLC 75 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued c Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates for the translation of net assets, foreign currency transactions and the translation of net asset and profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the Euro and the US Dollar.
The Group finances its loans and investments by means of borrowings or synthetic borrowings in the respective currency invested.
In addition, derivative instruments are used to hedge a proportion of unrealised income recognised on a fair value basis.
Derivative instruments are used on a limited basis to reduce the Groups exposure to foreign currency movements on transactions.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.

d Liquidity risk The Groups policy has throughout the period been to ensure continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets, the policy is that, wherever possible, the majority of its debt should mature in more than five years.
This has been achieved by using a combination of private placements with maturities of between five and ten years, shortterm borrowings under a five year extendible, multi-currency bank facility and by issuing floating rate notes.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is shown within note 21. e Credit risk The Groups policy is to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.
The carrying amount of financial assets before any impairments best represents both the Group and Companys maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
Additional information on the concentrations of credit risk are provided by industry and country on page 26.

The total carrying amount of these instruments is 107.4m 2006 100.7m.
The fair value of these warrants cannot be reliably measured.
The range of estimates within which the aggregate fair value is highly likely to lie is 55m 130m 2006 50m 125m.
Apart from the unlisted shares and warrants, held at cost, the following methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair values are shown below: Loans and receivables Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the Directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
Annual Report and Accounts Intermediate Capital Group PLC 77 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued f Fair value continued Available for sale investments and warrants Fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions or an earning based valuation technique.
Where a reliable fair value cannot be established, these are held at cost.
Other derivatives The fair value of the over-the-counter derivatives is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the Directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.
