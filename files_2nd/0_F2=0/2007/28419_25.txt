Financial Parent company statements Notes on the parent company financial statements 1 Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in the UK, the US and Asia.
The Group operates in the UK through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited, M&G Investment Management Limited and, prior to disposal, Egg Banking plc.
On 29 January 2007 the Company announced that it had entered into a binding agreement to sell its Egg banking business to Citi, as described in note 4.
On 1 May 2007, the Company completed the sale.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In Asia, the Groups main operations are in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.
The Company is responsible for the financing of each of its subsidiaries.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985, which apply to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement on the basis that its cash flow is included within the cash flow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Group or investees of the Group.
FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures which replaces the disclosure requirements of FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation became effective in 2007.
Similar to the treatment adopted for FRS 25, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 29, from the requirements of this standard on the basis that the Company is included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group that include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is equivalent to FRS 29.
An amendment to FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which brings recognition and derecognition requirements of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement into FRS 26 became effective in 2007.
The amendment applies only to financial assets and liabilities.
The relevant requirements of FRS 5, Reporting the Substance of Transactions continue to apply to the recognition and derecognition of non-financial assets.
The adoption of this amendment to FRS 26 did not have an impact on the balance sheet or profit and loss account of the Company.
3 Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage interest rate and currency exposures.
The Companys policy is that amounts at risk through derivative transactions are covered by cash or by corresponding assets.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Under FRS 26, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity.
291 Notes on the parent company financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date in respect of the prior reporting period are treated as a non-adjusting event.
Where scrip dividends are issued, the value of such shares, measured as the amount of the cash dividend alternative, is credited to reserves and the amount in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued is transferred from the share premium account to retained profit.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups largest pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
Further details are disclosed in note 8.
The Company applies the requirements of FRS 17 as amended in December 2006 to its portion of PSPS surplus or deficit.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

8 Pension scheme financial position The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS which is primarily a closed defined benefit scheme.
At 31 December 2007, on the FRS 17, Retirement Benefits basis of valuation, PSPS accounted for 87 per cent 2006: 88 per cent of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
However, the individual accounts of the Company continue to follow UK GAAP.
In 2006, the Company early adopted the amendment to FRS 17 issued in December 2006 which aligned the FRS 17 disclosures with IAS 19.
At 31 December 2005, the allocation of surpluses and deficits attaching to PSPS between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the Prudential Assurance Companys PAC with-profits funds was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2007.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
Defined benefit schemes are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
PSPS was last actuarially valued as at 5 April 2005 using the projected unit method.
This valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 94 per cent funded, with a shortfall of actuarially determined assets to liabilities of six per cent, representing a deficit of 243 million.
The valuation as at 5 April 2005 was accompanied by changes to the basis of funding for the scheme from 2006 onwards.
Deficit funding amounts designed to eliminate the actuarial deficit over a 10-year period are being made.
Based on this valuation, total contributions to the scheme for deficit funding and employer contributions for ongoing service for current employees were expected to be of the order of 70 to 75 million per annum over a 10-year period.
In 2007, total contributions for the year, including expenses and augmentations, were 82 million 2006: 137 million.
The 2006 amount reflected the increased level of contributions for ongoing service and deficit funding backdated to 6 April 2005.
295 Notes on the parent company financial statements continued 8 Pension scheme financial position continued Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Partners, for the valuation of PSPS, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2007 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.
The key assumptions adopted were: 2007 % 2006 % Price inflation 3.3 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 5.3 5.0 Rate of increase in pension payments for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 3.3 3.0 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.9 5.2 Long-term expected rate of return Prospectively for 2008 % 2007 % 2006 % Equities 7.5 7.5 7.1 Bonds 5.5 4.9 4.5 Properties 6.75 6.8 6.4 Other assets 5.5 5.0 4.5 Weighted average long-term expected rate of return 6.2 5.9 6.1 The long-term expected rates of return have been determined after applying due consideration to the requirements of paragraph 54 of FRS 17, in particular, taking account of the values of the assets.
Further details on the PSPS scheme, including mortality assumptions, are shown in note I1 Staff and Pension Plans of the notes on the financial statements of the Group.
