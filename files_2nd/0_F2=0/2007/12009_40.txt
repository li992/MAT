TAXATION continued The Finance Bill 2007 contains provisions relating to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
It was also announced that industrial building allowances will be phased out over three years commencing 1 April 2008.
At 31 March 2007, the above changes were not substantively enacted.
If the change in corporation tax rate is fully enacted then the deferred tax liability would reduce by 21 million.
The provisions to abolish industrial building allowances are expected to be contained in the Finance Bill 2008 and if fully enacted, are likely to increase the deferred tax liability by an estimated 37 million.
The combined impact would therefore be to increase the deferred tax liability by 16 million.
