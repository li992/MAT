Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General information Britvic plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
It is a public limited company domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Britvic plc and its subsidiaries together the Group operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed within Note 32.
Statement of compliance The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including relevant International Accounting Standards IAS, Standing Interpretations Committee SIC and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation For all periods up to and including the year ended 2 October 2005, Britannia Soft Drinks Limited prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
As a consequence of the acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited by Britvic plc and of that companys listing on the London Stock Exchange, from 3 October 2005 the Group is required to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The prior year financial statements were therefore the first financial statements prepared by Britvic plc in accordance with IFRS.
As such the Group took the following exemptions available under IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: a Not to restate the comparative information disclosed in the 2005 Financial Statements being the Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2005 in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
b Not to restate business combinations occurring before 4 October 2004. c To recognise all actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other post-retirement benets directly in shareholders equity at 4 October 2004. d Not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to grants of equity instruments on or before 7 November 2002 that had vested prior to 1 January 2005.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial information of Britvic plc and the entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the accounts of Britvic plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 September 2007.
The acquisition method of accounting has been used, under which the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2007 45 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, and after deduction of sales-related discounts, value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Sales related discounts are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet claims by the Groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Plant and machinery 320 years Vehicles included in plant and machinery 57 years Equipment in retail outlets included in xtures, ttings, tools and equipment 510 years Other xtures and ttings included in xtures, ttings, tools and equipment 310 years Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and are included in the income statement.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill Business combinations on or after 4 October 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement and positive goodwill is recognised on the balance sheet.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the Group of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies by management.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the Group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either nite or indefinite.
Amortisation is charged on assets with nite lives on a straight-line basis over a period appropriate to the assets useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with nite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to nite is made on a prospective basis.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Software costs Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Goodwill impairment losses cannot subsequently be reversed.
Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial assets The Group determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial period-end.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group has financial assets that are classied as loans and receivables.
The Group measures these as follows: Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate uctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2007 47 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classied as: Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash ow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Fair value hedges For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged: the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to the income statement.
For hedged items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment is amortised through the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
When an unrecognised rm commitment is designated as a hedged item, this gives rise to an asset or liability in the balance sheet, representing the cumulative change in the fair value of the rm commitment attributable to the hedged risk.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Cash ow hedges For cash ow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
Net investment hedges Derivative financial instruments are classied as net investment hedges when they hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The Groups foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances.
Gains or losses on translation of borrowings are recognised in equity.
Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign operations cumulative gain or loss is recycled through the income statement.
Derecognition of financial instruments The derecognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all the cash ows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments continued The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Taxation The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the year, after any adjustments in respect of prior years.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benets, provisions for share-based payments and employee profit share schemes and other short-term temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Group operates a pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP, which has both a dened benefit fund and a dened contribution fund.
The dened benefit section of the BPP was closed on 1 August 2002, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join the dened contribution section of the BPP.
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of the soft drinks business of C&C Group Britvic Ireland on 29 August 2007, the Company inherited a further pension scheme in which its employees in Northern Ireland participate, the C&C Pension Trust 1973 Ltd. Also, following the acquisition the employees in the Republic of Ireland have continued to participate in a number of C&C Group pension funds until new arrangements are nalised in the 12 months following acquisition.
Under dened benefit pension plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities.
The service cost of providing pension benets to employees for the year is charged to the income statement.
The cost of making improvements to pensions is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period during which the increase in benets vests.
To the extent that the improvements in benets vest immediately, the cost is recognised immediately.
These costs are recognised as an expense.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benets already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the plan liabilities during the year is included within administrative expenses.
A credit representing the expected return on the plan assets during the year is included within administrative expenses.
This credit is based on the market value of the plan assets, and expected rates of return, at the beginning of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets: differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the year: or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
For dened contribution plans, contributions payable for the year are charged to the income statement as an operating expense.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2007 49 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Employee benets Wages, salaries, bonuses, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources embodying economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Leases Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignicant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash ows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful accounts.
An allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are stated at proceeds received less any unamortised issue costs.
Finance costs not settled in the period are included within the outstanding loan balance and finance charges are charged to the income statement using an effective interest rate method.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies continued Foreign operations The income statement and cash ows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period.
The balance sheet is translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date.
Opening net assets and exchange differences arising on the translation of results at an average rate compared to a closing rate are both dealt with through reserves.
On disposal of a foreign operation accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in equity are included in the profit or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Segment reporting reects the internal management structure and the way the business is managed.
Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Exceptional Items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those significant items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised as finance costs in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans The finance cost recognised in the income statement in respect of capital instruments is allocated to periods over the terms of the instrument using the effective interest method.
New standards and interpretations not applied The Group has not applied the following IFRSs and IFRIC Interpretations, which will be applicable to the Group, that have been issued but are not yet effective: Effective date, periods commencing International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources 1 January 2007 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 International Accounting Standards IAS IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements Revised 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1 January 2008 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2007 51 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied continued Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their signicance and the nature and extent of the risks that they give rise to.
More specically the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Those standards not mentioned above but issued recently have been considered by the Group and have no significant impact on the financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates and judgements in a number of areas.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing significant adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post retirement benets The determination of the pension and other post retirement benets cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, ination, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require managements judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, significant judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realised.
Provisional goodwill The acquisition of Britvic Ireland was completed on the 29 August 2007.
The fair value adjustments as presented in Note 15 of the financial statements reect managements current best estimates.
As permitted by IFRS 3 Business combinations, these items may be subject to further revision within a period of 12 months from the date of acquisition, in determining the final goodwill arising from the acquisition.
Cross currency interest rate swaps The Group measures cross currency interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash ows at the swap contract rate and the valuations rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present value, future foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Segmental reporting In prior periods the Directors have considered that the Group had only one reportable geographical segment and one business segment being the manufacture and sale of soft drinks.
Following the acquisition of Britvic Ireland during the year, the Directors now consider that the Groups primary reporting segment is geographical, as this is the basis on which the Group is organised and managed.
The geographical segments are: United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland GB and Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland ROI & NI.
Britvic International is included within the GB segment.

Incentive schemes directly associated with the otation include all-employee share schemes and management incentives.
The cost in 2007 relates to a transitional award granted to members of both the senior leadership team and senior management team shortly after otation, the purpose of which was to compensate these individuals for the loss of existing long-term incentive bonuses which were discontinued upon otation.
Restructuring costs includes the costs of major restructuring programmes undertaken in the year.
These include the outsourcing of both the secondary distribution network and the delivery and remanufacture of vending and chiller equipment to external providers.
These costs relate principally to redundancy costs and advisors fees.
Returnable bottle impairment relates to a write-down of inventories for returnable glass bottle stocks which have become redundant due to the move to non-returnable bottles in the GB segment.
profit on sale of property, plant and equipment relates to the sale of one of the Groups depots which was completed in April 2007.
The Group has entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with regard to this depot.
Further detail is provided in Note 31.
Acquisition costs for the purchase of Britvic Ireland relate to the costs incurred in acquiring the business which cannot be included in the cost of the business combination and therefore cannot be capitalised.
Principally these costs relate to setting up the nancing structure to facilitate the acquisition and internal staff costs such as transaction bonuses.
The pension curtailment gain is triggered by the transfer of Group employees under the outsourcing arrangements of the secondary distribution network.
Those employees that are members of the Britvic Pension Plan will no longer accrue future entitlement, which gives rise to the curtailment gain.
Further detail is provided in Note 25.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent before deducting interest on the convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Included in goodwill recognised are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the favourable market presence which Britvic Ireland enjoys and an assembled workforce.

The Britvic Ireland companies that have been acquired in this business combination had not previously been deemed a group and therefore had not produced consolidated financial information.
As such there are certain costs that are not easily identiable and it is therefore impracticable to state what the contribution to Group revenue and net profit would have been had the business combination completed on the first day of the financial period.

Goodwill impairment considerations Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated by senior management to seven individual cash-generating units for impairment testing as follows: Orchid: Red Devil: Tango: Robinsons: Britvic Soft Drinks business: Water Business: and Britvic Ireland.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to these units has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
To calculate this, 20-year cash ow projections are used based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period.
A 20-year cash ow period has been used to reect the considered longevity of the cash-generating units.
The post-tax discount rate applied to post-tax cash ow projections is 8% 2006: 8% and cash ows beyond the one-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate in line with senior management expectations of growth.
No growth in real terms is assumed beyond five years.

Growth rates reect senior management expectations of volume growth.
Discount rates reect senior managements estimate of the cost of capital.
The estimated cost of capital is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Budgeted marginal contribution financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to budgeted marginal contribution.
Advertising and promotional spend financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to advertising and promotional spend.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead ination the basis used to determine the value assigned to ination is forecast consumer price indices of 2.5%.

The funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups nances.
Contributions are paid into the funds in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2004, with a further valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 currently being nalised.
As a result of the latest formal valuation, further contributions of 30m, 30m and 10m were made in March 2005, December 2005 and December 2006 respectively.
An additional annual contribution of 10m will be made in December 2007-2010 in order to eliminate the funding deficit in the scheme arising at that time.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP dened contribution scheme in the income statement for 2007 was 1.4m 2006: 1.3m.
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of Britvic Ireland on 29 August 2007, the company inherited a further pension scheme in which its new employees in Northern Ireland participate, the C&C Pension Trust 1973 Ltd CCPT.
Also, following the acquisition the new employees in the Republic of Ireland ROI have continued to participate in a number of C&C Group pension funds C&C until new arrangements are nalised in the 12 months following acquisition.
Both CCPT and C&C pension schemes have a dened benefit section closed on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join the dened contribution section.
The latest valuation for both schemes for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2005.
A provisional valuation of these schemes at the acquisition date has been carried out by a qualied actuary based on information available.
Changes to this provisional valuation can be made up to twelve months after the acquisition date.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 30 September 2007 by a qualied actuary.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables known as PA92.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has been also included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2007 2007 2006 Years Years Years ROI GB GB Current pensioners at age 65 males 19.0 19.9 20.6 Current pensioners at age 65 females 21.9 22.8 23.6 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 20.5 21.1 22.5 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 23.4 24.0 25.3 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the pension obligation have been revised in 2007 following a mortality investigation carried out as part of the ongoing actuarial valuation of the Britvic Pension Plan at 31 March 2007.

The pension curtailment is triggered by the transfer of Group employees under the outsourcing arrangements of the secondary distribution network.
Those employees that are members of the BPP will no longer accrue future entitlement, which gives rise to the curtailment gain.

Financial instruments Overview The Groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Groups operations include trade receivables and payables see Notes 19 and 26 respectively.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations in euro-denominated countries.
Foreign exchange risk is primarily in respect of exposure to uctuations to the sterling-euro rate of exchange.
The Group nances foreign operations mainly through the use of foreign currency borrowings which hedge the net investment in foreign operations.
The Group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials and commercial assets in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities.
Such purchases are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
For the period ended 30 September 2007, the Group has hedged 70% 2006: 70% of forecast exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the Group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash ows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being PET, sugar, cans and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the Group enters into xed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both xed and oating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate prole and to manage the Groups exposure to interest uctuation.
At 30 September 2007, 222.9m 2006: 100.0m of the Groups borrowings were at xed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and exibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts.
The bank loans entered into by the Group are unsecured.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk prole of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate prole of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group by maturity date is as follows: Fixed rate 2007 Within More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total m m m m m m m Notes 222.9 222.9 2006 Within More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total m m m m m m m Bank loans 100.0 100.0 Includes the effects of the related oating to xed interest rate swaps on oating borrowings discussed below.
Floating rate 2007 Within More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total m m m m m m m Cash 27.3 27.3 Bank loans 13.1 194.9 208.0 Interest rate swap 3.4 3.4 Foreign currency contracts 0.2 0.2 2006 Within More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total m m m m m m m Cash 19.2 19.2 Bank loans 17.5 184.3 201.8 Interest rate swap 0.5 0.5 Foreign currency contracts 1.0 1.0 See Note 24.
Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classied as xed rate is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2007 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27.
Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial instruments, except trade and other receivables and payables.

The fair value of the current trade and other receivables and payables approximate their book value.
Hedges Cash ow hedges At 30 September 2007, the Group held 27 2006: 25 US dollar and 21 2006: 58 euro forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of expected future purchases from overseas suppliers in US dollars and euros for which the Group believe to be highly probable transactions.
The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these highly probable transactions.
The terms of these contracts are as follows: Average Maturity range exchange rate Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases 2007 US$10,128,000 31 Oct 07 29 Aug 08 US$2.00 EUR22,881,000 31 Oct 07 28 Apr 08 EUR1.46 2006 US$7,084,000 31 Oct 06 28 Sept 07 US$1.81 EUR43,548,000 31 Oct 06 28 Sept 07 EUR1.48 The terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
The cash ow hedges of the expected future purchases within the 12 months of the balance sheet date have been assessed to be effective.
In February 2007, Britvic plc issued US$375m and 38m of Senior Notes in the United States Private Placement market.
As a result of this transaction further cash ow hedges were entered into.
These are detailed in Note 24.
Other non-current liabilities 2007 2006 m m Deferred consideration 1.2 This amount relates to the element of additional deferred consideration due to the vendors of Red Devil payable after one year.
Further detail is given in Note 14.
Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 30 September 2007 is 8.1m 2006: 6.9m.
All of that expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four-week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the Company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the year are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
Number of shares 2007 2006 Annual free shares award 582,762 957,953 Matching shares award one free share for every ordinary share purchased 455,349 347,212 Special free shares award after otation 915,408 Special matching shares award two free shares for every ordinary share purchased 339,952 The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan ESOP The ESOP allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the market price of Britvic plcs shares on the business day before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three-year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 40% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the Company, an optionholder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 44.7p 2006: 40.4p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 30 September 2007.

Share-based payments continued The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares to be made to selected employees subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which measures the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group consisting of 20 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the Companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 40% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team will be subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three-year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 40% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In addition, a transitional award has been made to members of both the senior leadership team and the senior management team shortly after otation, at levels varying according to seniority.
These awards will vest in tranches over a period of up to three years, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
The performance condition requires the Companys Return on Invested Capital ROIC to be at least 17% over the performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 15% over the performance period, 50% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the Company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of shares during the year.

Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments In April 2007, the Group completed a sale and leaseback transaction with regard to its Tamworth depot.
The Group has entered into a short-term lease which has no significant arrangements of note.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2007 Land and buildings Other Total m m m Within one year 4.0 6.1 10.1 After one year but not more than five years 10.6 11.7 22.3 More than five years 35.3 1.9 37.2 49.9 19.7 69.6 2006 Land and buildings Other Total m m m Within one year 3.5 5.4 8.9 After one year but not more than five years 10.4 8.0 18.4 More than five years 36.8 2.0 38.8 50.7 15.4 66.1 The Group enters into sublease agreements in respect of some of its operating leases for property.
At the reporting date the Group had contracted with tenants for future minimum operating sublease receipts amounting to 1.9m 2006: 2.1m.
Capital commitments At 30 September 2007, the Group has commitments of 2.0m 2006: 3.9m relating to the acquisition of new plant and machinery.
Contingent liabilities The Group has the following contingent liabilities at 30 September 2007 and 1 October 2006: The Group has assigned its interest in certain leasehold properties to other tenants.
It remains liable for rentals due to the landlord for any defaults on the part of these tenants.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount or timing of rentals that may default.
However, the Directors do not expect that any potential default would result in a material claim against the Group.
