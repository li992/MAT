Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Publishing Goodwill Titles 000 000 Cost Opening balance 130,271 1,353,462 Acquisition of business note 29 3,102 10,341 Disposal of business note 30 534 114 Non-recurring adjustment - see note below 5,874 Exchange movements 3,045 9,925 At 31 December 2007 130,010 1,373,614 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2007 Carrying amount At 31 December 2007 130,010 1,373,614 At 31 December 2006 130,271 1,353,462 The non-recurring adjustment of 5,874,000 relates to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 28% in the 2007 Finance Act.
Deferred tax provided on the value of publishing titles in all acquisitions since 1 January 2005 has been offset by an equal and opposite entry in goodwill.
With the reduction in the deferred tax provision to 28%, IAS12 requires the tax adjustment to be flowed through the Income Statement.
This leaves an unmatched goodwill balance which was only created by the original deferred taxation provision and, in line with IFRS, must be written off against operating profit.
This non-recurring adjustment of 5,874,000 is offset by an equal and opposite deferred tax credit as shown in note 12.
The adjustment in no way reflects any reduction in the underlying value of the Groups trading assets.
The Sterling Euro exchange rate remained very static during 2006 and in 2007 until the last quarter when it dropped sharply to an exchange rate of 1.3571 at 31 December 2007.
The exchange movement above reflects the impact of this exchange rate on the valuation of goodwill and publishing titles at the balance sheet date.
1,985,000 of the 3,045,000 relates to the deferred tax adjustment, see note 25.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying value of goodwill and publishing titles by CGU is as follows: Goodwill Publishing Titles 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Newspaper and contract printing segment CGUs: Scotland Newspaper Division 52,857 53,530 198,516 188,175 North Newspaper Division 107 114 449,138 449,138 Northwest Newspaper Division 534 163,000 163,114 Midlands Newspaper Division 864 926 176,592 176,592 South Newspaper Division 132,549 132,549 Northern Ireland Newspaper Division 33,459 35,273 115,380 114,299 Republic of Ireland Newspaper Division 42,723 39,894 138,439 129,595 130,010 130,271 1,373,614 1,353,462 The Northeast and North Newspaper Divisions, which were shown separately in the 2006 accounts, have been combined purely for operational reasons.
86 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 15.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets continued The Group tests goodwill and publishing titles every six months for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on consistent forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following 20 years based on estimated growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
No residual value or perpetuity factor was assumed in the value of these calculations up to 31 December 2006.
The assumptions were amended in 2007 to incorporate a residual value.
Both the previous cash flow forecast model and the revised including a residual value confirmed there was no impairment at 31 December 2007.

No interest is charged on the trade receivables.
The Group has provided for estimated irrecoverable amounts in accordance with its accounting policy described in note 3.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality and then defines credit terms and limits on a by-customer basis.
These credit terms are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers or low value purchases, pre-payment for the goods is required under the Groups policy.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, that the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has not deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and so considers the amounts recoverable.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, payment plans are in place to further reduce the risk of default on the receivable.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 43.5 million 2006: 37.2 million which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group believes that the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any security over these balances.
The weighted average age of these receivables is 31 days 2006: 28 days.

Other Financial Assets and Liabilities continued In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the balance sheet date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 38,000 2006: 35,000 which have been placed in liquidation.
These amounts have been provided for in full.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables Impaired trade receivables are those that have been provided for under the Groups bad debt provisioning policy, as described in the accounting policy in note 3.
The ageing of impaired trade receivables is shown below.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents totalling 17,470,000 2006: 24,636,000 comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Trade and other payables 2007 2006 000 000 Current: Trade creditors and accruals 69,186 67,676 Other creditors 7,934 5,994 77,120 73,670 Non current: Trade and other creditors 2,094 431 Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 27 days 2006 - 20 days.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure all payables are paid within the agreed credit terms.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates their fair value.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 93 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 - continued 24.
Retirement Benefit Obligation Throughout 2007 the Group operated the Johnston Press Pension Plan JPPP, together with the following schemes: A defined contribution scheme for the Republic of Ireland, the Johnston Press Ireland Pension Scheme.
Through the acquisitions in the Republic of Ireland in the second half of 2005, the Group inherited three final salary schemes.
Two are industry wide schemes and the third is for a small number of employees in Limerick.
There are no additional financial implications to the Group if these schemes are terminated.
Consequently, the Groups obligations to these schemes is included in Long Term Provisions and the details shown below exclude these schemes.
The JPPP is in two parts, a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter is closed to new members.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit method.
The contributions are fixed annual amounts with the intention of eliminating the deficit within 10 years.
As the defined benefit section has been closed to new members for a considerable period the last active member is scheduled to retire in 38 years with, at current mortality assumptions, the last pension paid in 60 years.
On a discounted basis the duration of the pension liabilities is circa 20 years.
The financial information provided below relates to the defined benefit element of the JPPP.
The composition of the trustees of the JPPP is made up of an independent Chairman, a number of member nominated by ballot trustees and several Company appointed trustees.
The majority are nominated by members of the JPPP, both current and past employees.
The trustees appoint their own advisors and the administrators of the Plan.
Discussions take place with the Executive Directors of the Company to agree matters such as the contribution rates.
Over the past few years the trustees have reduced the risk exposure to UK equities from a level of 75% of the Plan to 60% at 31 December 2007.
The defined contribution schemes provide for employee contributions between 2-5% dependent on age, with higher contributions from the Group.
In addition, the Group bears the majority of the administration costs and also life cover.
There are also executive sections of the scheme with increased contribution rates from both the employee and employer.
The pension cost charged to the Income Statement was as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Defined benefit schemes 3,977 5,194 Defined contribution schemes and Irish schemes 6,515 5,778 10,492 10,972 Major assumptions: Valuation at Valuation at 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.8% 5.1% Expected return on scheme assets 6.9% 6.9% Expected rate of salary increases 4.1% 3.8% Future pension increases 3.1% 2.8% Life expectancy Male 18.1 years 18.1 years Female 21.0 years 21.0 years The valuation of the defined benefits funding position is dependent on a number of assumptions and is therefore sensitive to changes in the assumptions used.
The impact of variations in the key assumptions are detailed below: A change in the discount rate of 0.1% pa would change the value of liabilities by 2% or 7.6 million.
A change in the life expectancy by one year would change liabilities by around 3% or 12 million.

Deferred Tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances before offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 400,055 417,737 Deferred tax assets 4,735 18,563 395,320 399,174 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 25,747,000 2006 - 20,810,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

The Company has only one class of ordinary shares which has no right to fixed income.
All the preference shares carry the right, subject to the discretion of the Company to distribute profits, to a fixed dividend of 13.75% and rank in priority to the ordinary shares.
Given the discretionary nature of the dividend right, the preference shares are considered to be equity under IAS32.

Guarantees and Other Financial Commitments a Lease commitments The Group has entered into non-cancellable operating leases in respect of plant and machinery, the payments for which extend over a period of years.
In addition, the Group leases certain land and buildings on short-term and long-term operating leases.
The rents payable under property leases are subject to renegotiation at various intervals specified in the leases.
The Group pays insurance, maintenance and repairs of these properties.

A guarantee is in place with the Groups bankers and Private Placement Senior Note holders which requires a specific proportion of the Groups assets and profits to be held within the guarantor group of companies.
d Contingent liability In March 2004, HMRC issued a tax assessment for 86 million against one of the RIM Group companies Johnston Press acquired in 2002.
With interest the potential liability now exceeds 100 million.
The assessment relates to the sale of the RIM companies by United Business Media plc UBM in 1998.
At a Special Commissioners hearing in 2006, the Chairman ruled in favour of HMRC.
This decision was appealed to the High Court and in March 2007 the Judge upheld the decision of the Special Commissioner.
An appeal has been lodged with the Court of Appeal and this was heard at the end of February 2008.
The Group understands UBM remains confident of an eventual successful outcome and no provision has been made in these financial statements.
In the event of proven liability the Group holds a full tax indemnity from UBM.

Share-based Payments Equity-settled share option scheme Options over ordinary shares are granted under the Executives Share Option Scheme.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day prior to the date of grant.
The vesting period is 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average exercise price of 453p, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.4 years.
No options were granted in 2006 or 2007.
Previous grants were valued using the Black-Scholes model.
As far as the assumptions were concerned, expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 1 year.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1,459,000 and 1,495,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2007 and 2006 respectively.
Group Savings - Related Share Option Scheme The Company operates a Group savings-related share option scheme.
This has been approved by the Inland Revenue and is based on eligible employees being granted options and their agreeing to save weekly or monthly in a sharesave account with Halifax plc for a period of either 3, 5 or 7 years.
The right to exercise is at the discretion of the employee within six months following the end of the period of saving.
Share-based Payments continued Apart from the 909,177 options granted on 27 September 2007, the above options were issued to employees at a price equivalent to the average mid-market price for the 30 days prior to 6 September 1999, 4 September 2000, 3 September 2001, 30 August 2002, 29 August 2003, 27 August 2004, 2 September 2005, 1 September 2006 and 3 September 2007 respectively.
The 909,177 options granted on 27 September 2007 were granted at the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the invitation being sent to employees on 3 September 2007.
This follows the approval of the revised Sharesave Scheme at the Annual General Meeting in April 2007.
A discount of 20% to the average mid-market price was applied to the issues in 2002 and thereafter.

Financial Instruments a Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 28 and in the Group Reconciliation of Shareholders Equity.
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure formally twice each year and when considering any corporate transaction.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on the recommendations of the Board, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2006. b Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.

These risks include market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board and requirements of the bank loan and private placement funding agreements, which provide guidelines which must be operated within.
The Group does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Corporate Treasury function reports regularly to the Executive Directors and the Board.
e Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates refer to section f and interest rates refer to section g. The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: Currency swaps to manage the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated borrowings, namely the US Dollar denominated private placement senior notes: Borrowings in Euros to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the Groups net investment in its foreign operations: and Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
At a Group and company level, market risk exposures are assessed using sensitivity analyses.
104 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 35.
Financial Instruments continued There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures risk.
f Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is a party to a number of cross currency interest rate swaps at the year end and, during the year, a foreign currency forward contract, in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups overseas subsidiaries namely Euros and in US dollars in order to hedge the risks associated with the US dollar denominated senior loan notes.
There were no open foreign currency forward contracts at the year end 2006: none.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Euro Trade receivables 9,520 7,627 Cash and cash equivalents 4,168 3,946 Trade payables 1,114 777 Borrowings 126,446 115,509 US Dollar Borrowings 135,183 137,819 Foreign currency sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euros and US dollars rates.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 5% change in pounds sterling against the Euro and a 5% change in pounds Sterling against the US Dollar.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
All hedges are assumed to be 100% effective.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity where pounds sterling strengthens against the respective currency.
For a 5% weakening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there is an equal and opposite impact on profit or loss and other equity, and the balances below reverse signs.
Euro currency impact US Dollar currency impact 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Profit or loss 398 403 Other equity 5,981 4,642 Of the impact on other equity an increase of 6,021,000 2006: 4,684,000 relates to the retranslation of the Groups Euro denominated borrowings and so would never materialise as it is hedged by a non-financial asset.
The movement in the magnitude of the impact on profit or loss in 2006 and 2007 is not significant.
With regard to the magnitude of the impact on other equity, the increased impact is driven by the fair values of the Euro denominated interest rate swaps which were in the Groups favour but not to the same extent at the end of 2007 as at the end of 2006. g Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the parent company borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align interest rate views, defined risk appetite and the requirements of the funding agreements in place, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 105 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 - continued 35.
Financial Instruments continued outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: Net profit would increase by 1,702,000 2006: 1,582,000.
The increase in the current year is mainly due to the impact of the Groups fair value hedges: and Other equity reserves would decrease by 3,433,000 2006: 3,680,000 as a result of the changes in the fair value of the Groups cash flow hedges.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the turmoil in financial markets that led to significant differentials between LIBOR and base rates in the second half of the year.
For an increase of 50 bps, the numbers shown above would have the opposite sign.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued floating rate debt held.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
In the tables below, positive values in the fair value columns denote financial assets and negative values denote financial liabilities.
Cash flow hedges Outstanding receive floating Average contract Notional principal pay fixed contracts fixed interest amount Fair value 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 % % 000 000 000 000 Within 1 year 5.31 190,000 88 2 to 5 years 4.44 4.47 291,762 287,314 4,133 5,853 4.44 4.80 291,762 477,314 4,133 5,941 Contracts with nominal values of 70 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 3.09% for periods up to 2009, contracts with a nominal value of 100 million have fixed interest payments at an average of 4.59% for periods up to the beginning of 2011, contracts with a nominal value of 100 million with fixed interest payments at an average of 4.49% for the period to 2010 and contracts with a nominal value of $75 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 5.72% for the period to 2016.
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis with interest being paid weekly monthly on the underlying principal amount.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 months LIBOR for the Sterling denominated principal amounts and 3 months EURIBOR for the Euro denominated principal amounts.
The Group settles the difference between the fixed and floating interest rates on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest rate amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.

Financial Instruments continued The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly six-monthly basis.
The average floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 month LIBOR 1.37% and 6 month LIBOR 0.71%.
h Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in notes 3 and 21.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored.
As far as possible, the aggregate value of transactions is spread across a number of approved counterparties.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics, the latter being defined as connected entities, other than with some of the larger advertising agencies.
In the case of the latter, a close relationship exists between the Group and the agencies and appropriate allowances for doubtful debts are in place.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The following table shows the total exposure to credit risk for all of the Groups financial assets, excluding trade receivables which are discussed in note 21: 2007 2006 Carrying Exposure to Carrying Exposure to value credit risk value credit risk 000 000 000 000 Available for sale investments 2,712 2,712 Cash and cash equivalents 17,470 24,636 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 4,192 6,598 24,374 33,946 i Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
