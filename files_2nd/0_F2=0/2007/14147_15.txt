annual report 2007 notes to the financial statements.
1 Accounting policies Group and Company a General information Shanks Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. b Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as required by Article 4 of the European Union IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, which are stated at fair value.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied.
During the year, the Group has early adopted IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements for its Private Finance Initiative PFI contracts.
Previously, the Group applied the principles of the relating draft interpretations D12-14.
Accordingly, the adoption of IFRIC 12 has had no impact on the financial statements.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2006.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: disclosures was issued in August 2005 and is required to be implemented from 1 April 2007.
This new standard supersedes IAS 32 and incorporates its disclosure requirements as well as requiring further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in relations to financial instruments.
Other than IFRS 7, accounting standards and interpretations in issue at the date of approval of these financial statements but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The most significant judgements made relate to assumptions concerning discount rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates in connection with the Groups retirement benefit obligations see note 22.
In making these assumptions, the Group takes advice from qualified actuaries.
Other significant judgements made relate to provisions see notes 1 p and q and PFI contracts see note 1 d. c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements by proportional consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
Wholly owned subsidiary companies set up under PFI contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
d PFI contracts The Groups PFI contracts are all Integrated Waste Management contracts.
In these contracts, the existing Local Authority waste management operations are operated by the Group from inception of the contract.
The PFI contract requires the building of new infrastructure to add to that inherited from the previous service provider and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the contract.
The payments made to contractors for the construction of the infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets.
The Group accounts for the service element as revenue and the repayment element is deducted from the financial asset.
Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in the contract payments from the Local Authority.
Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract life.
Borrowing costs relating to contract specific external borrowings are expensed in the income statement.
Bid costs are expensed in the income statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability that a contract will be awarded.
Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised.
When the contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset.
e Revenue Revenue represents the invoiced value of waste streams processed and other services provided including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised when processing occurs or when the service is provided.
continued 1 Accounting policies continued f Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 April 2005.
The fair value of options granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Adjustments to the amounts expensed are only made in respect of nonmarket related factors.
g Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
h Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiaries and businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Capitalised goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS 31 March 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business is calculated after taking into account any goodwill excluding amounts previously written off to reserves prior to 1998. ii Landfill void When landfill operations are acquired, landfill void is capitalised based on the fair value of the asset acquired and is amortised over the operational life based on the amount of void space consumed.
iii Other intangibles Other acquired intangible assets are capitalised based on the fair value of the assets acquired or the costs incurred to purchase and bring the assets into use.
These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: Computer software 1 to 3 years Waste permits 5 to 20 years Other 5 to 10 years i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for any impairment, except for freehold land which is not depreciated.
i Buildings, plant and machinery: Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and machinery lives are: Computer equipment 1 to 3 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years ii Landfill sites: Site development costs including engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
annual report 2007 1 Accounting policies continued j Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
k Impairment of assets and investments Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation and investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an operating expense.
l Leased assets i Finance leases: Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in creditors.
Depreciation is provided to write off the assets over the expected useful life.
ii Operating leases: All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 27 to the accounts.
m Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis.
n Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to the income statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
o Unprocessed waste The accrual or deferred income relating to unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value or processing cost.
p Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the net present value NPV of the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landfill sites and this value is capitalised.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
q Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at its landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the income statement and not charged to the provision.
r Discounting All long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
s Retirement benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under the amended IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value.
The operating and financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the income statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they become due.
The Group participates in several multi-employer schemes in the Netherlands.
These are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
continued 1 Accounting policies continued t Tax i Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through the statement of recognised income and expense or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there.
u Foreign currencies Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Groups exchange reserve.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary undertaking is disposed of.
The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations.
Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the income statement in the period the ineffectiveness arises.
v Financial instruments i Trade receivables and other receivables Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
ii Financial assets relating to PFI contracts Financial assets relating to PFI contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
iv External borrowings Interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v Trade payables and other payables Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi Derivative financial instruments As part of the Groups PFI contracts, the Group has a number of interest rate swaps.
These swaps are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the gains or losses between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income statement.
w Dividends Dividends are accounted for in the period in which they are paid or received.
annual report 2007 1 Accounting policies continued x Segment reporting The Group operates in one business, waste management, and is divided by geography for management reporting and control.
Components that make up the primary segmental analysis provided in the financial statements are the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Central Services.
No secondary segmental analysis is provided as the primary segmental analysis follows the geographical split.
2 Financial risk management objectives and policies a Risk The Group is exposed to a number of financial risks, of which the most significant are set out below.
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in Europe and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements in the Euro and Sterling.
Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations.
This exposure is managed primarily through Euro denominated borrowings.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings see note 1 u.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups cash flow interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings issued at variable rates to finance PFI contracts.
In order to reduce funding risk and maintain interest cover, the Group manages the risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps over the period of the borrowing.
Under the swaps, the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals mainly semiannually, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts, calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amount.
Whilst the interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows and hedge accounting under IAS 39 would allow changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps to be recognised directly in reserves, the Group believes that it is not worth expending significant resources fulfilling the onerous documentation requirements of IAS 39.
The interest rate swaps are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39 see accounting policy in note 1 v. The swaps are presented in non-current liabilities together with the related long term borrowings since the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk through the fixed interest rate on the Groups senior notes and the fixed interest rate on finance leases.
Credit risk The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
b Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the swap position at the year end.
The fair value of fixed interest liabilities is measured by reference to the present value of their future interest payments against equivalent current market rates.

On 1 January 2007 the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands decreased from 29.6% to 25.5%.
As a consequence, deferred tax in the Netherlands has been calculated using the revised rate, which has resulted in a credit to the income statement of approximately 1.5m.

Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement because of their size or incidence.
Changes in fair values of interest rate swaps that the Group is required to enter into in relation to its PFI arrangements are excluded as they do not reflect commercial reality.
Goodwill impairment Impairment testing is carried out at segment level on an annual basis.
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill using projected cashflows for the next twenty years discounted at the Groups estimated average cost of capital 9% after tax.
The cash flows are based on projections prepared by management covering a five-year period and include no growth assumptions after the end of the current five-year plan.
The projections also assume that the current five-year plan is achieved.
The calculations use effective tax rates specific to each separate segment.
Other intangible assets impairment During the year there has been no indication of any impairment.
Accordingly, no impairment review has been carried out.

annual report 2007 14 Business combinations a On 30 June 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Smink Beheer B. V. a waste management company in the Netherlands, for a total consideration of 60.8m.
The goodwill recognised is attributable to Sminks strong position and profitability and the significant synergies expected to arise post acquisition.
From acquisition to 31 March 2007, Smink Beheer B. V. has contributed 27.0m to revenue and 2.0m to profit after tax.
The aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities acquired and the provisional fair value to the Group, pending completion of the evaluation of the business, were as follows: Fair Provisional Book value fair value adjustment value m m m Intangible assets 1.8 24.9 26.7 Property, plant and equipment 9.6 3.3 12.9 Other non-current receivables 1.5 1.5 Inventories 0.1 0.1 Trade receivables 6.0 6.0 Other current receivables 0.4 0.4 Cash 16.7 16.7 Trade payables 2.1 2.1 Other current payables 3.8 3.8 Current tax payable 5.5 3.3 2.2 Deferred tax liabilities 1.1 9.9 11.0 Provisions 5.3 1.5 6.8 16.8 21.6 38.4 Provisional goodwill 22.4 60.8 Satisfied by: Cash consideration 59.0 Deferred consideration 1.5 Costs incurred 0.3 Total consideration 60.8 b During the period the Group completed the acquisition of other tuck-in businesses.
The goodwill recognised is attributable to synergy benefits through the amalgamation of the acquired businesses with existing businesses.
From acquisition to 31 March 2007, the businesses contributed 10.0m to revenue and 0.1m to profit after tax.
The aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities acquired and the provisional fair value to the Group, pending completion of the evaluation of the businesses, were as follows: Fair Provisional Book value fair value adjustment value m m m Intangible assets 1.1 1.1 Property, plant and equipment 8.6 4.4 13.0 Other current liabilities 0.1 0.1 Borrowings 0.5 0.5 Deferred tax liabilities 0.4 0.4 8.0 5.1 13.1 Provisional goodwill 9.1 22.2 Satisfied by: Cash consideration 21.8 Costs incurred 0.4 Total consideration 22.2 57 shanks.
continued 14 Business combinations continued c If all of the acquisitions had been completed on 1 April 2006 instead of the dates above, total Group revenue and Group profit for the year would have been approximately 520.7m and 32.4m respectively on a pro-forma basis.
The pro-forma amounts include the results of the acquired companies from the date of acquisition together with pre-acquisition results from 1 April 2006 to the acquisition date as adjusted for the effect of significant fair value adjustments.
The pro-forma information is provided for comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined businesses.
15 Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences under the liability method using applicable local tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 11.8m 2006: 6.3m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 8.6m 2006: 4.2m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.
As a result of changes announced in the United Kingdom budget, which are expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2007, the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 30% to 28%, which is expected to reduce deferred tax assets by approximately 0.6m in the year ending 31 March 2008.
There will also be phased withdrawal of industrial buildings allowance which is expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2008.
As the rules on how this will be implemented are unclear the impact cannot be quantified, however it may have a material adverse effect on the tax charge in the year ending 31 March 2009.

As a result of changes announced in the United Kingdom budget, which are expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2007, the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 30% to 28%.

The Group also has two other small funded defined benefit schemes, which are included in the defined benefit disclosures below.
Pension costs for the defined benefit section are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Assumptions The most recent actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group dated 5 April 2006 have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2007.
The main assumptions were as follows: 2007 2006 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.4 4.9 Future salary growth 4.7 4.5 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 5% 3.2 2.9 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 2.5% 2.4 Rate of price inflation 3.2 3.0 Mortality rates used are based on the 00 series of actuarial tables adjusted for Medium Cohort and assume an improvement in life expectancy of 1% per annum for males and 0.5% per annum for females.
The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes.
The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees in the Netherlands and Belgium.
