The differences are explained below: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Profit before tax 273 313 238 Profit before tax multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30%, 2005: 30% 82 94 71 Effects of: Non-tax deductible amortisation and impairment of intangibles 5 5 4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 12 2 4 Non-taxable investment disposals and impairments 6 15 13 Adjustments in respect of prior years 11 56 23 Recognition of tax losses that arose in prior years 4 33 Effects of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes 8 Other differences 30 6 1 Total taxation for continuing operations 60 20 9 Other differences are primarily due to overseas profits taxed at rates different to those in the UK, and the geographical mix of profits in the Group.
On 12 March 2007, the UK Government announced that the standard rate of corporation tax will be reduced to 28% for profits arising after 31 March 2008.
As a result of this change of rate, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities of the group have been remeasured to reflect the expected realisable value of those assets and liabilities at the reduced rate of tax.
The tax charge for the year includes a charge of 20 million in respect of UK tax 2006: credit of 34 million: 2005: charge of 16 million, of which 6 million relates to the effect on deferred taxes of the announced reduction in UK tax rate.

The Group has no activities which are required to be classified as discontinued operations during 2007.
However, additional gains totalling 14 million 2006: 12 million have been recognised in 2007.
10 million 2006: 12 million relates to the disposal of Instinet Group, which was classified as a discontinued operation during 2005 and a further 4 million relating to associated costs of the disposal of Radianz.
The gains relate to tax settlements and the release of tax provisions no longer required.

Discontinued operations in 2005 Subsidiaries acquired with a view to resale: Radianz On 21 October 2004, Reuters entered into exclusive discussions with BT to secure a long-term agreement for the provision of network services, including the sale of Radianz to BT.
As a prerequisite to this agreement, Reuters acquired Equants 49% voting interest in Radianz, with a view to selling the 100% interest to BT.
On 29 April 2005, Reuters completed the sale of its 100% voting interest in Radianz to BT for gross proceeds of 115 million.
The disposal of Radianz in 2005 resulted in a loss on disposal of 4 million, which is presented within profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries within discontinued operations.
Disposal of subsidiaries: Instinet Group including BTC Reuters held approximately 62% of the shares in Instinet Group, a US based company, which was previously accounted for as a subsidiary of Reuters Group PLC on a 100% consolidated basis with offsetting minority interest.
On 31 March 2005, Reuters sold BTC, a soft dollar execution broker, to Instinet Group, for approximately 3.8 million shares of Instinet Group stock, valued at approximately 12 million.
In 2004, an impairment loss of 17 million was recognised for BTC within profit for the year from discontinued operations.
The sale to Instinet Group has been accounted for as a partial disposal of the Groups interest in BTC, which resulted in a loss of 3 million.
BTC made profits after tax of 1 million in the period prior to sale.
On 8 December 2005, Reuters disposed of its investment in Instinet Group for gross proceeds of 612 million including 37 million relating to Reuters share of an Instinet Group dividend received prior to close.
Reuters recorded a net gain on sale of 191 million in 2005 within profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries within discontinued operations.
Instinet Groups results up until sale, a profit after taxation of 68 million before minority interest, are also included in the Group results as part of discontinued operations.

Fair value adjustments are based on an independent valuation performed by  valuers.
Reclassifications in 2005 relate to Instinet Group, which was classified as a discontinued operation prior to its disposal.
Expenditure related to the development of new products or capabilities that is incurred between establishing technical feasibility and the asset becoming ready for use is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in IAS38 Intangible assets.
Such assets are then systematically amortised over their useful economic life.
Additionally, the costs of acquiring software licences and costs incurred in bringing software into use are capitalised, and amortised over the expected life of the licence.
There is judgement involved in determining an appropriate framework to consider which expenditure requires capitalisation and which should be expensed.
The carrying amount of intangibles, other than goodwill, internally-generated software and purchased software, at 31 December includes the following balances which are considered to be material to the Groups financial statements: Arising on acquisition of Nature included in category Date of acquisition Carrying amount m Remaining amortisation period Telerate Customer relationships June 2005 35 7 years, 5 months Application Networks Technology know-how June 2006 10 3 years, 5 months Reuters Group PLC Annual Report 2007 54330 pp060-105.

For the purpose of performing impairment reviews, Reuters has identified seven cash generating units CGUs.
In prior years, Reuters identified eight CGUs, but disposed of Bridge Trading Company BTC in 2005.
Annual impairment reviews are performed as at 1 July for all CGUs, which include goodwill.
These reviews compare the carrying value of each CGU with the present value of future cash flows arising from the use of the assets of the unit value in use.
If the value in use is less than the carrying value of the CGU, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.

They reflect managements expectations of revenue growth, operating cost and margin for each CGU based on past experience.
Projections exclude the expected revenue and cost synergy benefits arising from the various Core Plus growth strategies not yet underway.
Cash flows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2006: 9% to 11%, 2005: 9% has been applied to cash flow projections reflecting managements view that similar risk profiles exist for each CGU.
For accounting purposes, impairment testing has been performed using perpetuity growth rate of 3% 2006: 2% to 3%, 2005: 0% to 3%.
The rate used has been determined with regard to projected growth for the specific markets in which the CGUs participate.
This rate is below the long-term average growth rate for the businesses in which Reuters operates.
The forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the first three years of the forecast period.
However, there is significant headroom and forecast revenues would have to be more than 11% lower than currently projected, before a possible impairment charge would be indicated.
Impairment tests of other intangible assets Intangible asset impairment losses in the year of 21 million include 18 million in respect of Bridge trade names and technology know-how and 3 million in respect of internally generated and purchased software.
Declining use of the Bridge name in Reuters marketing and Reuters investment in new infrastructure have led management to consider that cash flows generated by the continuing use of these assets no longer support the carrying values of Bridge trade names and technology know-how.
The assets were held in Sales & Trading.
3 million of internally generated and purchased software assets have been impaired following management review.
Cash inflows forecast to be generated from these assets are not expected to be sufficient to support their carrying values.
These assets were held in Sales & Trading and Enterprise.

Reclassifications in 2007 relate to the Groups investment in TIMES NOW, which was classified as a non-current asset held for sale, and Pluck which was classified as an available-for-sale asset.
The Group holds a 51% interest in AFE Solutions Limited, a 35% holding in 3 Times Square Associates LLC and a 40% holding in Independent Research Network LLC, being other jointly controlled entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
In July 2006, Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced the formation of a new joint venture, FXMarketSpace Limited, to create a centrally-cleared, global foreign exchange trading system.
Reuters invested 8 million in the joint venture during 2006 and a further 10 million in 2007.
The Group holds a 50% interest in this jointly controlled entity.
In October 2006, Reuters acquired a 26% interest in Times Global Broadcasting Company Limited for 11 million relating to the launch of a new Indian TV News Channel, TIMES NOW, in association with the Times of India.
Reuters invested 5 million in the associate during 2007.
In November 2007 the TIMES NOW investment was classified as a non-current asset held for sale.
In November 2006, Reuters acquired a 17% interest in Pluck Corporation for 4 million.
This was classified as an associate and accounted for under the equity method of accounting because Reuters had an option to acquire 100% of the equity and therefore had significant influence over Pluck Corporation.
On 31 March 2007 this investment was transferred to available-for-sale assets following expiry of the option to purchase and was sold on 4 March 2008.
On 18 October 2006, Reuters agreed to sell the majority of its investment in Factiva to joint venture partner Dow Jones.
In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, Reuters reclassified its investment as a non-current asset held for sale on this date.
The sale was completed on 15 December 2006.

The Group is committed to managing its capital structure with the objective of maintaining the right balance between funding investment opportunities, managing the risk profile of the business and returning surplus cash to shareholders.
On 1 March 2007 Reuters communicated that it will actively manage its capital structure to maintain a strong investment grade rating of BBB Baa1.
Prior to that Reuters had maintained a credit rating of AA3 or better.
Reuters monitors the capital structure of the company on the basis of the primary debt capacity ratios as defined by our credit rating agencies.
The ratios are calculated using an adjusted cash flow measure as a percentage of adjusted net debt.
The adjustments take into account items such as pensions and operating leases.
The final credit rating is determined as a combination of financial and non-financial criteria, the ratio being just one of those financial criteria.

Provision for doubtful debts The allowance for doubtful debts is comprised entirely of impairments raised against specific trade receivables balances, which are mainly those greater than 365 days old.
Impairments represent the differences between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
No individual impairment is considered material.
The recognition of provisions, both in terms of timing and quantum, requires the exercise of judgement based on the relevant circumstances, which can be subject to change over time.
All debts greater than three months past their due date are reviewed monthly, and impairments raised where appropriate.
Examples of events which could give rise to impairment are: news about a customers financial condition, an account managers doubt that a customer is able to pay, delinquency in payment more than 365 days overdue and known trading or liquidity problems in a particular market sector.
If the final outcome on the judgement areas were to differ by 10% from managements estimates, the Group would need to book an adjustment of 1 million to operating costs and to trade receivables.

Following discussions with Trustees of the RPF and SPS, a special contribution of 3.5 million was made to the SPS in 2007, with 36.2 million due to the RPF in 2008.
In addition, payments of 1.5 million per year are due to the SPS in each of the years from 2008 until 2010.
In addition to these special contributions, employers contribution rates have been agreed at between 19.0% and 25.8% of pensionable salary including 6% and 9% respectively through salary sacrifice arrangements from 1 April 2007 for RPF members and 34.2% for SPS members including 6% through salary sacrifice arrangements.

A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would result in a 53 million increase in the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The effects of such a change are partially hedged by the schemes asset portfolio.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the investments currently held to provide for the pension benefit obligations as at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets primarily consist of equity instruments and fixed income investments.
The expected rate of return on equities was based on expected market conditions in each of the territories in which plans operate.
The expected return on assets is stated net of investment expenses.
The expected return on assets for the UK plans at 31 December 2007, 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 is stated gross of the expected levy to the UK Pension Protection Fund.
UK mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation for the RPF and the SPS, the largest plans, at 31 December 2007 are based on the 00 series tables issued by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau with allowance for projected longevity improvements and adjustment for the medium cohort effect.
At 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 the 92 series short cohort tables were used, also with allowance for projected longevity improvements to calendar year 2025 and adjustment for the short cohort effect.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member reaching age 65 at the balance sheet date and member reaching 65 at the same date plus 25 years under the assumptions used at 31 December 2007, and under those used at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005.

Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 121 million carried forward at the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of these losses is 45 million.
Deferred tax assets of 185 million have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences arising in certain jurisdictions where losses were incurred in the current or preceding period.
Recognition of these assets is based on all relevant factors including their expected recovery measured using Group profit forecasts.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted, tax of 978 million would be payable.
