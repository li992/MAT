56 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements 1.
General information Premier Foods plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office and principal place of business is identified on page 26.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group, is the supply of branded and own label food and beverage products, as described in note 16.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 3 March 2008.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Premier Foods plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as endorsed by the European Union EU, International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC interpretations, and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and on the historical cost basis with the exception of derivative financial instruments, defined pension schemes, and share based payments, that are incorporated using fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the complimentary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Group or Companys financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
New standards and interpretations not applied.
During the year ended 31 December 2007, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after: International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 8 Operating segments 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1 January 2008 IFRICs 12, 13 and 14 are not endorsed by the EU.
These standards will be adopted by the Group in future accounting periods.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group's financial statements except for segmental analysis.
Although, the Group is not required to adopt IFRS 8: Operating Segments until the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2009, the Group proposes to align its reportable segments next year into those components that best represent those segments about which separate financial information is available and which are evaluated by the board in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
To this end the expected segments next year will be Grocery, Chilled & Ireland, and Bread & Milling.
Certain of these standards and interpretations will require additional disclosures over and above those currently included in these financial statements in the period of initial application.
57 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 2.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Premier Foods plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used for all acquisitions.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where the Group completes its fair value exercise in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations IFRS 3 in the year following acquisition, comparatives are restated for the final fair value adjustments, while comparatives are also restated to reclassify disposed businesses into discontinued operations.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
All inter-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.3 Turnover Turnover comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable to turnover and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Turnover is recognised when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Turnover is recognised on the following basis: i Sale of goods Sales of goods are recognised as turnover on transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, which generally coincides with the time when the merchandise is delivered to customers and title passes.
ii Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable.
iii Sales rebates and discounts Sales rebates and discount reserves are established based on management's best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet claims by the Group's customers in respect of these rebates and discounts.
The provision is made at the time of sale and released, if unutilised, after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made has become remote.
2.4 Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those segments operating in other economic environments.
Income and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated based on levels of senior management activity on the basis that this closely reflects the use of the Groups resources.
2.5 Share Based payments The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using an option-pricing model.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share Based Payment IFRS 2, the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
The amount of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
2.6 Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling, the Groups presentational currency, at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
The results of overseas subsidiaries with functional currencies other than in sterling are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling in the year.
Exchange differences arising from retranslation at year end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recorded in reserves as a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold exchange differences previously taken to equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
All other exchange gains or losses are recorded in the income statement.
58 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.7 Property, plant and equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost.
Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value of the asset when it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will transfer to the Group.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period it is incurred.
Differences between the cost of each item of PPE and its residual value are written off over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method.
Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual values of individual productive assets are performed annually, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The useful lives of owned assets range from 20 to 50 years for buildings, and 3 to 35 years for vehicles, plant and equipment.
All items of PPE are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
PPE is stated at cost less depreciation after taking into account the assets useful economic life.
2.8 Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for a business exceeds the fair value of the aggregate of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Items of PPE acquired as part of a business acquisition are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition using a market value or depreciated replacement cost model.
On acquisition, the Group undertakes a review of the accounting policies of the business acquired to ensure compliance both with IFRSs and the accounting policies of the Group.
2.9 Intangible assets In addition to goodwill the Group recognises the following intangible assets: Acquired intangibles Acquired trademarks, brands, customer relationships, licences, recipes and similar assets that are controlled through custody or legal rights and that could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured.
A reputable independent specialist performs the valuations.
All of these assets are considered to have finite lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives that range from 7 to 40 years.
Research and development Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Costs incurred in developing a product, typically its recipe or packaging, are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred unless the future economic benefits of the project can be regarded as reasonably assured and are in accordance with International Accounting Standard 38, Intangible Assets IAS 38, in which case they are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Software development costs Assets acquired or internally developed, such as software, are capitalised when the future economic benefit is reasonably assured and the criteria within IAS 38 are met.
Software development costs are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 10 years.
2.10 Impairment The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined, based on a review of a combination of factors including the asset ownership rights acquired and the nature of the overall product life cycle.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are also tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised, in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets in accordance with International Accounting Standard 36, Impairment of Assets IAS 36.
Intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing on indication of impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately.
2.11 Interest Borrowing costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method.
59 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 2.12 Leases Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group, are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the minimum lease payments or fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included under borrowings.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
2.13 Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
No interest is included but, where appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable overhead expenses as described in International Accounting Standard 2, Inventories IAS 2.
Cost is calculated on a first-in-first-out basis by reference to the invoiced value of supplies and attributable costs of bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling price is lower than cost.
2.14 Taxation The charge or credit for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit.
Deferred taxation is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than in a business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.15 Employee benefits Group companies provide a number of long-term employee benefit arrangements, primarily through pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds determined by periodic independent actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, which then invests the contributions to buy annuities for the pension liabilities as they become due based on the value of the fund, hence the Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.
Defined benefit plans The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
Defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of recognised income and expense in the year in which they arise.
Current service costs, past-service costs, administration costs, expected return on assets and interest costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
60 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
2.16 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Where material, the Group discounts its provisions.
2.17 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
When an outflow becomes probable, it is recognised as a provision.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
When inflow is virtually certain an asset is recognised.
2.18 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision is made for impairment when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
The rights and obligations relating to those trade receivables that have been sold to third parties are fide-recognised from the balance sheet where the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to have transferred.
Cash received from third parties in exchange for the transfer of ownership is recorded with cash and cash equivalents with the cost of financing prior to settlement by the customer recorded as interest on an accruals basis.
Amounts received from customers for receivables in respect of which title has transferred represent amounts owed to the transferee and are recorded as short term borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, with original maturities at inception of less than 90 days, comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash in hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and inclusive of debt issuance costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for borrowing costs.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables and other liabilities are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
61 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Derivative financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Movements in fair value of foreign exchange derivatives are recognised within other operating income and expense and those relating to interest swaps are recorded in interest payable and other financial charges or interest receivable and other financial income.
Net investment hedge Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within other operating income and expenditure.
2.19 Investment in own shares Investments in own shares are shown as a deduction in shareholders funds.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The following are areas of particular significance to the Groups financial statements and include the application of judgment, which is fundamental to the compilation of a set of financial statements.
3.1 Pensions The present value of the Group's pension obligations depends on a number of actuarial assumptions.
The primary assumptions used include the expected long-term rate of return on invested funds, the discount rate applicable to scheme liabilities, the long-term rate of inflation and estimates of the mortality applicable to scheme members.
At each reporting date, and on a continuous basis, the Group reviews the macro-economic and company specific factors influencing each of these assumptions, using professional advice, in order to record the Group's ongoing commitment and obligation to defined benefit schemes in accordance with IFRS.
One such assumption is the assumption of mortality rates and how these are expected to change in the future.
If the Groups assumption on the mortality of its members was amended to assume an increase of a further one year improvement in mortality, total liabilities would increase by 3.5%.
The Group is aware of, and alert to, the need to inform the Pensions Regulator to the extent that the Group is involved in any corporate activity that affects the rights of pension scheme members and the carrying value of the pension schemes.
Each of the underlying assumptions is set out in more detail in note 24.
3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill are performed annually unless an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary.
Impairment reviews in respect of intangible assets are performed when an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary.
Examples of such triggering events include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology, expectations of future operating losses, or a significant reduction in cash flows.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units CGUs are determined based on the higher of realisable value and valuein-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates.
The Group has considered the impact of the assumptions used on the calculations and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of the CGUs carrying values.
See note 14 for further details.
Acquired trademarks, brands, customer relationships, recipes and similar assets are considered to have finite lives that range from 7 to 40 years.
The determination of the useful lives takes into account certain quantitative factors such as sales expectations and growth prospects, and also many qualitative factors such as history and heritage, and market positioning, hence the determination of useful lives are subject to estimates and judgment.
For further detail see note 15.
3.3 Advertising and promotion costs Trade spend and promotional activity is dependent on market conditions and negotiations with customers.
Trade spend is charged to the income statement according to the substance of the agreements with customers and the terms of any contractual relationship.
Promotional support is generally charged to the income statement at the time of the relevant promotion.
These costs may be accrued on best estimates.
The actual costs may not be known until subsequent years when negotiations with customers are concluded.
Such adjustments are recognised in the year when final agreement is reached.
Expenditure on advertising is charged to the income statement when incurred, except where a particular campaign is used more than once.
In this case it is charged in line with the airtime profile.
3.4 Exceptional items Exceptional items are not explicitly addressed under IFRS.
Accordingly, the Group has defined exceptional items as those items of financial significance to be disclosed separately in order to assist in understanding the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Each of these items relate to events or circumstances that are nonrecurring in nature, such as a major restructuring, disposal of a business or asset, or integration of an acquisition.
62 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 3.5 Securitisation During the year, the Group sold the rights and obligations relating to certain of its trade receivable balances under a receivables purchasing agreement in order to achieve an overall lower cost of funding and permanently accelerate the generation of cash from working capital.
Accounting for a sale of this nature is judgmental and dependent on evidence of the substantive transfer of risk and reward from the Group to a third party.
In this instance, transference of the two primary risks, those of late payment and credit default was achieved at the balance sheet date.
The Group anticipates that the receivables purchasing agreement will remain in place over the medium term and that fide-recognition of the receivables subject to it will continue to be achieved, dependent upon ongoing review of the assessment of risk and reward transfer.
Segmental analysis The results below for the year ended 31 December 2007 are divided into the following continuing segments for the year.
Results for the Frozen business, MBMG and Erin Foods Limited disposed of in 2007 are presented as discontinued operations in both the current year and the comparative results for the year ended 31 December 2006 where appropriate.
The Group is not required to adopt IFRS 8: Operating Segments until the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2009.
However, in anticipation of adoption, the Group proposes to align its reportable segments next year into those components that best represent those segments about which separate financial information is available and which are evaluated by the board in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The segment previously titled Grocery has been changed to Core Premier for these financial statements.
This is a change to the name only and does not affect the numerical disclosures.
Each of these segments primarily supplies the United Kingdom market, although the Group also supplies certain products to other parts of Europe and also the United States.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the same terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The segment results for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006 are as follows: As a consequence of the extensive integration of the business, certain operating costs have been incurred centrally.
These costs have been allocated between the Groups operating segments and are reflected in the analysis below.

Exceptional items During the year, the Group embarked on an unprecedented investment programme in order to capture the cost and operational synergies available to the enlarged group.
As planned, and in combination with the pre-existing programme of integration for the Campbells business established in the prior year, this programme is the primary factor behind total non-recurring exceptional costs of 158.7m in the year 2006: 19.4m.
Of this, a net 85.9m was spent in cash, 5.4m was non-cash pension costs, 17.3m was non-cash asset impairments, 0.4m was the net gain on property disposals, and 43.5m is expected to be met in cash payments for restructuring and redundancies in 2008.
A residual 7m relates to onerous lease provisions where cash will be incurred during and at the end of the lease life.
During the year, the Group incurred the following: 2007 2006 m m Exceptional items continuing operations Integration of RHM operations a 88.1 Integration of Campbell's UK operations b 12.4 8.0 Integration of Irish operations c 21.5 Restructure of Meat-free operations d 15.3 7.2 Costs of aborted acquisition of United Biscuits e 4.5 Birds transitional manufacturing and integration costs f 0.9 Restructuring and other costs g 21.8 1.9 Gain on property disposals h 0.4 3.1 Total 158.7 19.4 a Integration of RHM operations On 16 March 2007, the Group acquired RHM plc.
In order to achieve the planned synergy benefits from the acquisition, the Group incurred a significant level of expenditure and investment during the year.
The integration costs incurred relate to the following key projects and initiatives: The administrative functions of RHMs former head office at Marlow and its Culinary Brands business at Addlestone and Middlewich have been integrated into the existing Core Premier operations of the Group, resulting in redundancy and restructuring costs and the impairment of certain assets.
The administrative function at RHMs Manor Bakeries business at Windsor has been integrated into the existing Premier head office in St Albans, resulting in restructuring costs and the impairment of certain assets.
The redundancy costs arising from this have been provided at 31 December 2007, with our expectation that the majority will be expended during 2008.
65 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 On 2 July 2007, the Group announced the results of a review of its combined manufacturing facilities.
This review identified six sites that were to close and as a result a business wide restructuring programme was commenced, resulting in restructuring costs and the impairment of certain assets.
On 22 August 2007, the Group announced the closures of a bakery in Bradford and a depot in Telford, Shropshire.
This has resulted in redundancies, of which the majority of cash cost has been incurred in the current year and the impairment of certain assets.
b Integration of Campbells UK operations On 14 August 2006, the Group acquired Campbells Grocery Products Limited.
The administrative functions at Cambourne and Kings Lynn, as well as the manufacturing operations of Kings Lynn, have been integrated into the existing Core Premier operations of the Group, resulting in the impairment of certain assets, redundancy and restructuring costs.
c Integration of Irish operations Following the acquisitions of Campbells Grocery Products Ireland Limited in August 2006, Chivers Ireland Limited in January 2007, together with that of the RHM Ireland business in March 2007, the Group has significantly increased its operational and commercial presence in Ireland.
In the second half of the year the Group has completed the principal phase of integration of these businesses and has created a single operating company.
During the year, the Group also announced the closure of two sites at Coolock and Thurles, resulting in restructuring costs and the impairment of certain assets.
At the year end, redundancy costs have been provided with our expectation that the majority of cash spend will occur in 2008. d Restructure of Meat-free operations During 2006, the Group announced plans for the closure of its factory at Portishead and the purchase and development of a new chilled facility at Methwold, enabling the integration of chilled production for Quorn and Cauldron products.
The costs incurred in the first half of the year substantially related to the closure of Portishead and the costs incurred in the second half related to start up and commissioning of the new plant.
e Costs of aborted acquisition of United Biscuits During the prior year the Group entered into negotiations to acquire United Biscuits.
In doing so significant costs were incurred including consultancy, banking, due diligence, and legal fees, before discussions with the Group were terminated by the vendor.
f Birds transitional manufacturing and integration costs Following the acquisition of the Birds business from Kraft Foods Inc. the product range continued to be produced by Kraft Foods at their factory in Banbury under transitional arrangements.
In the previous year these arrangements were extended to ensure the continuity of supply and we have presented the additional cost of sourcing production from Kraft as exceptional costs.
g Restructuring and other costs There are a variety of other exceptional costs including redundancy and restructuring costs relating to other cost reduction initiatives, costs associated with our warehousing network, factory transformation and supply chain initiatives.
Training costs have been incurred associated with the implementation of a new ERP software suite and write off of aborted system implementation costs within the RHM business.
Other costs also include abandoned acquisition costs, compliance related initiative costs and costs incurred from the flooding damage at our site in Rotherham.
Prior year exceptional charges relate to costs associated with the restructuring of our warehousing network, compliance related initiatives and raw material write-offs resulting from their contamination in a third party warehouse.
h Gain on property disposals The net disposal gain of 0.4m in the year includes the disposal of certain plant and machinery as part of a sale and leaseback transaction, the disposal of our Ledbury factory, as identified in the manufacturing review completed during the year, and the disposal of a surplus property located in Ayr.
Disposal gains in 2006 relate to the disposal of our North Walsham factory which had previously been used for seasonal stock holding, and also an additional receipt relating to the sale of Langley Mill resulting from provisions in the disposal contract whereby the Group was entitled to a share of any profit made by the buyer on the subsequent sale of the property.

Interest payable and receivable On 16 March 2007, the Group entered into an Amended and Restated Facilities agreement, comprising a 1.5bn Term A facility, a 100m Term B facility, repayable over the period to 16 March 2012 and multi-currency revolving credit facilities of 500m.
As a result of these changes, debt issuance costs of 18.8m 2006: 4.4m were held on the balance sheet and are being amortised over the period of the loans.
Accelerated amortisation of debt issuance costs relates to the write off of 3.6m in relation to pre-existing credit facilities of Premier and 4.8m related to the RHM debt at acquisition which was repaid by Premier.

Loss earnings per share Basic loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 63.3m 2006: profit 47.1m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of the Company.

The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are share options.
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
As the Company has made a loss for the year ended 31 December 2007, the Companys potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents of 2,530,687 shares have an anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share and, therefore, have not been included in determining the total weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted net loss per share.
The issue of 348,324,199 ordinary shares on 16 March 2007 has been included in determining the weighted average for the current year see note 25.
No adjustment is made to the loss earnings in calculating undiluted and diluted loss earnings per share.

2006 equivalent dividends The equivalent dividends represent the amounts appropriate to the shareholders for each share, restated to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue in the prior year.
This equates to an uplift in the number of shares of 26.7% and hence a corresponding reduction in the dividend per share.

At 31 December 2007, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 42.6m 2006: 10.0m.
71 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 The impairment in 2007 of 15.9m relates to the integration of the administrative functions of RHMs former head office at Marlow, the Culinary Brands business at Addlestone and Middlewich, the Manor Bakeries business at Windsor, the announced closures of the six manufacturing sites as a result of the Groups manufacturing review, the announced closures of the bread manufacturing sites in Bradford and Plymouth, and a depot in Telford, the closure of the Kings Lynn manufacturing site as a result of the Campbell's integration and the closure of the Coolock and Thurles manufacturing sites as a result of the integration of the Irish operations.
The impairment charge in 2007 reflects the difference between the carrying value of assets and their expected recoverable amounts.
Recoverable amounts have been determined on the basis of value in use.
As at 31 December 2007, the rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows was 8.37% 2006: 8.50%.
The impairment in 2006 of 4.4m relates to the closure of the Cambourne office as a result of the Campbell's integration and the closure of the Portishead site as a result of the Meat-free restructuring.
The Groups borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group.

This represents the benefits available to the Group from a combination of future sales growth, the significant commercial savings and cost synergies to be achieved by the integration of administrative and manufacturing functions, an improved competitive position due to increased scale, the value attributed to RHMs workforce, and the opportunities available for category extension and new product launches.
Goodwill of 6.7m has arisen on the acquisition of Chivers Ireland and the goodwill attributed to Campbells has increased by 3.2m as a result of the finalisation of final fair values and acquisition costs which have been incurred refer note 27.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Confirmation of the CGU's carrying value is determined based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
Given that the products are closely related and share similar risks and rates of return, consistent Group discount rates are used for all CGU's.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
All projections are based on information approved by management in respect of the following five years cash flows.
A growth rate of 2% was applied to the perpetuity cash flows reflecting growth within the UK as a whole.
72 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued Assumptions are based upon events in prior periods as adjusted for expected developments in the following year with reference to market conditions.
All turnover and costs are taken into account and an estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain these cash flows is also made.
As at 31 December 2007, the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows was 8.37% 2006: 8.50%.
The unprecedented level of increases in wheat prices and decreased volume as a result of a general decline in consumption of bread in the UK, has adversely impacted the profitability of the Bread Bakeries CGU.
The Group has considered this impact on the assumptions used and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGUs carrying value.
This has not resulted in any impairment of the carrying value at 31 December 2007 as the CGUs recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value by 257m.
However, if the unprecedented cost pressures were to continue and only a 1% annual growth rate in the forecast cash flows is achieved, then this would result in the CGUs recoverable amount reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value.
There were no impairments resulting from the reviews performed in 2006 or 2007.

The remaining periods of amortisation for these assets are between 20 and 40 years for both the Campbells and RHMs brands.
The fair value attributed to customer relationships acquired as part of the acquisition of RHM plc, was 280.0m and represents the value of own label contracts with new and existing customers.
Customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 7 years.
Software and licences reflect the fair value adjustment in relation to the acquisition of RHM.
The fair value of licences at acquisition was 29.9m, which are amortised over the remaining lives of the licence agreements.
On the acquisition of Chivers Ireland, a fair value adjustment was recognised under IFRS 3 in respect of a beneficial property lease agreement.
As a result of the announcement to close the Coolock site, a 0.6m impairment was recognised.

76 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued a Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement 2007 On 16 March 2007, the Group entered into an amended and restated 2.1bn term and revolving credit facility.
This was arranged by Barclays Capital, Bayerische Landesbank, BNP Paribas, Rabobank International, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers and underwriters and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as facility agent and security trustee.
The Senior Term Credit Facility comprised 1.5bn Term A facilities and 100.0m Term B acquisition related facilities.
The Revolving Credit Facility is a multi-currency revolving credit facility of up to 500.0m or its equivalent in other currencies.
The final maturity date of the above arrangements is 16 March 2012.
These facilities were amended on 29 February 2008 to provide the Group with additional headroom.
See note 33 for further details.
b Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement 2006 On 14 August 2006, the Group entered into an amended and restated 1,085.0m term and revolving credit facility.
This was arranged by BNP Paribas, J. P. Morgan plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers and underwriters and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as facility agent and security trustee.
The Senior Term Credit Facility comprised 325.0m Term A facilities and 200.0m Term B facilities.
The Revolving Credit Facility was a multi-currency revolving credit facility of up to 560.0m or its equivalent in other currencies.
The final maturity date of the above arrangements was 6 June 2010, although all borrowings were fully repaid on 15 March 2007 and the facility terminated.
In addition the Group entered into a 450.0m bridging loan facility with ABN AMRO Bank N. V. and Merrill Lynch International on 12 July 2006 which was settled on 13 September 2006.
Financial instruments The Group is subject to the risks arising from adverse movements in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
The managing of these risks, along with the day-to-day managing of treasury activities is performed by the Group Treasury function.
The policy framework governing the managing of these risks is defined by the Treasury Committee which itself is a sub-committee appointed by the Directors.
These policies are reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee annually.
The framework for management of these risks is incorporated into a policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered commodities.
These contracts are part of the Group's normal purchasing activities and always result in receipt of raw materials.
a Market Risk i Foreign exchange risk The Groups functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling although some transactions are executed in nonsterling currencies, including Euros, US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Swiss Francs and Swedish Krona.
The transactional amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies against the pound.
Management of these exposures is centralised and managed by the Groups Treasury Function.
It is the Group's policy to manage the exposures arising using forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options.
Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions.
The Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, principally the Euro.
The translation exposure resulting from these Euro denominated profits and overseas net assets is hedged.
This matter is reviewed regularly by the Treasury Committee.
The principal foreign currency affecting the translation of subsidiary undertakings within the Group financial statements is the Euro.
The rates applicable are as follows: Year ended 31 Year ended 31 Principal rate of exchange EUR December 2007 December 2006 Year end 1.362 1.493 Average 1.460 1.470 77 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 The carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets are denominated in the following currencies: Cash at Trade and bank and in hand other receivables 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Currency Sterling 12.7 3.2 244.1 148.9 Euro 8.9 2.1 43.0 5.1 US Dollar 1.6 2.1 Other 0.7 0.4 23.9 7.8 287.1 154.0 The table below shows the Group's currency exposures as at 31 December 2007 and 2006 that gave rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Such exposures comprise monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiaries involved.
The amounts shown below are after taking into account the effect of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivative instruments entered into to manage these exposures.
Functional currency of the subsidiaries Sterling Euro Total m m m At 31 December 2007 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling 5.7 5.7 Euro 0.4 0.4 US Dollar 2.7 2.7 Other currencies 0.5 0.5 Total 2.8 5.7 8.5 At 31 December 2006 Net foreign currency monetary assets Sterling 0.2 0.2 Euro 4.2 4.2 US Dollar 2.0 2.0 Other currencies 0.8 0.8 Total 7.0 0.2 7.2 At 31 December 2007, if the Euro had weakened strengthened against sterling by 10% with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have decreased by 1.7m 2006: 3.8m or increased by 1.4m 2006: 3.1m.
At 31 December 2007, if the Dollar had weakened strengthened against sterling by 10% with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have decreased by 3.3m 2006: 3.9m or increased by 2.7m 2006: 3.2m.
ii Price risk The Group purchases a variety of commodities which can experience significant price volatility, which include inter-alia wheat, tinplate and energy.
The price risk on these commodities is managed by the Group through the Treasury Risk Management Committee.
It is the Groups policy to minimise its exposure to this volatility by adopting an appropriate forward purchase strategy or by the use of derivative instruments where they are available.
iii Cash flow and interest rate risk The Group borrows principally in pounds sterling at floating rates of interest and seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that reduce the level of exposure to floating rates.
The Group actively monitors its interest rate exposure, since the high level of debt makes its profitability sensitive to movements in interest rates.
The target of fixed capped debt is defined in the Group Treasury policy and procedures.
The Group will generally maintain a proportion of debt that is fixed or capped of no less than 30% and no more than 75%, however, this can be amended subject to agreement by the Treasury Committee.
The Group currently has a higher level of its debt economically hedged.
In addition the Group has entered into a debt securitisation programme which has the effect of reducing the interest cost by a further 40 basis points on the amount advanced.
Cash and deposits earn interest at floating rates based on banks short-term treasury deposit rates.
Short-term trade generally and other receivables are interest free.
78 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued The interest rate risk profile of the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities debt before issuance costs after taking account of the interest rate swaps used to manage the interest profile was: Fixed Floating rate capped rate Total m m m At 31 December 2007 58.2 1,567.5 1,625.7 At 31 December 2006 250.5 398.7 649.2 In addition, the Group's provisions of 74.3m as at 31 December 2007 2006: 8.2m for restructuring and other liabilities were considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
These cash flows are discounted where the effect is material.
Fixed rate financial liabilities Weighted Weighted average average period for interest which rate rate is fixed % in years Currency sterling At 31 December 2007 4.7 1.3 At 31 December 2006 4.8 2.6 The weighted average interest rates for fixed rate liabilities excludes the borrowing margin as the derivative instruments used to fix the interest rates are not allocated specifically against the Term and Revolving Credit Facilities.
The pricing basis for all floating rate borrowings is based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate LIBOR as adjusted by agreed interest margins.
If default occurs such as a breach of financial covenant the interest margin will immediately rise to 1.20% until the default has been corrected.
The analysis of average interest rates and years to maturity on fixed rate debt is after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
Exposure to movements in interest rates and years to maturity on fixed rate debt is after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
Since the year end the Group has amended the terms of its facilities by agreement with its banks, details are contained in note 33.

At 31 December 2007, if interest rates were 10 basis points higher lower, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit, excluding derivative fair value movements, would have decreased increased by 0.6m 2006: 0.2m.
At 31 December 2007, if interest rates were 50 basis points higher lower, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit, excluding derivative fair value movements, would have decreased by 2.8m 2006: 0.9m or increased by 1.5m 2006: 0.9m.
b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions and trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers though it is the Group's policy to insure trade debt.
As at 31 December 2007, the ageing of trade receivables was as follows: Fully performing 1-30 days 31-60 days 61-90 days 91-120 days 120 days Total m m m m m m m Trade receivables 2007 242.8 11.3 7.3 3.7 10.4 0.2 275.7 2006 137.6 3.4 2.2 0.3 0.8 0.2 144.5 79 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2007 2006 m m At 1 January 1.3 0.5 Provision for receivables on acquisition 5.1 Unused provision reversed 0.3 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectable 3.3 Provision for receivables impairment disposed 0.4 Provision for receivables impairment raised 1.0 0.8 At 31 December 3.4 1.3 These provisions of 3.4m 2006: 1.3m have been raised against gross trade receivables of 279.1m 2006: 145.8m.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security against its financial assets.
During December 2007, the Group put in place a 100m securitisation programme to allow it to transfer trade receivable balances to one of the Groups primary banks.
This programme also allows the Group to fide-link its own credit rating from that of the underlying assets and achieve a lower cost of funding.
c Liquidity risk The Group has negotiated facilities with its bankers that provide sufficient headroom to ensure liquidity and continuity of funding.
It has sufficient un-drawn banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity.
The Group tends to experience significant fluctuations in its short-term borrowing position due to seasonal factors, however, available revolving credit facilities are set at a level sufficient to meet the projected peak borrowing requirements.

The Group has 400m of facilities available and not drawn as at 31 December 2007 2006: 404.2m, expiring between 4 and 5 years.
The un-drawn facilities form part of the Group's overall working capital lines, the drawn down amounts of which bear interest at floating rates, subject to any hedge overlay, and are committed until 16 March 2012.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts is estimated by calculating the present value using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date using the Garman Kohlhagen model.
Where the model is unable to revalue the options, valuations are sought from reliable third parties.
For the purposes of valuing trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, the amounts, paid, payable, received or receivable are assumed to approximate fair value.
For retirement benefit obligations, the measurement of liabilities is defined and related assets are stated at market bid value.
For disclosure purposes the fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Set out below the table is a summary of methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instruments.

Hedge accounting has not been applied to forward contracts and as a result the movement in the fair value of 4.7m has been credited to the income statement in the year 2006: 3.5m charge.
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices.
Interest rate swaps are also not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the movement in the fair value of 31.0m has been charged to the income statement in the year 2006: 7.1m credit.
Short and long-term borrowings, loan notes and interest payable Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest rate cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
Trade and other receivables payables The carrying value of receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reflect the fair value given their short maturity.
The fair values of non-current receivables payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and nature of the balances involved.

The average lease term is 3 years, the longest being 10 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the average effective borrowing rate was 8.3% 2006: 6.5%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors title to the leased assets.
82 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued f Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Total borrowings 1,642.4 649.2 Less: cash and cash equivalents 23.9 7.8 Net debt 1,618.5 641.4 Total equity 1,460.3 461.0 Total capital 3,078.8 1,102.4 Gearing ratio 53% 58% 22.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset liability arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.
In all cases this is 28% except for an asset of 0.2m 2006: 0.1m relating to Irish retirement benefit obligations where the local rate of 12.5% has been used.

It is anticipated that the majority of these provisions will be utilised during 2008.
Other provisions primarily relate to dilapidations against leasehold properties.
The costs relating to these provisions will be incurred over a number of years in accordance with the length of the leases.
These provisions have been discounted at rates between 4.4% and 6.1%.
The unwinding of the discount is charged to the income statement under interest payable.
The 2006 provision amounts mainly relate to the restructuring of the Group's Meat-free operations, integration of Campbell's operations, and other redundancies.
84 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 24.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined Benefit Schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes as follows: The Premier Foods Pension Scheme the PFPS, is the principal funded defined benefit scheme within the pre-existing Premier Group.
The Group also operates a smaller funded defined benefit scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme the PAPPS for employees in the Ambrosia business.
As a result of the acquisition of Campbells in 2006, the Group inherited the Premier Grocery Products Pension Scheme PGPPS for the UK business and the Premier Grocery Products Ireland Pension Scheme PGPIPS for the Irish business.
The exchange rates used to translate the Campbells Ireland scheme which is denominated in Euros are 1.460 for the average rate during the year and 1.362 for the closing position at 31 December 2007.
During 2007 the Group inherited four further defined benefit schemes as a result of the acquisition of RHM, the RHM Pension Scheme, the RHM Ireland Employee Benefits Scheme 1994, the RHM Van Sales Scheme and the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements.
We also acquired two further schemes with the acquisition of Chivers Ireland, the Chivers 1987 Pension Scheme and the Chivers 1987 Supplementary Pensions Scheme.
Under the schemes, employees are entitled to retirement benefits which vary as a percentage of final salary on retirement.
The assets of all schemes are held by the trustees of the respective schemes and are independent of the Group's finances.
The schemes invest through investment managers appointed by the trustees in UK and European equities and in investment products comprising a broader range of assets.
For the purposes of these financial statements, pension costs presented are calculated by independent, qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The results for PFPS, PAPPS, PGPPS, PGPIPS and the Chivers Ireland schemes are presented together below as Core Premier and the results of the four RHM schemes are combined as RHM.
At the balance sheet date, the principal actuarial assumptions used for the principal schemes were as follows: Core Premier RHM 2007 2007 Discount rate 5.9% 5.9% Inflation 3.3% 3.3% Expected salary increases 4.3% 3.3% Future pension increases 3.3% 3.3% Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old male years Future service 19 21 Past service 17 19 Core Premier RHM 2006 2006 Discount rate 5.2% n a Inflation 3.0% n a Expected salary increases 4.0% n a Future pension increases 3.0% n a Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old male years Future service 18 n a Past service 15 n a For the smaller overseas schemes the discount rate ranges from 4.0% to 5.6%, expected salary increases from 3.3% to 4.0% and future pension increases from 2.5% to 3.3%.
The mortality assumption used is below the national average because it reflects the socio-economic profile of the membership and the schemes actual and anticipated mortality experience.
The mortality assumptions above for Core Premier relate to the main scheme, PFPS.
The mortality figures for the Premier Grocery Products Pension Scheme are 21 years for future service and 20 years for past service.

The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below.
For 2007, a summary of the Companys schemes is as follows: i The Company adopted an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS at the time of admission for executive directors.

ii A Savings Related Share Option Scheme for employees.
The employees involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 11.4m ordinary shares.
As a result of the acquisition of RHM plc on 16 March 2007, participants to RHMs Savings Related Share Option scheme had the choice to either exercise their options or roll over the options into an option of equivalent value of Premier Foods shares.
These options are equity-settled, have a maximum term of 3.5 years and generally vest only if employees remain in employment to the vesting date.
iii A Long-Term Incentive Plan for directors and senior managers.

Post balance sheet events Financing arrangements On 29 February 2008, the Group amended its Term and Revolving Credit Facilities by agreement with its lending banks to provide greater covenant headroom for the remainder of its financing period.
In addition it converted its 100m Acquisition line to a working capital line.
Moreover it renegotiated a further 125m of short-term facilities with three of its leading banks to provide additional liquidity headroom for the remainder of 2008.
As a consequence, the availability of facilities over the next three years is as follows: Available Facility Period m March December 2008 2,085.0 January December 2009 1,940.0 January March 2010 1,790.0 April December 2010 1,690.0 As part of the amendment process the covenant schedule for the Group has been reset to provide additional headroom.
The two covenants which the Group is required to meet are calculated and tested on a 12 month rolling basis at 30 June and 31 December each year.
For the next 12 months, those tests are as follows: June 2008 December 2008 Net Debt EBITDA 5.25:1 4.50:1 EBITDA Cash Interest 2.75:1 3.00:1 For the purposes of the calculation net debt is defined to exclude the Groups pension deficit, EBITDA is defined to include the pension financing credit and exclude exceptional items and cash interest is defined to exclude the amortisation of debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments.
