The differences are explained as follows: Year ended Year ended 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations before tax 18.4 9.2 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30% 5.5 2.8 EFFECTS OF: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.1 0.2 Non-deductible exceptional items 1.3 0.9 Utilisation of capital losses not previously recognised 2.1 Adjustments in respect of the prior year 1.9 0.8 Non-qualifying depreciation 1.2 3.3 Total tax charge credit from continuing operations for the year 3.8 2.3 On 21 March 2007 it was announced that the corporation tax rate will reduce from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
The legislation to enact this change was not in place at the balance sheet date and so this change is not recognised for deferred tax purposes.
Luminar plc 59 Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2007 6 DIVIDENDS Year ended Year ended 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Ordinary shares final dividend paid for 2006: 10.74p per share final dividend paid for 2005: 9.76p per share 7.8 7.1 Ordinary shares interim dividend paid for 2007: 4.88p per share interim dividend paid for 2006: 4.44p per share 3.6 3.2 11.4 10.3 In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the current financial year of 12.32p per share, which will absorb an estimated 8.6m of shareholders equity.
It will be paid on 24 July 2007 for shareholders on the register as at 22 June 2007.
This dividend is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, and has not been included as a liability within these financial statements in accordance with 1AS 10, Events after the balance sheet date.
7 EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of the basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options granted to Directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Groups ordinary shares during the year, and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan i. e. the Deferred Bonus Plan see note 27.
At the year end the performance criteria for the vesting of awards under certain share option schemes of the Group had not been met and consequently these potential shares are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
An alternative measure of earnings per share from continuing operations pre-exceptional items has been included below as the Directors believe that this measure of earnings per share is more reflective of the ongoing trading of the Group.
Reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Year ended 1 March 2007 Weighted average number Per share Earnings of shares amount m in millions pence BASIC EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 35.6 70.6 50.4 Effect of dilutive securities options 0.1 DILUTED EPS 35.6 70.7 50.4 Basic EPS from continuing operations 14.6 70.6 20.7 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 14.6 70.7 20.7 Basic EPS from discontinued operations 21.0 70.6 29.7 Diluted EPS from discontinued operations 21.0 70.7 29.7 EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PRE-EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Basic EPS from continuing operations pre-exceptional items 20.4 70.6 28.9 Diluted EPS from continuing operations pre-exceptional items 20.4 70.7 28.9 60 Consolidated Financial Statements Luminar plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 1 March 2007 7 EARNINGS PER SHARE continued Year ended 2 March 2006 Weighted average number Per share Earnings of shares amount m in millions pence BASIC EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 1.7 73.2 2.3 Effect of dilutive securities options 0.1 DILUTED EPS 1.7 73.3 2.3 Basic EPS from continuing operations 11.5 73.2 15.7 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 11.5 73.3 15.7 Basic EPS from discontinued operations 9.8 73.2 13.4 Diluted EPS from discontinued operations 9.8 73.3 13.4 EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PRE-EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Basic EPS from continuing operations pre-exceptional items 19.4 73.2 26.5 Diluted EPS from continuing operations pre-exceptional items 19.4 73.3 26.5 All amounts included in the column headed Earnings are taken from the face of the Consolidated Income Statement on page 43.
8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS A CONTINUING OPERATIONS The Group incurred exceptional items on continuing operations as follows: Year ended Year ended 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO TRADING UNITS Impairment of property, plant and equipment 2.8 0.1 Reversal of prior years impairment of property, plant and equipment 9.5 Impairment of goodwill 17.5 Reversal of provision for onerous lease commitments 0.6 Profit on sale and leaseback of property, plant and equipment 7.7 Costs relating to reorganisation and rationalisation 1.8 0.7 4.6 0.5 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO THE CLOSURE OF PROPERTIES Impairment of property, plant and equipment on closed units 2.5 8.2 on head office property 3.1 Provision for onerous lease commitments 3.2 3.1 Reversal of provision for onerous lease commitments 0.3 0.1 Net profit on insurance recovery due to fire 1.7 3.7 14.3 PRE-TAX EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS 8.3 14.8 TAX ON EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 2.5 6.9 POST-TAX EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS 5.8 7.9 The exceptional items recognised within continuing operations have been split between those which relate to units associated with the ongoing trading of the Group and those which relate to the closure of units.
These units, although closed, were not actively marketed prior to the balance sheet date.
As a result these units do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and therefore have been presented within continuing operations.
Luminar plc 61 Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2007 8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued i Exceptional items relating to trading units The impairment of property, plant and equipment of 2.8m 2006: 0.1m on trading units reflects the difference between the value in use of cash generating units e. g. discrete trading units and their carrying value.
2.1m of this impairment relates to trading units within the non-core segment and 0.7m relates to an unbranded dancing venue.
The development plans for these units are yet to be decided.
The reversal of prior years impairment charges of 9.5m in the year ended 2 March 2006 arose as the trigger causing the original impairment to be recognised had reversed, e. g. where it is now planned to re-brand a unit.
The impairment of goodwill of 17.5m in the prior year arose following the annual impairment test required under IFRS 3, Business combinations.
The impairment was recognised against goodwill allocated to the non-core segment.
Further details surrounding the impairment charges can be found in note 10.
A reversal of previously recognised provisions for onerous lease commitments of 0.6m in the year ended 2 March 2006 was recognised from changes to the intended use of the Groups units as a result of the re-branding strategy.
During the year ended 2 March 2006, the Group realised profits of 7.7m on the sale and leaseback of three sites Hemel Hempstead, the Milton Keynes head office and Bury St Edmunds, for a total consideration of 28.0m, received in cash.
Deferred income of 6.3m, relating to proceeds receivable above the fair value of the properties disposed, was recognised on the balance sheet at 2 March 2006 and is being amortised to the income statement over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Costs of reorganisation and rationalisation of 1.8m 2006: 0.7m have been incurred in respect of the restructuring of the Groups subsidiaries and recruiting key personnel.
In the prior year these costs related to relocating and rationalising the Groups administration centre.
ii Exceptional items relating to closed units The impairment of property, plant and equipment of 2.5m 2006: 8.2m, has principally arisen from the closure of two unbranded dancing units, pending a decision on their future development.
In the prior year a charge of 3.1m was incurred from the re-measurement to the fair value less costs of sale of the Groups former administration centres following the relocation of the head office to Milton Keynes.
During the year the former head office in Luton was sold for a consideration of 0.9m, generating a nil profit on disposal.
The charges arising from onerous lease commitments of 3.2m 2006: 3.1m are to recognise the obligation for rent and rates on currently vacant or closed units, where the likelihood of assignment of the lease or sub-let of the property is unlikely in the short term.
These units are closed or vacant following the relocation of the Groups administration centres, the closure of non-core sites not suitable for re-branding and the closure of an unbranded dancing unit, awaiting a future development plan.
During the year, 2.5m was received in relation to an insurance recovery claim against a unit which burnt down in 2005.
This unit had been impaired in 2006 to 0.3m, and therefore a profit of 2.1m, after incurring costs of 0.1m, has been recorded.
0.4m of this profit relating to business interruption, has been credited to administrative expenses.

The reversal of prior years impairment charges of 0.1m 2006: 2.5m has resulted from the upward re-measurement of units held for sale to the extent of previously recognised impairment charges.
The impairment of goodwill of 16.2m in the prior year arose following the annual impairment test required under IFRS 3, Business combinations, as a result of re-measuring non-core units held for sale at their fair value less costs of sale.
Costs of reorganisation and rationalisation of 1.2m 2006: 1.8m have been incurred in respect of the restructuring of the Groups subsidiaries and rationalising the Groups administration centre.
The provision for onerous lease commitments of 2.0m 2006: 3.8m, relating to sites presented within discontinued operations, has arisen from the closure of sites following the decision to exit from non-core operations.
The reversal of previously recognised provisions of 0.5m 2006: 1.1m has arisen as a result of re-measurement of units to their held for sale value, which is in excess of that assumed when the provision was created.
An exceptional loss on disposal of the Entertainment Division of 3.6m 2006: nil, has been recognised on completion of the sale on 19 January 2007.
The table below reconciles the loss on disposal of the Entertainment Division to that reported within the financial statements: m CONSIDERATION: Cash 76.8 Loan note 19.3 Value of investment in The 3D Entertainment Group Limited 30.6 126.7 ASSETS DISPOSED OF: Property, plant and equipment 123.3 Goodwill 2.6 Other non-current assets 1.9 Deferred income 1.9 Provisions 0.4 125.5 TRANSACTION COSTS 4.8 LOSS ON DISPOSAL 3.6 Value of investment reduced to 30.3m at the balance sheet date In the prior year an exceptional loss on disposal of the Enterprise Division of 3.0m was recognised on completion of the sale.
The loss on disposal of single sites of 0.3m 2006: 3.2m profit has arisen on the disposal of 12 units for consideration of 4.3m, all of which has been received in cash during the year.
Other costs of 1.5m have been incurred in relation to these disposals.
Of the 12 units disposed, payments totalling 2.6m were made to landlords in relation to the surrender of 3 leases.
Luminar plc 63 Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2007 9 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Comparative income statement and cash flow information is restated at each balance sheet date to reflect the composition of discontinued operations as at the latest balance sheet date.
A RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The results of discontinued operations, which comprise the Entertainment Division and the Enterprise Division in the prior year and other non-core units, either disposed of or held for sale, forming part of the Groups plan to exit from its non-core operations, included within the Consolidated Income Statement were as follows: Year ended Year ended 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Revenue 96.4 143.5 Administrative expenses 81.5 121.8 Finance costs 0.1 0.1 PROFIT BEFORE TAX PRE-EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 14.8 21.6 Attributable tax expenses 3.9 8.0 PROFIT AFTER TAX PRE-EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 10.9 13.6 Exceptional items: Re-measurement to held for sale 1.6 26.5 Loss on disposal of the Entertainment Division 3.6 Loss on disposal of the Enterprise Division 3.0 Other exceptional items 4.5 1.3 Attributable tax credits 19.8 7.4 NET PROFIT LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 21.0 9.8 On 19 January 2007 the Group completed the disposal of 98 venues comprising the Entertainment Division and non-core clubs.
The net loss realised on the disposal totalled 3.6m see note 8.
Consideration for the disposal totalled 96.1m, of which cash consideration represented 76.8m and an unsecured loan note with the vendor, The 3D Entertainment Group Limited, comprised 19.3m.
Cash disposed on the sale of the Entertainment Division totalled 0.8m, for which payment was made.
Consolidated net assets disposed amounted to 123.3m, of which the material amounts were property, plant and equipment, with costs and asset write-downs associated with the transaction above totalling 7.0m.
This transaction gave rise to 62.5m of negative goodwill in The 3D Entertainment Group Limited, of which the Groups share at 49% of 30.6m has been recognised immediately in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations.
During the year a tax credit of 19.8m 2006: 7.4m credit was recognised on exceptional items relating to discontinued operations.
This has arisen due to the release of the entire deferred tax liability carried in respect of the units disposed of during the year, principally the liability relating to the units sold as part of the Entertainment Division disposal.
B CASH FLOW FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 45 includes the following cash flows arising from discontinued operations: Year ended Year ended 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Net cash flows from operating activities 12.9 30.3 Net cash flows from investing activities 76.7 21.5 Net cash flows from financing activities 89.6 51.8 64 Consolidated Financial Statements Luminar plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 1 March 2007 9 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE continued C ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF UNITS HELD FOR SALE On 1 March 2007 19 units were classified as held for sale, of which 16 units were within the non-core segment and 3 were within the dancing segment.
Of the 19 units, 4 units have been unconditionally exchanged but have an agreed completion date of August 2007, 2 units have exchanged post-year end 1 for a sub-let and a further 4 units are with the lawyers for completion in the next few months 1 for a sub-let.
The remaining 9 units were actively being marketed at the balance sheet date and informal offers have been received against some of these units, which formed the basis for the estimates of fair value less costs of sale for these units.
A net charge of nil 2006: 25.9m has been recognised on re-measurement of units held for sale to fair value less costs of sale, which includes an upward revaluation to fair value less costs of sale of 0.1m, to the extent of previously recognised impairment losses.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the units classified as held for sale are as follows: 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Property, plant and equipment 13.0 30.5 Inventories 0.1 1.4 Trade and other receivables 0.5 1.3 Cash and cash equivalents 0.2 TOTAL ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE 13.6 33.4 Trade and other payables 0.9 6.4 Finance lease obligations 0.8 1.5 Deferred income 0.2 0.6 Provisions 1.8 3.7 TOTAL LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE 3.7 12.2 NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 9.9 21.2 10 GOODWILL m COST Brought forward at 3 March 2006 216.1 Disposals 23.4 AT 1 MARCH 2007 192.7 ACCUMULATED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES Brought forward at 3 March 2006 38.6 Disposals 20.8 AT 1 MARCH 2007 17.8 CARRYING AMOUNT AT 1 MARCH 2007 174.9 m COST Brought forward at 28 February 2005 208.0 Recognised on acquisition of trade and assets of a business 8.1 AT 2 MARCH 2006 216.1 ACCUMULATED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES Brought forward at 28 February 2005 4.9 Impairment losses for the year 33.7 AT 2 MARCH 2006 38.6 CARRYING AMOUNT AT 2 MARCH 2006 177.5 Luminar plc 65 Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2007 10 GOODWILL continued The majority of the Groups goodwill, excluding the 8.1m of goodwill which arose on the acquisition of 13 units from The Nightclub Company TNC in the prior year, arose from the acquisition of units that now predominantly form part of the dancing segment and which were acquired from either Allied Leisure plc on 6 December 1999 or from Northern Leisure Plc on 11 July 2000.
Goodwill by segment A Cash Generating Unit CGU is deemed to be an individual operating unit, as each unit generates profits and cash flows that are largely independent from other units.
Where multiple CGUs are acquired as part of a single business combination, the goodwill arising from the business combination is attributed to individual CGUs, but is grouped together at a segment level, being the lowest level that management monitors goodwill.
Accordingly, CGUs have been grouped together at a segmental level for the purpose of the annual impairment review of goodwill.
At the year end, 172.5m of goodwill was attributed to the dancing segment 2006: 173.0m, and 2.4m to the non-core segment 2006: nil, which related to 5 units formerly within the entertainment segment 2006: 4.5m.
Impairment of goodwill In assessing whether a write-down of goodwill is required to the carrying value of the related asset, the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs, is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount for each CGU, and collectively for groups of CGUs that make up the segments of the Groups business, has been measured based on value in use VIU, with the exception of those units that were held for sale at the balance sheet date, where the recoverable amount for these units has been based on fair value less costs to sell.
For the purposes of the annual impairment review, the recoverable amount for each of the Groups segments has been estimated on the following bases: Dancing: VIU: Non-core: VIU, or fair value less costs of sale for those CGUs held for sale at the balance sheet date.
The Group estimates the VIU of its CGUs using a discounted cash flow model, DCF, which adjusts the cash flows for risks associated with the assets, and are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 11.0% 2006: 11.5%.
The discount rate used is consistent across both segments.
The VIU calculations have not included the benefits arising from any future asset enhancement expenditure, as this is not permitted by IAS 36.
The VIU calculations therefore exclude the significant benefits anticipated from future refurbishments, together with the related capital expenditure, resulting from the re-branding programme.
The growth rates included within the assumptions supporting the VIU calculations do not therefore represent the Groups anticipated total forecast growth, but rather the growth deriving from refurbishments completed by the balance sheet date.
Fair value less costs to sell has been based on external offers received for CGUs held for sale, or valuations from internal and external property experts if no offers have been received to date.
Management have performed the annual impairment review of goodwill as required by IAS 36.
No impairment was required in either the dancing segment or the non-core segment based on the value in use calculation, reflecting the strong performance of the dancing segment and the 5 former entertainment units.
During the year ended 2 March 2006, a write-down of 33.7m of goodwill in the non-core segment was recognised.
17.5m of this charge had been recognised through exceptional items within continuing operations and 16.2m through exceptional items within discontinued operations.
The impairment arose from the re-measurement of those units held for sale to their fair value less costs of sale and from downward revisions to prior estimates of VIU following sales performance in the segment during the current year.
Goodwill allocated to the dancing segment Only the goodwill allocated to the dancing segment is significant in comparison to the total carrying value of the Groups goodwill.
The key assumptions required for the VIU calculation for the Dancing Division are sales and EBITDA growth.
The Group has used formally approved budgets for the first year of its VIU calculation.
The VIU for years two to five has been based on forecast sales and EBITDA growth decline.
Declining sales and EBITDA arises as a result of the exclusion of future refurbishment expenditure from the VIU calculation, rather than using formally approved budgets.
A terminal value assuming nil growth due to no refurbishment expenditure being included in the VIU calculation, has been calculated to cash flows after year five.
Management believe that no reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the VIU calculation would cause the carrying value of the dancing segment goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Due to the predominately cash based nature of the Groups operations, the only financial instruments that materially expose the Group to any of the financial risks detailed in the notes below are debt financing and related interest rate swaps, and the disclosures that follow relate principally to these items.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to reduce its exposure to financial risk.
The use of such financial instruments constitutes an integral part of the Groups funding strategy.
The Group manages its derivative financial instrument credit risk by only undertaking transactions with relationship banks holding good credit ratings.
Such transactions are governed by Board policies and procedures.
Further details regarding the Groups financial risk management policies can be found within the Business Review on pages 18 and 19.
A INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The interest rate exposure of the Groups financial assets was as follows: Fixed rate at year end Fixed Floating Floating Interest Time rate rate Total interest rate rate period m m m %% Years 1 MARCH 2007 34.0 34.0 5.6 3.3 2 March 2006 72.1 72.1 3.2 On demand Included within the financial assets with fixed rates for the prior year, are cash and cash equivalents related to units held for sale of 0.2m.

C BORROWING FACILITIES The Groups undrawn floating facilities at the balance sheet date were as follows: 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Expiring after two years 116.7 70.0 Following the disposal of the Entertainment Division, a temporary cap was placed on the Groups undrawn floating facilities at 90.0m and since the year end, the facility has been reduced by 100.0m to 90.0m.
Of these facilities, 116.7m 2006: 70.0m is committed and secured by means of a floating charge over the Groups current and future assets.
The floating charge also secures the bank loans drawn down of 73.3m in B above.

ii The fair value of the loan note receivable approximates to book value.
iii Drawings made under the Groups floating rate facility, where fair value approximates to book value.
iv Finance lease liabilities at fixed rate: given the length of time to maturity of these liabilities and the length of time since inception of the lease, the fair value of these liabilities at the balance sheet date is lower than current book value.
v The fair value of interest rate swaps has been determined with reference to market rates at the balance sheet date.
At 2 March 2006 the book value of these swaps equated to their fair value as these derivatives were stated at their fair value under IAS 39.
There are no interest rate swaps in place at 1 March 2007.
E HEDGES ON FUTURE TRANSACTIONS The Groups policy is to manage interest rate risk by hedging 50% of the bank facility, using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
However, given the low level of drawn down funds during 2007, there is currently no hedging in place.
The position is kept under constant review and suitable arrangements will be put in place when deemed appropriate.

Luminar plc 75 Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2007 24 PROVISIONS continued ONEROUS LEASES Provisions for onerous leases represent onerous commitments on operating leases for properties currently vacant or for closed units, where assignment of the lease or sub-let of the property is unlikely in the short term.
Provision is made for rent and related property costs for the period management estimate the property would not be sub-let, or until assignment of the lease is probable, and ranges up to 8 years.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment, if this represents the least cost to exit from the commitment.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows relating to onerous leases are subject to variations.
In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows management utilise the skills and experience of both internal and external property specialists, and are satisfied that the resulting estimated provision is appropriate.
PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE Provision for public liability insurance is made for the estimated exposure of the Group to claims, based upon experience of historical claims.
This provision is expected to be utilised within 2 years.
OTHER PROVISIONS Other provisions represent redundancy costs of 0.2m associated with the rationalisation of the Groups administration centre and costs associated with a legal proceeding of a type typical to the Groups business of 0.1m, and are expected to be utilised within 12 years.
25 DEFERRED TAX m Brought forward at 3 March 2006 43.9 Credit recognised in income statement 17.5 Credit recognised in equity 0.5 AT 1 MARCH 2007 26.9 The analysis of the year end deferred tax position is as follows: 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m On property, plant and equipment 23.5 42.7 Other temporary differences 3.4 1.2 26.9 43.9 During the year a tax credit of 19.8m 2006: 7.4m credit was recognised in exceptional items relating to discontinued operations.
Deferred taxation provided for in the financial statements at the year end represents provision at 30% on the temporary differences between the accounting net book amount of property, plant and equipment, and the tax base of those assets.
The deferred tax liability has been calculated using estimates based on the current manner of recovery of the assets value on property, plant and equipment not eligible for capital allowances, i. e. recovery through continued use in the business unless the asset is held for sale.
This method assumes no tax relief will be available: therefore, no tax base is available for inclusion within the calculation of the deferred tax liability, unless the assets value is recovered through sale rather than continued use.
The key assumptions in the calculation of deferred tax are set out below: Capital expenditure.
The percentage of the Groups capital expenditure that would qualify for tax relief, incurred by each unit, has been estimated based on prior periods historical experience of the split between qualifying and non-qualifying expenditure: Impairments.
The impairments to property, plant and equipment have been apportioned between assets qualifying for tax relief and those that do not.
The rate of depreciation for assets that do not qualify for the initial recognition exemption has been estimated based on actual data for the most recent accounting periods.
A review of the deferred tax liability will be performed at each balance sheet date and adjustments made in the event of a change in any key assumptions.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has estimated unused capital gains tax losses of 29.0m available for offset against future taxable profits from capital disposals.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams available to offset these losses.

During the year 19,352 shares were issued for a cash consideration of 90,204 to satisfy exercises of options under the Groups Save-As-You-Earn option scheme.
DEFERRED BONUS PLAN Additional potential issues of ordinary shares may arise under the terms and conditions of the Deferred Bonus Plan, as described in note 27.
27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group has followed the transitional arrangements within IFRS 2, Share-based payment, and has adopted the exemption from full retrospective application of all share-based payment awards, and has only applied the measurement requirements of IFRS 2 to awards made after 7 November 2002.
However, the following disclosures include all share-based payment awards, therefore including those equity-settled awards granted prior to 7 November 2002.
The Group operates the following share-based payment plans: a Deferred Bonus Plan In March 2004 the shareholders approved the establishment of the Deferred Bonus Plan, the Plan, which seeks to incentivise, retain and reward Executive Directors.
Under the terms of the Plan, 50% of the bonus entitlement of Executive Directors is deferred, being credited to the purchase of notional shares in the Group within the plan.
The earliest vesting of notional shares awarded under the plan is three years after the crediting of the notional holding.
Any dividends accrued on the notional shares are accrued to the benefit of the Executive Directors.
The Group will award matching shares, based on the shareholder return of the Group relative to the FTSE 250 Index over the relevant three year period.
Initial awards will vest after three years and are dependent on the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The settlement of benefits accruing under the Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Accounting for the plan has assumed that awards will be equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive Director remains in the service of the Group, unless in exceptional circumstances.
b 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme & 1999 Company Share Option Plan Options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are granted to senior employees at the market price of the Groups ordinary shares, determined by the average of the mid-market price of one ordinary share on the three days preceding the date of grant.
The share options are exercisable between three and ten years from the grant date, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance targets and the employee remaining in the service of the Group.
For the 1999 Company Share Option Plan, the options granted require a minimum pre-exceptional items and pre-tax Earnings Per Share growth of RPI 5% per annum compounded over a three year period.
For the 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme, the options granted in 1998 and 1999, require a minimum pre-exceptional items and pre-tax Earnings Per Share growth of RPI 20% per annum compounded over a three year period.
Options granted from 2000 to 10 July 2002, and from 9 December 2002 to 25 July 2006, require minimum growth of RPI 5% and 3% respectively per annum, compounded over a three year period.
All options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive remains in the service in the Group, unless in exceptional circumstances.
c Northern Leisure 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme Rolled over options Options granted under the Northern Leisure scheme are granted to holders of existing super options of Northern Leisure Plc, who have elected to release these in exchange for an equivalent option over Luminar plc shares.
The options vest from three to ten years from grant date of the original super options.
All options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and accordingly are excluded from the scope of IFRS 2.
78 Consolidated Financial Statements Luminar plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 1 March 2007 27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued d SAYE scheme Options granted under the all-employee Save-As-You-Earn scheme are available to all Executive Directors and employees with over one years service, with options granted at the prevailing market rate, with no discount given on grant.
Options are exercisable three years after the date of grant, with options exercisable for an 18 month period following the earliest vesting date.
If the employee does not withdraw savings from the plan, all options are equity-settled.
e Warrant scheme On 22 February 1999 the shareholders approved the establishment of a discretionary Trust to hold warrants as part of incentive arrangements under which they are subsequently allocated to employees.
Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at the price of 6.67 per share.
Performance criteria attached to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002, and an allocation of 50% of the warrants was made by the Trustee in May 2002.
The remaining warrants are allocable in the absolute discretion of the Trustee who may call for guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
The subscription period in the approved scheme provides that warrants may be exercised in the period of 28 days following the publication of the Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 1 March 2009.
More details on the 1999 warrant scheme trust can be found within the Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 35. f Jools Holland The options granted were exercisable five years after the date of grant, and were exercisable for a six month period thereafter, if Mr Holland was still involved with the Group and the Jam House brand at vesting date.
The options lapsed on 2 January 2007. g Restricted share award In July 2006, the Remuneration Committee made a one-off retention award of 47,900 restricted shares to Nick Beighton, the Finance Director.
This grant was made in recognition of the fact that no share options or performance shares had been granted to Mr Beighton on or since his appointment in August 2005, due to the delayed implementation of the new long-term incentive plan.
Furthermore, it was felt that Mr Beighton had performed at an exceptional level since his appointment and that he was instrumental in completing the successful reorganisation of the business in 2006.
The strategic, one-off grant of restricted shares was deemed necessary to secure his retention during this critical period and was made under the terms of paragraph 9.4.
The shares will vest 50% in July 2007 and 50% in July 2008, subject to his continued employment with Luminar.
Awards will vest early in the event of a change of control.
h One-off Phantom Long-term Incentive Award to the Chairman In order to secure the services of Alan Jackson as Chairman, the Remuneration Committee considered it necessary to offer a one-off cash award over 73,314 notional shares, granted under Listing Rule 9.4.
Vesting of the Phantom Award is based on the Groups TSR performance over a three year vesting period.
40% of the Phantom Award will vest if Luminars TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company.
The Phantom Award will vest in full if Luminars TSR is equal to or above the TSR of the upper quartile company.
Straight-line vesting will occur between these points.
TSR values will be the average over the three months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period.
In the event of a change of control or if Mr Jackson leaves in certain compassionate circumstances, performance will be measured over the shorter period and awards will be scaled back on a time pro-rata basis.

The Group recognised a total credit within administrative expenses of 0.1m 2006: 0.2m charge, related to share-based payment transactions, all of which were accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with a corresponding debit direct to equity reserves.
The cumulative credit to equity reserves in respect of share-based payments totalled 0.4m 2006: 0.5m.

At the year end, the operating leases which had been sold to The 3D Entertainment Group Limited, had not yet been assigned due to the time taken to liaise with the landlords.
Therefore, the commitment above includes those leases yet to be assigned, for which there is an equal and offsetting expected rental income to be received from The 3D Entertainment Group Limited.
Similarly, rents paid to the landlord on behalf of The 3D Entertainment Group Limited are included within sub-lease payments for the year, and the rental receipts from The 3D Entertainment Group Limited are shown within sublease income.
