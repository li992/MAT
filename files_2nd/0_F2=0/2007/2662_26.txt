The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
Accounting policies continued Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found below: Revenue recognition note 3 Financial Tax note 7 statements Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 11 134 Payment processor receivables note 15 Provisions note 21 Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities note 23 Share-based payments note 28 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
The functional and presentational currency used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements is United States Dollars USD.
The functional currency is the currency in which the parent company operates and it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Group.
A minority of Group companies operate in local currencies but the amounts involved are not material.
Assets, liabilities and expenses of the Group are translated from local currencies into US dollars as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate existing at the balance sheet date: income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates existing at the dates of the transactions or at a rate that approximates the actual exchange rates: equity items other than the net profit or loss for the period that are included within retained earnings are translated at the closing rate existing at the balance sheet date: and any exchange differences arising from the above translations are recognised in the income statement.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly by PartyGaming Plc.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Except as noted below, the financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting, and are consolidated from the date of acquisition i. e. the date on which control of the subsidiary effectively commences to the date of disposal i. e. the date on which control over the subsidiary effectively ceases.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting policies continued Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited formerly Headwall Ventures Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The Directors note that transactions under common control are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and that there is no guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS.
This guidance is included at paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS does not include guidance for a particular issue, the Directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards.
In this regard, it is noted that the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued an accounting standard covering business combinations FAS 141 that is Financial similar in a number of respects to IFRS 3. statements In contrast to IFRS 3, FAS 141 does include, as an Appendix, limited accounting guidance for transactions under 135 common control which, as with IFRS 3, are outside the scope of that accounting standard.
The guidance contained in FAS 141 indicates that a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests accounting, which was previously set out in Accounting Practices Board APB Opinion 16, may be used when accounting for transactions under common control.
Having considered the requirements of IAS 8, and the guidance included within FAS 141, it is considered appropriate to use a form of accounting which is similar to pooling of interests when dealing with the transaction in which the Company acquired its controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited.
Associates Where the Group has the power to exercise significant influence over but not control the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it is classified as an associate.
Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in excess of the Groups investment in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate.
The investors share in the associates profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate.
The carrying amount of the associate is tested under IAS 36 for impairment wherever the application of the requirements of IAS 39 indicate that the carrying value of the associate might be impaired.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
Foreign currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate ruling when the transaction occurs.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into the Groups functional and presentational currency US dollars at exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated in to US dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognised directly in equity, and are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to the income statement.
Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising Poker including Emerging Games, Casino including Bingo, Sports Betting and skins third-party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services, is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange gains on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees.
Poker including Emerging Games revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament.
Casino including Bingo and Sports Betting revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on open betting positions.
Revenue in respect of skin arrangements where the skin owns the relationship with the customer, is the net commission invoiced.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is net of certain promotional bonuses and the value of PartyPoints accrued.
Revenue generated from foreign Financial exchange gains on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
statements Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
136 Segment information A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment.
In accordance with best practice, the Group has early adopted IFRS 8 Operating segments.
This standard is concerned with the way in which companies report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial disclosures.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the business segments within the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance.
The Group reviews financial statements presented by product type which are supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Accounting policies continued The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Financial All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of statements freehold land and buildings which are stated at cost and are not depreciated.
137 Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment 33% per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Intangible assets Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
For acquisitions during the year, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between 18 months and five years.
Internally generated assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future Financial cashflows have not been adjusted.
statements If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 138 the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled sharebased payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in the income statement.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by The Bonita Trust, the charge is recorded when the Trustees commit to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Accounting policies continued Treasury shares The consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve.
Any excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the Shares sold is credited to the share premium account.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the balance sheet when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, no provision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of outflow Financial of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
statements Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at 139 a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments A substantial portion of the Groups revenue is received in its functional currency.
As such, currency exposure on revenues is low.
Further, the Group minimises foreign currency exposure by netting non-US dollar deposits and payments of winnings in the respective currency.
Additionally, other exposures include interest rate risk from borrowing and the investment of cash balances.
The Group seeks to limit these risks by investing cash in short-term instruments and interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency cashflows and to hedge foreign exchange risk on non-US dollar denominated financial assets and liabilities.
The derivative instruments used by the Group consist mainly of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value calculated using either discounted cashflow techniques or by reference to market prices supplied by banks.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement.
The Group presently does not adopt any form of hedge accounting as described in IAS 39 and does not anticipate any requirement to do so in the foreseeable future.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans and receivables.
These include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents.
There are no financial assets that are classified as held to maturity or available for sale.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying values of the Groups financial assets recorded in the Groups consolidated balance sheet are a reasonable approximation to their fair values.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They arise principally through the amounts due from payment processors that remit funds on behalf of customers, the prepayment of suppliers and other types of contractual monetary asset and Financial cash and cash equivalents.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to statements their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, 140 less any provisions for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Financial liabilities: The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due from progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the balance sheet.
Bank borrowings and overdrafts which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
A category for out of the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Revenue allocated to Discontinued operations represents revenue generated from players located in the US.
Other administrative expenses allocated to Discontinued operations in the year primarily represent legal fees incurred in respect of the Groups ongoing discussions with the DoJ regarding its activities before the enactment of the UIGEA.
The Group is discussing with its insurers reimbursement of certain of these fees.
However, as the policy allowing the recovery of these fees has not yet formally been triggered, these costs have been expensed in full during the period.
Distribution expenses allocated to Discontinued operations in the year represent a commitment made in respect of a product placement agreement with Harrahs License Company LLC for The World Series of Poker.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA, the Group sought to renegotiate the product placement agreement in order to amend its scope and cost, specifically looking to focus on non-US markets only.
However, mutually acceptable commercial terms could not be agreed between the parties and so the contract remained in place resulting in a charge being incurred in 2007.
Reorganisation costs allocated to Discontinued operations relate to reorganisation costs arising from the decision to terminate all real money games to customers in the US following the enactment of the UIGEA.
Tax allocated to Discontinued operations relates to provisions made in respect of non-US corporate taxes attributable to income from Discontinued operations.
PartyGaming Plc Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.
Revenue and business segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Groups operations can be segmented into the following three operating divisions: Poker including Emerging Games : Casino including Bingo : Sports Betting: These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the entity as a whole and cannot be allocated to individual segments.
Following a reorganisation of the management and internal reporting of the business to place more emphasis on vertical product groups at the end of 2006, the majority of marketing costs are now allocated to each business Financial segment based on the revenue generated by new sign-ups in that period.
The 2006 data has been restated on statements a consistent basis.
142 In the latter part of 2007, the Group implemented geographic operational changes and has also been able to undertake a further review of developments in the approaches that may be taken by tax authorities in major jurisdictions.
As a consequence there has been a reversal of a creditor in the Groups balance sheet, the charge for which had historically been deducted from revenue, resulting in a corresponding one-off credit of $18.2 million to revenue in 2007.
This adjustment is non-cash and non-recurring in nature.
During 2007, $9.6 million has been derived from inactive fees and similar items included in net revenue.
In prior years, these were netted against operating costs as they were not material.

Of this $2.2 million, some $2.0 million relates to Discontinued operations and $0.2 million relates to Continuing operations.
Prior to flotation, the Principal Shareholders established the PartyGaming Plc Share Option Plan the Nil-Cost Plan for the benefit of the current and future workforce.
Under the terms of the Nil-Cost Plan each option takes the form of a right, exercisable at nil-cost, to acquire Shares in the Company, the vesting of which are satisfied by existing shares which had been issued to the Employee Trust.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA, the Company implemented on 29 December 2006 a one-off adjustment to existing incentive awards and also granted new incentive awards by using an additional 40 million Shares gifted to the Employee Trust by certain founders of the Company.
As such, the exercise of these options has no dilutive effect on Shareholders who subscribed at the IPO and will have no cash impact on the Company.
IFRS requires that the fair value of the options be amortised through the income statement over the life of the options.
Share-based payments continued As part of a key employee retention programme, the Company waived the total Shareholder return performance targets that were applicable to 20 million out of the 27 million Shares over which an option was granted to Mitch Garber, Chief Executive Officer, on 19 April 2006 under the Nil-Cost Plan.
The vesting schedule was also accelerated so that these 20 million Shares vested in eight monthly tranches of 1.25 million Shares from 19 May 2007 to 19 December 2007 with the remainder vesting on 19 April 2008.
Mitch Garber was also granted a new option under the Nil-Cost Plan over 15 million Shares, vesting in 30 equal monthly tranches until 1 May 2009.
Provided he remains in employment until 1 May 2009 he will also be awarded 2 million Shares from the Employee Trust.
As part of the key employee retention exercise the Company also accelerated the vesting of the option granted to Martin Weigold, Group Finance Director, on 6 April 2005 under the Nil-Cost Plan, so that the balance of his unvested Shares 8,897,776 Shares would vest in nine equal quarterly tranches until 31 December 2008.
Financial An additional grant over 8,897,776 Shares was also made which vests in the same instalments as the statements aforementioned option.
145 Further nil-cost options over approximately 50 million Shares have been granted to other key employees of the Group.
The charge associated with the nil-cost options decreased from $86.4 million in 2006 to $71.6 million in 2007.
Mitch Garber is also entitled to 3 million payable by the Employee Trust in 30 equal monthly instalments until 1 May 2009 provided he remains in employment on each payment date.
The 3 million has been realised from the net proceeds of sale of Shares from the Trust.
Following the introduction during the first half of 2007 of two fair market value option plans, the PartyGaming Plc All-Employee Option Plan FMV Plan and PartyGaming Plc Executive Share Option Plan Executive FMV Plan, and an equity plan, the PartyGaming Plc Performance Share Plan PSP Plan, the total charge during the period relating to these options was $7.5 million 2006: $nil.
This primarily reflected an issue of share options to the Groups employees under the FMV Plan.
Under this plan, options vest over a three year period and the majority were granted at an exercise price of 45.75 pence per Share.

Tax continued b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The total charge for the year can be reconciled to accounting profit as follows: 2007 2006 Year ended 31 December $million $million Profit loss before tax Continuing operations 6.7 77.4 Loss profit before tax Discontinued operations see note 2 26.0 216.3 Loss profit before tax 19.3 138.9 Tax at the weighted average tax rate of the Group being tax credit expense at the 1.0 13.9 effective tax rate for the period Effect of share-based payments, depreciation and amortisation 4.0 10.9 Financial Effect of adjustment to the weighted average tax rate of the Group being tax credit at the statements effective tax rate for prior periods 63.9 14.3 146 Income tax credit expense 60.9 10.5 The Groups policy is to manage, control and operate Group companies only in the countries in which they are registered.
At the period end there were Group companies registered in 12 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial statements.
In calculating the tax provision, in addition to any amounts due in respect of jurisdictions in which Group companies are currently incorporated or domiciled, provisions have been made to cover the Directors best estimate of additional taxation exposures which may arise.
Where the actual outcome differs from the amounts originally recorded, the tax and any deferred tax provisions will be affected in the period s in which the determination is made.
In the latter part of 2007, the Group implemented geographic operational changes and has also been able to undertake a further review of approaches that may be taken by taxation authorities in major jurisdictions.
Additionally, more detailed guidance has been published such that it is now the broad consensus of OECD member countries that the automated nature of the functions performed by eCommerce equipment means that the assets or risks attributable to it are only likely to be those directly associated with technology hardware and that, in the absence of personnel acting on behalf of an enterprise, little or no profit should be attributed to eCommerce activity.
Accordingly the Directors have revised their estimate, resulting in a release in the 2007 financial year of a tax provision brought forward of $64.5 million.
The Group has received indemnities from the Principal Shareholders in connection with certain potential historic corporate taxation liabilities.
The Directors consider the likelihood of any such liability arising to be remote.
Accordingly, neither has a provision for any such potential taxation been made, nor has an asset been recognised in respect of the indemnity.
c Factors that may affect future tax charges In Gibraltar, the Group benefits from the exempt company regime.
The Gibraltar exempt company regime will be phased out by 31 December 2010: assessable income is taxed in Gibraltar at the mainstream corporation tax rate.
In India, the Group benefits from a tax holiday on income from qualifying activities until March 2009: under current rules assessable income is taxed in India at approximately 33.7%.
A Minimum Alternative Tax MAT of 10% was introduced in 2007 with effect from April 2007.
Fringe benefit tax is payable at approximately 33.7% on a proportion of specified benefits provided or deemed to have been provided to past and present employees.

Basic earnings per Share Basic earnings per Share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the Company.

Clean EBITDA and Clean earnings per Share are performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the impact of one-off and non-cash items.
They are therefore calculated before reorganisation costs, non-cash charges relating to share-based payments, non-recurring adjustment to revenue and release of tax provision.

The values are based on cashflow projections from existing customers taking into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
They are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 December 2007 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived from those assets using cashflow projections for a three to five year period.
The discount rates for the review were based on company specific pre-tax weighted average cost of capital percentages and ranged from 9% to 15%.
The future cashflows have been modelled to decline in line with historic player attrition patterns which are consistent with those experienced by the Group in recent years.
The results of the review undertaken at 31 December 2006 indicated that impairment totalling $115.5 million, predominantly in respect of Empire Poker, was necessary in respect of the intangible assets, arising due to the enactment of the UIGEA.

Contingent liabilities From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such claims and actions.
a Regulatory issues As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments and their potential impact on the business and continues to take appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and barred such customers from wagering real money on all of the Groups sites.
Notwithstanding this, the actions taken by certain US regulatory authorities suggest that there remains a residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US prior to the enactment of the UIGEA.
Furthermore, the Group is aware that certain US regulatory authorities have made enquiries of banks and other financial advisers that have had involvement with the internet gaming industry.
Certain customary indemnities have been given by the Company to its advisers in connection with the Companys initial public offering in June 2005 and other assignments, and claims under such indemnities cannot be ruled out.
The Group has not, however, received notice of any such claim to date.
On 4 June 2007, the Company announced that it had initiated discussions with the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and is in the process of voluntarily responding to a request for information issued by that office.
These discussions are progressing and it is possible that an agreement will be reached in the foreseeable future.
The Board believes that a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential liability in connection with this matter cannot be made.
Furthermore, the Board believes that the disclosure of any range of potential settlement would be prejudicial to the Groups interests.
b Litigation The Group is the defendant in a US action which is based on alleged collusion taking place on the Groups online poker tables.
This action has been brought by two individual plaintiffs who are seeking class certification.
The class seeking to be represented comprises poker customers in the US who from 1 January 2002 played real money games on the Groups sites.
The Group believes the action to be speculative, without merit and open to challenge on a number of grounds.
The Group had not hitherto submitted to US jurisdiction and therefore the action had not been contested.
In light of a number of factors, not all of which pertained at the time of the decision not to contest, the Group has decided to seek to challenge the proceedings and will accordingly seek to enter a defence and contest the action on the merits.
The Board believes that the disclosure of a range of potential liability, if any, would be prejudicial to the Groups interests.

Financial instruments and risk management In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: Trade receivables Prepayments Cash at bank and cash equivalents Bank loans Trade payables Foreign exchange contracts Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2007 or in the prior period.
Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the year ended 31 December 2007 or in the prior period.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on annual basis which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
Financial The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark statements exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies would also 157 be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported to management on a weekly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function.
Internal control reviews were undertaken during 2006 and 2007 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from payments service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a weekly basis, The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of $150 million that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration of refinancing risk.
The Group was required to make a final payment Euro 22.3 million on 1 February 2008 representing a retention to the vendors of the Gamebookers business activity acquired in August 2006.
This payment was met out of existing cash resources whilst maintaining a positive Client Liability Cover.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
Capital risk In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, the Groups policy is that gross debt should not exceed $300 million and that the leverage ratio of gross debt clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
In July 2006 the Group entered into a five year $500 million revolving credit facility the Facility.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA the Group was obliged to repay and cancel the Facility which it duly did on 12 April 2007.
Accordingly, drawings on the Facility as at 31 December 2007 were $nil 2006: $12 million.
Details of the Groups dividend policy is disclosed on page 43 of this Annual Report under the heading Review of 2007.
PartyGaming Plc Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
Amounts due from PSPs which are investment grade banks are classified as cash equivalents and not trade receivables.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their balance sheet, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.
The internal rating system was introduced in April 2007 and accordingly there are no comparatives.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis by the Director of Payment Processing.
Financial An internal rating of 1 is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of 5 is assessed as weak.
This table does not include statements amounts due from PSPs that are investment grade banks which are classified as cash equivalents rather than 158 trade receivables.
1 Very Total Strong 2 Strong 3 Good 4 Adequate 5 Weak At 31 December 2007 $million $million $million $million $million $million Payment Service Providers amounts due 29.7 1.3 19.8 8.2 0.4 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or at least better quality, PSPs.
The table below sets out the movement in the impairment of payment processor receivables.

Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with banks that do not meet this credit rating in Israel, Bulgaria and India to meet local salaries and expenses.
These balances are kept to a minimum and typically do not exceed $3m at any time during the monthly payments cycle.

Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk Given the Groups net cash position, the Group considers that its exposure to interest rate risk is negligible.
The Groups current net cash position is maintained on a fully floating basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.
Currency risk Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some or all of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cashflows are hedged.
The Group also economically hedges material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a weekly basis.
A $5 million currency tolerance limit between US dollars and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than US dollars to hedge non-US dollar investments up to 50% of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of on-going debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
The Group had no material non-US dollar debt which hedged net investments during the years ended 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and any resultant impact on the Groups income statement of either: an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate interest-bearing financial instruments, or a 10% strengthening or weakening in the US dollar against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the US dollar, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-US currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as a projection of likely future events and losses.

This has resulted in a fundamental change to the currency mix of the client liability and accordingly the sensitivity analysis for currency movements is omitted for the year ending 31 December 2006.
Insurance The Group purchases insurance for commercial or, where required, for legal or contractual reasons.
The Group also retains certain insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.

The Groups subsidiaries continued to provide the following property arrangements during the period: the lease of an unfurnished property to the Group Finance Director at an annual lease rental of 44,400 $84,000, which the Directors believe is the fair rental value of the property.
This property was sold at fair market value of 1.2 million to the Group Finance Director on 25 May 2007: the Chief Executive Officer has two furnished properties available for his use in Gibraltar which the Directors believe have a fair rental value of approximately $150,000 per annum plus service and utility costs : and the Chief Executive Officer has an additional property available for his use at fair rental value.
The Chief Executive Officer has not availed himself of the property and the property has been leased to other employees at fair rental value.
Former Directors and founders have leased their personal properties to employees of the Group.
The Directors believe that these lease arrangements are fair value personal arrangements between the parties involved and are independent of the Group.
The Principal Shareholders have also given certain indemnities to the Group.
On 20 June 2007 Mr Garber gifted 300,000 Shares to the Employee Trust.
There were no conditions applying to this gift but Mr Garber recommended to the Employee Trust that the Shares be awarded to those PartyGaming employees demonstrating an outstanding commitment to helping the Company achieve its objectives in 2007 or who come up with exemplary entrepreneurial ideas for the Companys business.
The enactment of the UIGEA resulted in a prohibitive legislative occurrence, as defined under the terms of the Groups revolving credit facility, which prevented further drawdown until discussions with lenders had determined whether there was a basis for the credit facility to be continued.
Due to the fact that customer redemptions are paid out more quickly than the receipt of customer deposits, it was anticipated that the enactment of the UIGEA might result in a temporary constraint on cashflow.
Therefore, the Company put in place arrangements for a short-term loan facility to be provided by the founders of the Company, should the need arise.
A $50 million facility agreement was executed and placed in escrow, undated, such that if required, the Company could choose immediately to date the document and to drawdown the facility which would be for a term of six months from the drawdown date.
In the event that the loan agreement was taken out of escrow, an arrangement fee of 0.25% of the facility amount would be payable and interest thereon would accrue at the rate of 6% per annum.
The facility remained in escrow until March 2007 and was never utilised.
Related parties continued The Group purchased telecommunication services of $4.7 million from a company on an arms length basis for whom a Board member is a director, with $0.2 million owed to that company at 31 December 2007.
The Group also purchased utilities of $0.3 million from companies on an arms length basis for whom a Board member is a director.
No amounts were owed to these companies at 31 December 2007.
On 1 February 2008, the Group paid the final element of the consideration due to Trident Gaming Plc in respect of the acquisition of the business and assets connected with the Gamebookers.

John OMalia, Chief Games Officer, was the former CEO of Gamebookers and received Euro 2.1 million of the total consideration.
Additionally a loan of $5.8 million due to him at 31 December 2006 was repaid in the year.
Share option arrangements Certain key management and certain Directors were granted nil-cost options under service contracts, which were Financial formally granted under a Group share option plan see note 28. statements Bonita Trust 163 The Bonita Trust was established in Gibraltar in 2004 effectively by the Groups Principal Shareholders to benefit the communities where the Group and its employees and service providers operate.
The Bonita Trust is operated by an independent professional trustee.
The Bonita Trust has philanthropic objectives and supports medical, cultural and educational programmes, principally directed to benefit the communities of Gibraltar, India and the UK.
In addition, employees of PartyGaming and their families are a beneficiary class of The Bonita Trust.
In December 2006 and subsequently, The Bonita Trust made or committed to make payments to certain individuals that were employed or had previously been employed by the Group.
These payments were made independently of the Group and were over and above the amounts that the Board had already determined should be paid by the Group to those employees and former employees.
However, as these payments were based primarily on the Companys share price, the Board considers these to fall under the criteria for Share-based Payments under IFRS 2 and in the year to 31 December 2007 has charged an amount to the income statement totalling $2.2 million 2006: $26.8 million as if such amounts had been paid by the Group itself.
A corresponding amount has been recorded as a capital contribution in the Groups balance sheet.
Of the $2.2 million, $2.0 million 2006: $9.4 million relates to Discontinued operations.
The Group has been informed that during 2007 The Bonita Trust made donations and other payments in respect of its other objectives totalling $1.4 million 2006: $8.4 million.
Disclosure of these payments has been made as it is possible that the Groups name may be linked with them.
It is emphasised that neither The Bonita Trust nor any person or entity connected with The Bonita Trust sought any advice from the Group, its Directors or key management in deciding whether these payments should be made.
In addition, none of the payments were made in respect of any obligations incurred, or services received by the Group, nor did they fall within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
Consequently, no entries have been made to the Groups financial statements in respect of these payments.

Acquisitions made during the period Empire Online Limited EOL On 19 January 2007 the Group acquired assets, players and gaming related contracts associated with EOL, an exclusively non-US facing gaming business.
In consideration for the acquisition, PartyGaming issued 83,325,934 new Shares in PartyGaming with an average price of 29.32p over the 15 days prior to the date of acquisition.
In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the provisional fair value of the net assets of EOL was assessed and reported as a post balance sheet event in the 2006 Annual Report and adjustments from book value have been made where necessary.
In the investigation period since the date of acquisition further adjustments to the fair value of the net assets have been made.
Adjustments have also been made to convert share capital issued using the foreign exchange rate prevailing on the date of acquisition.
These adjustments are summarised as follows: Fair value Financial adjustment Fair value statements as reported as reported Fair value 166 at year at year adjustments ended ended in Final fair Book value 31 December 31 December investigation value to on acquisition 2006 2006 period the Group $million $million $million $ million $million Intangible fixed assets note 11 221.8 202.8 19.0 19.0 Net assets 222.1 202.8 19.3 0.3 19.0 The fair value adjustment relates to the write-off of goodwill and the attributing of fair values of customer lists and brands acquired as part of the acquisition.
