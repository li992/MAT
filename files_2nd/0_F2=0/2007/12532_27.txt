7 Discontinued operations In December 2006 management decided to dispose of the groups Mauritanian operations.
Negotiations with several interested parties subsequently took place.
These operations, which were expected to be sold within 12 months, were classified as a disposal group held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet in the 2006 financial statements.
The 2006 results of the Mauritanian operations were presented in discontinued operations in the groups 2006 income statement.
In October 2007 discussions with a preferred bidder were terminated and a decision was made to retain the groups interests in Mauritania.
As a consequence the financial results for the Mauritanian operations are no longer required to be presented separately from the groups continuing operations in the 2007 income statement and corresponding amounts for 2006 have been re-presented accordingly.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the disposal group classified as held for sale in 2006 were as follows: 2006 $ million Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 16.2 Property, plant and equipment 65.3 Investments in associates 0.1 Trade and other receivables 8.8 Total assets classified as held for sale 90.4 Trade and other payables 5.4 Long-term provisions 7.2 Deferred tax liabilities 1.6 Total liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale 14.2 Net assets of disposal group 76.2 A loss of US$8.1 million arose on the re-categorisation of the Mauritanian assets as a held for sale group, being the difference between the fair values less cost to sell of the disposal group and the carrying values of its net assets.
This has been recognised as an impairment of property, plant and equipment in cost of sales.
