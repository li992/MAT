11 Earnings per share When it was formed on 12 May 2005, the Group used reverse acquisition accounting in accordance with IFRS 3.
Therefore earnings per share is calculated by reference to the share capital of the legal parent rather than the legal subsidiary, whose share capital is disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the Foseco Employee Benefit Trust.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, dilutive potential ordinary shares arising from the vesting of Ltips are taken into account.
The following income and share data is used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for total operations: 2007 2006 m m Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share Profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent 17.8 24.0 Basic earnings per share on year for the period 10.8p 14.3p Diluted earnings per share on year for the period 10.6p 14.2p Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations Profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent 17.8 24.0 Less: Net profit for the year from discontinued operations - 0.1 Profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders from continuing operations 17.8 23.9 Basic earnings per share on profit for the year from continuing operations 10.8p 14.2p Diluted earnings per share on profit for the year from continuing operations 10.6p 14.1p Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items Profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders from continuing operations 17.8 23.9 Add: Exceptional items 9.0 - Profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders from continuing operations before exceptional items 26.8 23.9 Basic earnings per share on profit for the year from continuing operations before exceptional items 16.2p 14.2p Diluted earnings per share on profit for the year from continuing operations before exceptional items 16.0p 14.1p 40
