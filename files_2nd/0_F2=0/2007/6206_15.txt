Issue costs associated with the debt therefore have to be amortised over a shorter period than the original term of the debt.
Early repayment of the debt also causes interest rate swaps which had been entered into on terms and durations matching the debt to become ineffective hedges.
The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps has therefore been charged to the income statement.
See note 29 for events after the balance sheet date.
c The total finance cost for financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss is 7.2 million 2006: 6.3 million.
