C2 Category C2 Russian reserve system reserves are preliminary estimated reserves of a deposit calculated on the basis of geological and geophysical research of unexplored sections of deposits adjoining sections of a field containing reserves of higher categories and of untested deposits of explored fields.
The shape, size, structure, level, reservoir types, content and characteristics of the hydrocarbon deposit are determined in general terms based on the results of the geological and geophysical exploration and information on the more fully explored portions of a deposit.
Category C2 reserves are used to determine the development potential of a field and to plan geological, exploration and production activities.

Proved reserves are those that, based on the available evidence and taking into account technical and economic factors, have a better than 90% chance of being produced.
2P Proved Probable Reserves Probable Reserves Probable reserves are those reserves in which hydrocarbons have been located within the geological structure with a lesser degree of certainty because fewer wells have been drilled and or certain operational tests have not been conducted.
Probable reserves are those reserves that, on the available evidence and taking into account technical and economic factors, have a better than 50% chance of being produced.
3P Proved Probable Possible reserves Possible reserves Possible reserves are those unproven reserves that, on the available evidence and taking into account technical and economic factors, have a 10% chance of being produced.
