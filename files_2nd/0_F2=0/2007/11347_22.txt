2006 m m Profit before taxation from continuing operations 147.8 130.3 Profit before taxation from discontinued operations 16.1 Accounting profit before tax 147.8 146.4 Accounting profit multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax 30% 2006: 30% 44.3 43.9 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.7 0.8 Depreciation in respect of non-qualifying items 0.7 0.9 Non-taxable income 0.8 0.5 Non-taxable profit on disposal of subsidiaries 4.4 Retirement benefits 2.8 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior periods 5.4 0.4 Non-taxable amortisation of financing items 2.3 3.9 Other 0.6 Total tax expense reported in the income statement 36.6 40.0 The effective tax rate for the current year was 24.8% 2006: 27.3%.
The reduction of 2.5% is explained by adjustments in respect of prior periods arising from changes in capital allowances claims and a revision to retirement benefits, a reduction in the amortisation of financing items, and the absence of any disposal of subsidiaries in the current year.
d Unrecognised tax losses The Group has tax losses of 9.1 million 2006: 10.8 million which have arisen in its Gibraltar subsidiary for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and it is not expected that the subsidiary will utilise significant amounts in the foreseeable future.
The losses are, however, available for offset against future taxable profits without time limit.
e Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 March 2007, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2006: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 7.2 million 2006: 7.0 million.

The annual excess was already expected to reduce because tax deductions for deferred revenue expenditure are now claimed on a depreciation basis as set out in HM Revenue and Customs Tax Bulletin 53 but the timing of future capital allowances claims is subject to proposals announced by the UK Government on 21 March 2007 to revise the rates of allowances with effect from 1 April 2008.
A reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% has also been proposed with effect from the same date.
The proposed changes to capital allowances that are expected to affect the Group are a reduction in the rate of allowances for items of general plant and machinery from 25% to 20% per annum: an increase in the rate of allowances for long life assets from 6% to 10% per annum: the phased abolition of industrial building allowances by 31 March 2011: and the introduction of a new allowance rate of 10% per annum for building-related fixtures the definition of which is to be the subject of consultation.
The 2007 Finance Bill includes proposals for the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% as well as for the removal of potential balancing adjustments in respect of assets on which industrial buildings allowances are being claimed.
These changes had not been enacted or substantively enacted by the date of these financial statements.
In the directors view, had the above changes been enacted, the Groups deferred tax liability at 31 March 2007 would have been increased by approximately 74 million.
