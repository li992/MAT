Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Significant accounting policies AMEC plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Statement of compliance The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc AMEC and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year, and the groups share of the profit after interest and tax, and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU as at 31 December 2007 adopted IFRS.
The consolidated accounts of the group have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP : these are presented on pages 115 to 120.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosure was adopted during the year.
As the standard is concerned only with disclosure, its adoption had no impact on either the balance sheet or income statement.
During 2006 IFRIC 12 on service concession arrangements was issued.
This interpretation is effective from 1 January 2008, but has yet to be adopted for use in the EU.
In view of this, the directors consider that it remains appropriate to apply the approach set out in Application Note F of the UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in determining the accounting model to be applied to AMECs PPP activities.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed.
The directors do not expect this accounting policy to be significantly different to that under IFRIC 12.
During 2007 IFRIC 14 on defined benefit pension scheme assets was issued.
In view of this it has not been applied by the group in the consolidated accounts.
On adoption this is not expected to have an impact on the groups consolidated accounts as, following a review of the basis of recoverability, the surplus has been recognised net of deferred tax on the balance sheet in 2007.
During 2006 IFRIC 11 on group and treasury share transactions was issued.
This interpretation is effective for the groups 2008 accounts and is not expected to have a material impact on the groups consolidated accounts.
During 2006 IFRS 8 on segment reporting was issued and is effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 will require disclosure of segment information based on internal management information.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated accounts.
Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and retirement benefit assets and liabilities are stated at fair value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 Employee benefits, for long-term contracts under IAS 11 Construction contracts and for provisions under IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity that underpin their valuations.
A significant amount of the groups activities are undertaken via long-term contracts.
These contracts are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11 which requires estimates to be made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and revenues on the latest available information, which includes detailed contract valuations.
In many cases the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual obligations which span more than one reporting period.
Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events and often need to be revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved.
The estimates of contract costs and revenues are updated regularly and significant changes are highlighted through established internal review procedures.
In particular, the internal reviews focus on the timing and recognition of incentive payments and the age and recoverability of any unagreed income from variations to the contract scope or claims.
The impact of the changes in accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
When accounting for provisions for litigation and other items the group has taken internal and external advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the group.
It carefully assesses the likelihood of success of a claim or action.
Appropriate provisions are made for legal claims or actions against the group on the basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for those which in the view of management are unlikely to succeed.

indd 82 31 3 08 21:57:43 1 Significant accounting policies continued Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under the contract.
AMEC manages these risks by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with counterparties up to a pre-approved limit.
These limits are set at prudent levels by the board, are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch and have been reviewed in light of the recent market turbulence.
The boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The group has remained in a net cash position throughout the year.
This position is considered temporary as the group intends to invest in the businesses and may continue the share buy back programme, for up to 80 million, on an opportunistic basis.
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax results of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement, with the 2006 consolidated income statement and notes 2 to 9 being restated for the same presentation.
The results and other disclosures in respect of discontinued operations are shown in note 9.
The non-core Built Environment businesses were sold during the year and are treated as discontinued operations in 2007.
Other discontinued operations include pipeline construction businesses which were sold during 2006 and 2007, and AMEC SPIE, which was sold in 2006.
The cash flows are fully consolidated within AMEC up to the date of sale and the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that have not been sold at the year end are shown separately on the consolidated balance sheet.
In accordance with IFRS 5, the consolidated balance sheet has not been restated to exclude discontinued operations.
The consolidated cash flow has not been restated to exclude discontinued operations.
Basis of consolidation A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC.
Control is achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities AMEC has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
An associate is an entity in which AMEC has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated accounts include the groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis.
The results of joint venture entities and associates are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that joint control or significant influence commences until the date that it ceases.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised only to the extent of the groups interest in the joint venture or associate, unless the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it incurs and its share of the income measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
Bid costs Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is appointed as the preferred bidder.
Subsequent to appointment as preferred bidder, bid costs are capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected to generate sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the bid costs.
Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are applied first against the balance of costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional amounts treated as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill The purchase method is used to account for all business combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of AMECs cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Construction and other long-term contracts As soon as the outcome of a construction or other long-term contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable, and contract costs are expensed as incurred.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Revenue in respect of variations to the contract scope and claims is recognised when it is probable that it will be received and is capable of being reliably measured.
Incentive payments are recognised when a contract is sufficiently far advanced that it is probable that the required conditions will be met and the amount of the payment can be reliably measured.
The gross amounts due from customers under construction and other long-term contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, less provision for recognised losses and progress billings.
These amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due from customers are included in trade and other payables.

indd 83 31 3 08 21:57:43 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations that has either been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale or is part of a plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area.
An operation is classified as a discontinued operation when the above criteria are met, and the comparative income statement is restated to show the operation as discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
Thereafter generally the assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, and retirement benefit assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the year in which they arise.
The pension surplus has been presented net of deferred tax in the 2007 balance sheet following a review of the basis of recoverability.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by reference to market values for similar financial instruments or by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The sale and purchase of derivative financial instruments are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, any gain or loss on the effective part of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the hedging reserve remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised.
In other cases the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at amortised cost and any gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When hedge accounting ceases, any adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item as a consequence of the fair value hedge relationship, is recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Trading results are translated at average rates for the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of trading results and monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken to a translation reserve.
They are recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal or closure of a business.
The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to adopted IFRS.

indd 84 31 3 08 21:57:43 1 Significant accounting policies continued Impairment The carrying values of all of the groups assets other than inventories, balances on construction contracts and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying value then the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
For goodwill and assets not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Intangible assets other than goodwill Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include software, customer relationships, trademarks and order backlogs are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is fair value at date of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated lives of intangible assets held at 31 December 2007 are as follows: Software Three to five years Customer relationships Three to ten years Tradenames Five years Inventories Inventories, including land held for and in the course of development, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Development land and work in progress is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing of the development.
Cost includes cost of acquisition and development to date, including directly attributable fees and expenses net of rental and other income attributable to the development.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Net financing income costs Net financing income costs comprise interest receivable on funds invested, interest payable and foreign exchange gains and losses.
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment, until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
The only material projects where this has occurred are those held in the groups investments in joint ventures which are involved in PPP projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual assets.
The estimated lives used are: Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment Mainly three to five years Provisions for litigation and other items The group has taken internal and external advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the group.
Appropriate provisions are made for legal claims or actions against the group on the basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for those, which in the view of management are unlikely to succeed.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied to external customers.
It includes the groups share of revenue from work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract, as set out in the accounting policy for construction and other long-term contracts.
Revenue from developments activities is recognised on completion of a signed sale agreement after all material conditions have been met.
Share-based payments There are share-based payment arrangements which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares: these awards are granted by AMEC.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due to share prices or total shareholder return not achieving the threshold for vesting.

indd 85 31 3 08 21:57:44 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using statutory tax rates, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recognised in the accounts and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
2 Segmental analysis of continuing operations Class of business As the groups management and internal reporting are structured by class of business, this is the basis for the groups primary segment reporting.
The non-core Built Environment businesses are treated as discontinued operations in 2007.
Other discontinued activities include pipeline construction and AMEC SPIE.
The segmental results for the year ended 31 December 2006 have been restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment and some minor business restructuring.
These restated results are consistent with those disclosed on 25 June 2007, except for a change in classification of the Wind Developments business.
This has been transferred out of the power and process division and into the investments and other activities segment.
The business and financial review is based on the reported results before joint venture tax, intangible amortisation and pre-tax exceptional items, but including joint venture profit before tax.
The results as presented in the business and financial review are reconciled to those presented in this note in the tables on pages 51 to 53.
The segmental analysis of discontinued operations is shown in note 9.

These are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the groups activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net financing income costs cannot be analysed segmentally.

14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees.
Substantially all UK members are in funded defined benefit schemes, the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuations of the two major UK schemes as at 31 December 2004 and 1 April 2005, and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2007.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 2007 2006 Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.7 5.1 Rate of inflation 3.2 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2 3.0 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 8.1 7.7 Bonds 5.7 4.4 Property 6.6 6.2 Other 5.5 4.5 For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows: Male Female years years Member aged 60 current life expectancy 23.8 26.8 Member aged 40 life expectancy at 60 25.0 27.8 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.
Since the year-end, equity markets have fallen.
The board estimates that as at 31 January 2008, this would have resulted in the pre-tax surplus of the schemes declining by c. 50 million under an IAS 19 valuation.
Recent guidance from the Pensions Regulator regarding longevity statistics suggests that further strengthening of mortality assumptions may be appropriate, and specifically alludes to the adoption of the long-cohort rate of improvement as a benchmark for occupational scheme mortality going forward.
The mortality experience of the AMEC schemes will be reviewed in detail at the next actuarial valuation, due as at 1 April 2008.
A move to long-cohort assumptions would reduce the current funding surplus pre-tax by c. 60 million or approximately five per cent of liabilities.
Even after taking into account both the recent fall in equity markets and the potential move to long-cohort assumptions, the schemes would remain in a strong position.
The surplus has been presented net of deferred tax on the balance sheet in 2007, following a review of the basis of recoverability.

21 Financial instruments Details of the groups financial risk management objectives and policies, together with its policies for hedging are provided in the business and financial review on pages 56 and 57.
Hedging of interest rate risk The group holds significant net cash balances following the disposal of AMEC SPIE, the Built Environment and other peripheral businesses during 2006 and 2007.
The group intends to reinvest these monies into the core activities and return up to 80 million to shareholders via the previously announced share buy back.
Accordingly, the group has decided not to hedge against longer term interest rate fluctuations.
This policy will be kept under review.
Hedging of foreign currency risk cash flow hedges The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs, in non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2007 2006 2007 2006 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 25.1 10.7 1.6 0.7 Assets classified as held for sale 18.3 1.4 Current liabilities 12.0 80.2 0.9 1.8 37.1 109.2 0.7 0.3 The following tables indicate the periods in which the cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur: 2007 Carrying Expected 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 More than amount cash flows or less months years years 5 years million million million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 1.6 25.1 8.7 7.6 8.8 Liabilities 0.9 12.0 3.9 3.3 3.5 1.3 0.7 37.1 12.6 10.9 12.3 1.3 2006 Carrying Expected 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 More than amount cash flows or less months years years 5 years million million million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 0.7 10.7 5.9 0.9 1.8 2.1 Liabilities 1.8 80.2 47.6 14.5 10.3 7.8 1.1 90.9 53.5 15.4 12.1 9.9 AMEC plc annual report 2007 103 1013 AMEC back 07 CS2.

The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2007 2006 2007 2006 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 69.4 36.4 1.5 0.1 Current liabilities 9.7 9.4 0.3 0.1 79.1 45.8 1.2 Hedging of foreign currency risk net investment hedges The group uses cross currency swaps and, until repayment of substantially all the groups debt during 2006, foreign currency denominated borrowings which have been designated as hedges of the net investments in subsidiaries in Canada, the US and formerly in France.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2007 2006 2007 2006 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 127.5 8.2 Current liabilities 138.3 4.1 A net foreign exchange loss for the year of 8.6 million 2006: gain of 16.4 million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these swaps and borrowings.

It conducts business in a range of currencies, including Canadian and US dollars and currencies linked to the US dollar.
As a result, the group is exposed to foreign exchange risks, which will affect transaction costs and the translation results and value of underlying assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges its material transaction related exposures.
With respect to translation exposure, the group does not hedge the profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but does hedge a proportion of assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the average Sterling Canadian dollar and Sterling US dollar rates on post-tax profit for 2007 is 7.0 million.
The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the closing rates on equity for 2007 is 14.0 million.
Credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
The ageing of trade receivables at the year end was: Gross Gross receiveables Impairment receivables Impairment 2007 2007 2006 2006 million million million million Not past due 188.6 0.5 287.1 0.6 Past due 0-30 days 48.1 43.9 Past due 31-120 days 27.4 1.8 29.5 3.2 Past due 121-365 days 12.1 5.7 12.9 2.6 More than one year 17.4 12.0 28.4 13.7 293.6 20.0 401.8 20.1 The above analysis excludes retentions relating to contracts in progress of 20.9 million 2006: 41.6 million expected to be recovered within one year and 6.5 million 2006: 10.6 million expected to be recovered after one year.
Net receivables as at 31 December 2007 include 5.4 million in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year.
The group believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2007 2006 million million As at 1 January 20.1 49.7 Disposal of businesses 2.6 22.0 Addition reduction in impairment allowance 2.5 7.6 As at 31 December 20.0 20.1 Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The groups most significant customer is Shell, which in 2007 accounted for around 10 per cent of continuing revenues.
The group holds significant net cash balances following the disposal of AMEC SPIE, the Built Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses during 2006 and 2007.
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under the contract.
Credit ratings are monitored continuously by group treasury.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
Bank loans and bonds are valued based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.

Share-based payments Offers are made periodically in certain countries under the UK and International Savings Related Share Option Schemes which are open to all employees in those countries who meet minimum service criteria.
Grants of share options are made to participating employees that entitle them to buy shares in the company normally after three years at up to 20 per cent discount to the market price of the shares at the time of offer.
In the USA, to conform with the relevant tax rules, options are granted at a maximum discount of 15% to the share price at the time of grant and are normally exercisable after 2 years.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, directors and selected senior employees have been granted share options with a maximum term of ten years that are subject to a non-market based performance condition.
No awards have been made under this scheme since 2004.
The ongoing executive long-term incentive scheme is the Performance Share Plan 2002.
Annual awards are made to directors and selected senior employees of restricted shares that are subject to both market and non-market based conditions calculated over a three-year period.
Detailed terms of this plan are included in the remuneration report on pages 73 and 74.
All of the share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are equity-settled and, other than in defined good leaver circumstances, require participants to be still in employment with the group at the time of vesting.

Cade-Idepe is one of the largest independent Chilean engineering services companies and is based in Santiago.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Cade-Idepe were as follows: Fair value Recognised Book value adjustments value million million million Property, plant and equipment 0.8 0.8 Intangible assets 1.5 1.5 Trade and other receivables 6.5 6.5 Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 0.3 Trade and other payables 3.1 3.1 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 4.5 1.5 6.0 Goodwill on acquisition 6.6 12.6 Consideration Cash of which 2.5 million is deferred 12.3 Cost of acquisition 0.3 12.6 As Cade-Idepe was acquired on 3 October 2007, its contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2007 were not material to the results of the group.
The revenue and profit for the year ending 31 December 2007 for Cade-Idepe were not material to the group.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Cade-Idepe primarily because of synergies obtained through combining Cade-Idepes specialist engineering expertise and strong customer relationships with AMECs project management and engineering skills.
A number of other immaterial acquisitions were made in the year ended 31 December 2007 for 3.1 million 2006: 5.5 million in cash with the assumption of cash of 0.2 million 2006: overdraft of 9.5 million.
The aggregate fair value of the identifiable net liabilities was 1.1 million 2006: 2.6 million excluding overdrafts assumed and the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 1.8 million 2006: 17.6 million.
There was no difference between book value and fair value to the group of the assets and liabilities acquired.

indd 110 31 3 08 21:59:22 25 Acquisitions and disposals continued The contributions of the acquired businesses to revenue and profit were not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets at the dates of recognition.
All acquisitions in the year have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The acquisition cost of joint ventures and other investments amounted to 6.0 million 2006: 23.5 million and principally related to investments in public private partnership projects and development projects.
Disposals During 2007, the group sold its non-core Built Environment businesses, which are treated as discontinued operations in 2007 as follows: On 27 July 2007, the divestment of the Property Developments and UK Building and Civil Engineering businesses to Morgan Sindall plc was completed.
On 14 September 2007, the divestment of the Building and Facilities Services business to SPIE S. A. was completed.
On 12 November 2007, the divestment of the management team and eight underlying PPP assets of the Project Investments business to Land Securities Trillium was completed.
Other non-core businesses divested during the year which are treated as discontinued operations include AMEC SPIE Capag, Buchan Concrete Solutions and Midwest pipelines.

In addition to the cash and cash equivalents of 104.8 million, an amount of 15.1 million previously accounted for as debt was eliminated on disposal.
The net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations during the year were as follows: 2007 2006 million million Net cash flow from operating activities 0.7 18.2 Net cash flow from investing activities 2.3 7.0 Net cash flow from financing activities 24.5 3.0 49.7 AMEC SPIE Rail, Dynamic Structures and Monserco Limited were sold for a cash consideration of 24.6 million during the year, net of costs of 1.3 million together with cash sold of 3.1 million, resulting in a profit on disposal of 17.7 million.
These businesses were treated as continuing operations.
Further proceeds of 3.1 million were received, primarily in respect of the repayment of loans by joint venture entities.

None of the leases includes any contingent rentals.
28 Contingent liabilities Guarantees and indemnities The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC.
In the normal course of business, the company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued on behalf of group companies and parental guarantees have been given in support of the contractual obligations of group companies, joint ventures and associates on both a joint and a several basis.
As at 31 December 2007, AMEC has given performance guarantees in respect of Incheon Bridge Company Ltds overhead costs during the construction phase and has an obligation to subscribe for additional equity up to 8.1 million in certain circumstances.
Construction completion is expected to be achieved in late 2009 and no obligations under either of these undertakings are expected to arise.
There is a separate commitment to invest equity in the Incheon Bridge Company see note 13.

indd 112 31 3 08 21:59:23 28 Contingent liabilities continued Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
Provisions of 71.5 million 2006: 85.3 million are shown in note 22 in respect of these claims.
It is not practicable to quantify the remaining contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
The information below indicates the quantum of claims against AMEC or where we are unable to quantify the claim, an indication of the gross contract value or the amount in dispute.
As the list below involves actions by third parties against AMEC, the timing of settlement cannot be determined although AMEC is endeavouring to settle as soon as practicable.
Due to the litigation, there is no work in progress or other receivable recognised in respect of these contracts.
Whilst AMEC believes that certain claims may be covered by insurance, it is not currently practicable to assess the extent to which AMECs insurance policies will respond in the event of a settlement.
During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, entered into various contracts with the United States General Services Administration GSA for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a US Customs House in California.
The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the order of US$290 million.
Due, inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete.
ACMI contested the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims on this contract.
The GSA submitted its claim against ACMI for reprocurement and other costs totalling US$32 million.
During 2007 the GSA revised and reduced its claim for reprocurement costs to US$17.3 million.
The United States Department of Justice filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two federal felonies and paid two fines totalling approximately US$1.2 million.
AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC in the US and thus, the US Government.
The GSA subsequently filed a motion for summary judgement seeking an order declaring that ACMI had forfeited its claims on all the projects.
ACMI opposed the motion and oral argument was held in February 2004.
During 2005, the US Court of Federal Claims ruled that ACMI had violated the US Anti-Kickback Act.
The Court stated that it intended to issue an order in respect of the Governments counter claims and the issues relating to the Anti-Kickback Act in April 2006.
The court ruled in January 2007 that ACMI claims must be forfeited and damages in respect of false claims and Anti-Kickback legislation would be payable.
Several hearings have taken place in the US Court of Federal Claims and fines damages of US$7.3 million sought by the GSA are likely to be granted by the court.
The US Government has applied for a motion to seize funds relating to another ACMI project.
US$8.0 million in funds owed to ACMI have been frozen by the courts, and could remain frozen whilst the above judgement is appealed.
Other matters the principal outstanding issue is GSAs claim for reprocurement costs of US$17.3 million remain to be heard by the US Court of Federal Claims.
The developments in 2007 have been fully reflected in the provisions held in respect of the Courthouses and Customs House in California.
In 2000, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$115 million to design and build a jail for the City and County of San Francisco CCSF.
Due to unforeseen conditions, delays and interference with ACMIs design, procurement and execution of the work, ACMI suffered large cost overruns.
In 2005, lawsuits were filed by both parties.
CCSF further alleged that ACMI made false claims in connection with the project and also failed to properly maintain its California contractors license throughout the project term.
Extensive discovery has been conducted and dispositive motions were filed.
A mediation was conducted, with sessions in the autumn of 2006 and the spring of 2007, and tentative terms of agreement were reached.
In view of the progress toward settlement, the Court vacated the November 2007 date it had earlier set for trial.
The parties are presently working together to complete an agreement on all terms.
Informed of CCSFs allegations about ACMIs alleged licensing irregularities, the California Attorney General filed an Accusation in 2007, initiating a separate action against ACMI on behalf of the California State License Board.
ACMI is continuing its efforts to have the licensing irregularities resolved without significant penalty but, if unable to do so, the matter would be submitted to an administrative law judge for a decision.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, ACMI was one of four construction managers hired by the City of New York to carry out the clean up and debris removal work at the World Trade Center site.
The client was responsible for procuring insurance to protect the construction managers and various contractors from lawsuits arising out of the work.
The World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company the WTC Captive was formed and was funded with US$1 billion in Federal money to provide coverage for the City, the construction managers and the contractors who performed the work on site.
Pursuant to the insurance policy that was issued, the WTC Captive is providing a minimum of US$1 billion in insurance coverage.
This amount can increase depending upon investment returns on the US$1 billion.
The WTC Captive is providing a defence and indemnification for claims against ACMI arising out of this work.
AMEC Group Limited AGL is currently the subject of certain ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in respect of: i separate incidents involving fatalities of subcontractors, namely: two separate fatalities to subcontractors at the Leftbank Apartments project in Manchester in April 2004 and April 2005: and ii a fatal accident on the Clipper platform in the North Sea and iii AGLs role in the management of its subcontractors following an incident in which a crane overturned on an AGL site in Manchester in 2007.
If AGL is to be prosecuted in the Crown Court for any of these cases, it could be liable to unlimited fines.
A prosecution for AGL in relation to fatal accidents in relatively quick succession such as those at the Leftbank Apartments could have an impact on the amount of any penalty.
