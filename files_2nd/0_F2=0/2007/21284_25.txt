Following the European Court of Justice decision in respect of the JP Morgan Claverhouse VAT case, HMRC accepted that the service of managing Investment Trust Companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged liability to pay claims.
Based on this, some of the VAT suffered by the Company in the period 1 October 2000 to date has been written back in accordance with an agreement reached between the Manager and the Company.
The write back has been allocated between revenue return and capital return based on how the amounts were charged in previous years.
