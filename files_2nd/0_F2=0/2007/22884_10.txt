New Accounting Standards IAS 8 requires disclosure of any impending change in accounting policy when an entity has yet to implement a new Standard or Interpretation that has been issued but not yet come into effect.
In addition, it requires disclosure of known or reasonably estimable information relevant to assessing the possible impact that application of the new Standard or Interpretation will have on the entitys financial statements in the period of initial application.
The Company has adopted IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRS 7 requires new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not affect the classification and valuation of the Companys financial instruments.
The standard focuses on the Companys exposure to risks arising from its financial instruments and on its capital risk and financial risk management.
IFRS 7 supersedes the disclosure requirements of IAS 32.
The following new Standards have been issued but are not effective for 2007 and have not been early adopted: In November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 Operating Segments which becomes effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.

Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in Pounds Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency, rounded to the nearest Pound Sterling.
They are prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments.
Other financial assets and financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements: c Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Income distributions from investment funds are recognised in the income statement as dividend income when declared.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss i Classification The Company has designated all of its investments as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
This category comprises: Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition these include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes which may be sold and represent a group of financial assets which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entitys key management personnel.
These are principally investments in unlisted hedge funds.
Financial instruments held for trading these include forward foreign currency contracts.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include balances due from brokers and accounts receivable.
Financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include balances due to brokers and accounts payable.
The table in Note 3 details the categories of financial assets and liabilities held by the Company at the reporting date.
24 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued 2 e Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss continued ii Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities on the date it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A regular way purchase and sale of financial instruments is recognised using trade date accounting.
From this date any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities are recorded.
iii Measurement Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value transaction price plus, in case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
Transaction costs on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately, while on other financial instruments they are amortised.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less impairment losses, if any.
Financial liabilities, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
iv Fair value measurement principles Investments in underlying funds which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange or other trading facility will be valued at the net asset values provided by such entities or their administrators.
These values may be unaudited or may themselves be estimates.
In addition, these entities or their administrators may not provide values at all or in a timely manner and, to the extent that values are not available, those investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser using valuation techniques appropriate to those investments.
Open forward foreign currency contracts at the balance sheet date are valued at forward currency rates at that point.
The unrealised appreciation or depreciation on open forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to the difference between the contracted rate and the rate to close out the contract.
v Realised and unrealised gains and losses Realised gains and losses arising on disposal of investments are calculated by reference to the proceeds received on disposal and the average cost attributable to those investments, and are recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised gains on investments are recognised in the income statement.
vi Impairment Financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the write-down, the write-down is reversed through the income statement.
25 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued 2 e Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss continued vii Derecognition The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
The Company uses First in First out method to determine the gain or loss on derecognition.
f Foreign currency transactions The financial statements of the Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates its functional currency.
The Directors have considered the primary economic currency of the Company and considered the currency in which the original capital was raised, distributions are to be made and ultimately the currency capital would be returned on a break up basis.
The Directors have also considered the currency to which the underlying investments are exposed.
On balance, the Directors believe that pounds Sterling best represents the functional currency.
For the purpose of the financial statements the results and financial position of the Company are expressed in Sterling which is the presentation currency of the Company.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling of the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised gains or losses on currency translation are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency differences relating to investments at fair value through profit or loss are included in gains and losses on investments note 3. g Distribution policy The Directors do not expect income net of expenses to be significant and do not currently expect to declare any dividends.
In the event that future net income is significant, the Directors may consider the distribution of net income in the form of dividends.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents, which include bank overdrafts, are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
Cash, deposits with banks and bank overdrafts are stated at their principal amount.
i Issue expenses Expenses associated with the issue of C Shares are borne exclusively by the shareholders of C shares.
These expenses, when incurred, are written off against share premium.
During the year, issue expenses associated with the issue of C Shares amounted to approximately 8.1 million.
j Changes in accounting policies During the year, the Company elected to adopt IFRS and as a result, these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Comparative information has been adjusted in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to ensure the appropriate accounting policies are applied within each period.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, it is noted that there were no material differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements prepared under IFRS and the amounts reported in the financial statements presented under previous GAAP UK GAAP.

Financial Risk Management The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in an actively managed portfolio of hedge funds, diversified by investment strategy, style and manager, in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, with little correlation to equity and fixed interest benchmarks.
The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Companys Investment Adviser to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.
The Companys financial instruments include cash and currency hedging.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to moderate certain risk exposures.
a Market price risk management Market risk embodies the potential for both loss and gains and includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss that might be suffered through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Adviser in pursuance of its investment objective and policy.
28 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4.
Financial Risk Management continued Adherence to the Companys investment restrictions set out on page 12 in the Directors Report mitigates the risk of excessive exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed in summary form in the Managers Report.
Details of the nature and terms of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date are set out in note 12.
If the price of the underlying hedge funds increased decreased by 5% the net asset value of the Company would increase decrease by 69,061,115 2006: 41,187,926. b Interest rate risk management Substantially all of the Companys assets are non-interest bearing investments and its exposure to interest rate changes is limited.
As a result, the Company is not subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The short term investments included within cash equivalents and bank overdraft have an overnight maturity, and as a result they have a limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The following table details the Companys exposure to interest rate risks.
It includes the Companys assets and liabilities at fair values, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity date measured by the carrying value of the assets and liabilities.

29 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4.
Financial Risk Management continued The Company has a facility agreement with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited for up to the lower of 305 million and 20% of its net assets for short-term or temporary liquidity purposes as may be necessary to facilitate investment and withdrawals from underlying funds or to meet ongoing expenses, and to implement the Companys currency hedging strategy.
Interest on all amounts accrue at a rate of 0.75% per annum above the official rates applicable to the Company from time to time.
The amount drawn down at 31 December 2007 was 108,652,524. Credit facility fees incurred amounted to 319,178.
This facility is secured against the Companys investments.
NonLess than 1-3 interest 1 month months Bearing Total At 31 December 2006 Assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Hedge funds 823,758,522 823,758,522 Derivative financial instruments 993,743 993,743 Loans and receivables Cash equivalents 1,024,502 1,024,502 Other receivables 68,566 955,981 1,024,547 Total assets 1,062,309 825,739,005 826,801,314 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 56,904 56,904 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Bank overdraft 28,961,775 28,961,775 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 6,761,979 6,761,979 Total liabilities 29,018,679 6,761,979 35,780,658 Total interest sensitivity gap 27,956,370 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates as at the reporting date would have decreased the net assets attributable to shareholders and changes in net assets attributable to shareholders by 85,247 2006: 279,564.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal and opposite effect.
c Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risk is generally higher when a non-exchange traded financial instrument is involved because the counterparty for non-exchange traded financial instruments is not backed by an exchange clearing house.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk on the financial assets with its brokers.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
This relates also to financial assets carried at amortised cost, as they have a short-term to maturity.
30 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4.
Financial Risk Management continued At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2007 2006 Financial assets at fair value 1,381,222,302 823,758,522 Cash and cash equivalents 100,194,446 1,024,502 Forward currency contracts 2,129,287 993,743 Balances due from broker 763,054 955,981 Other receivables 748,159 68,566 Total 1,485,057,248 826,801,314 Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved and the high credit quality of the brokers used.
Investments made by the Company and the funds in which it invests may not be regulated by the rules of any stock exchange or investment exchange or other regulatory body or authority.
The counterparties to such investments have no obligation to make markets in such investments.
Furthermore, the Company will be subject to the risk of bankruptcy of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to such investments by, the counterparties with which the Company deals.
The Company monitors the credit rating and financial positions of the brokers used to further mitigate this risk.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by Northern Trust Guernsey Limited.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit quality and financial position of the Custodian.
Substantially all of the cash held by the Company is held by the Custodian and certain other service providers.
Bankruptcy or insolvency by the Custodian and other service providers may cause the Companys rights with respect to the cash held by the Custodian and other service providers to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit rating of the Custodian and other service providers.
If the credit quality or the financial position of the Custodian and other service providers deteriorates significantly the Investment Adviser may move the cash holdings to another bank.
The Companys Investment Adviser analyses credit concentration based on the counterparty of the financial assets that the Company holds.
Details of the Companys ten largest holdings at 31 December 2007 are detailed in the Managers Report on page 9.
The Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk were concentrated in the following industries: 2007 2006 %% Banks 6.75 0.12 Hedge Funds 93.00 99.64 Others 0.25 0.24 Total 100.00 100.00 31 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4.
Financial Risk Management continued d Currency risk The Company may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.
Consequently the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds Sterling.
The Companys operating activities include investing in derivative financial instruments that involve varying degrees of currency risk.
The derivative contracts that the Company holds are forward contracts on foreign currencies for hedging non-sterling share classes and an index option.
Details of forward contracts on foreign currencies and the index options are set out in note 12.
The Companys currency risk is managed on a daily basis by the Investment Adviser in accordance with policies and procedures in place.
The Companys overall currency positions and exposures are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Directors.
The following table sets out the Companys total net exposure to foreign currency risk and the net exposure to foreign currencies of the assets and liabilities: Forward FX Net Assets Liabilities Contracts Exposure At 31 December 2007 Australian dollar 584,241 1,542,555 41,805,957 40,847,643 Euro 1,698,803 4,184,629 160,127,602 157,641,776 US dollar 1,457,478,099 61,600,004 1,245,842,080 150,036,015 At 31 December 2006 Australian dollar 34,459 172,968 29,130,785 28,992,276 Euro 111,463 693,839 95,810,153 95,227,777 US dollar 819,646,951 24,278,813 713,053,098 82,315,040 Amounts in the above table are based on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the underlying principal amount of foreign currency contracts.
At 31 December 2007, had the Sterling strengthened by 5% in relation to the above currencies, with all other variables held constant, net assets attributable to shareholders and the change in net assets attributable to shareholders per the income statement would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2006.
Financial Risk Management continued A 5% weakening of the pound sterling against the above currencies would have resulted in an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
e Liquidity risk management From time to time, the counterparties with which the Company effects transactions might cease making markets or quoting prices in certain of the instruments.
In such instances, the Company might be unable to enter into a desired transaction in currencies or other financial instruments, or to enter into any offsetting transaction with respect to an open position, which might adversely effect its performance.
Similarly, it may not always be possible for the Company to execute a buy or sell order on exchanges at the desired price or to liquidate an open position either due to market conditions or due to the operation of daily price fluctuation limits the maximum fluctuation permitted by some exchanges in the price of a futures or options contract during any trading day.
If trading on an exchange is suspended or restricted, the Company may not be able to execute trades or close out positions on terms which the Investment Adviser believes are desirable.
The Investment Adviser manages liquidity risk in accordance with the Companys investment restrictions, its committed facilities that include provision for settlement timing mismatches and also has access to the Custodian position reports by an on-line system.
Upon raising fresh capital, the Manager seeks to arrange increased facilities as required.
On a quarterly basis the Board reviews and considers the overall liquidity risk of the portfolio.
The Company has a combined overdraft and foreign exchange facility with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited of up to a maximum of 305 million or 20% of Net Value of Assets in custody whichever is the lower.
The facility may be used for purposes that include funding share repurchases and redemptions.
