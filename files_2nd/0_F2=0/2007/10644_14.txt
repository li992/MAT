Following consultation with members of the non-public sector sections of the schemes, the pension ultimately payable to an individual will be based on his or her average earnings, calculated over the period of pensionable service career average revalued earnings or CARE rather than his or her salary in the period immediately preceding retirement final salary.
The averaging of salary described above will take place only for future periods of service.
The pension built up to 31 July 2007 will be calculated on final pensionable salary at that date and will increase in line with inflation, capped at 5% per annum, up to retirement date.
As a result of this change the retirement benefit obligation has been reduced by 18,190,000 net of costs.
The Group treats the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations as exceptional costs.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all dilutive share options in issue and shares under Save As You Earn schemes.
The share price used to calculate diluted earnings per share is based on a weighted average price of 407.05p 31 July 2006: 306.98p.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated after adding back shares held by the employee share trusts to the weighted average number of shares.

A segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2007 2006 Government Regulated Government Regulated Highways Services Industries Total Highways Services Industries Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 United Kingdom 18,176 7,013 23,502 48,691 4,973 577 17,019 22,569 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the management for the following financial year.
Cash flows beyond this point are extrapolated using estimated growth rates stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average for the business in which the CGU operates.
The key assumptions used for value in use calculations are as follows: Government Regulated Highways Services Industries %%% Budgeted net margin 7.0 9.0 6.0 Growth rate for the first five years 5.0 5.0 5.0 Long-term average growth rate 2.3 2.3 2.3 Discount rate 8.0 8.0 8.0 These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within the business segment.
Management determined budgeted net margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
The remaining intangible assets are acquired.

Customer relationships brought forward have a useful life of 15 years, of which approximately 13 remain.
The customer relationships acquired in the year have a useful life of 10 years.
The value of these relationships were arrived at by discounting attributable future cash flows.
A discount rate of between 11% and 12% was used as appropriate, based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired entity.
A customer attrition rate of 10% was assumed in all cases.
Software costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
All amortisation charges in the year have been charged through administrative expenses.
Other intangibles comprise non-compete agreements, specialist software acquired and a license for the Contractors Assurance Case CAC which enables us to work on UK railways.
The software was valued on a replacement cost basis and is amortised over five years.
The value of the noncompete agreements were calculated using discounted cash flows on two base cases, one assuming employees did compete and comparing that with the values obtained if employees did not compete.
Their useful lives are between two and three years: the same as the length that the non-compete agreement is enforceable for.
The CAC was valued on a replacement case basis.
Once granted, this licence does not need to be renewed and therefore has an indefinite life.

22 Financial instruments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk in varying degrees but all have low levels of risk.
For this reason the Group has not undertaken hedging or complex financial instruments to mitigate risks.
Details of the Groups financial risk management objectives and policies are provided in note 1u.
The financial instruments of the Group comprise internal cash resources and debtors and creditors arising from normal trading activities.
The Groups policy is to manage the financial instruments centrally to provide both the working capital and the investment funds necessary for ongoing operations and future development.
The majority of UK projects and contracts are in sterling, and otherwise are in line with the currencies in which the majority of the costs are denominated.
The Groups principal overseas subsidiaries have arranged working capital facilities in their local currency and it is unusual for them to contract in currencies other than their own functional currency.
Consideration is given to hedging against possible currency movements where considered appropriate.
It is the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for and did not identify any.

33 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates several occupational pension schemes for its employees.
These schemes are a combination of defined benefit, defined contribution and third-party defined benefit schemes.
The Mouchel Parkman Superannuation Fund and the Mouchel Parkman Staff Pension Scheme are both funded defined benefit schemes, the Legal and General GPP scheme, Parkman DC Scheme and the Parkman Ireland Pension Scheme DC section are defined contribution schemes and the Group is a member of the Merseyside pension fund, a third-party defined benefit scheme.
a Defined benefit pension schemes third-party schemes 2020 Liverpool and 2020 Knowsley employees are members of the Merseyside Pension Fund, a pre-funded defined benefit scheme.
The Group accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.
b Defined benefit pension schemes Group schemes For the two principal defined benefit schemes, the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate, trustee-administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
In line with normal business practice these valuations are undertaken on a triennial basis.

Given the membership of the two schemes, under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
However, following agreement with most members in the non-public sector sections of the schemes to move from a final salary arrangement to a career average revalued earnings CARE basis for the calculation of their pension benefits see note 3, the deficit has been reduced by 18.5 million.
The date of the most recent full actuarial valuations of the two schemes was March 2004.
