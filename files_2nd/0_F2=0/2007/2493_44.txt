The final dividend which has been declared for the year ended 31 December 2007 is shown on page 108 in note 8 and will be recognised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
In 2006, for the first time, the Company needed to file interim accounts which were prepared to recognise additional dividend income in 2006.
As a result of the Company not doing so, the interim dividend of 323 million paid on 13 September 2006 did not comply with the technical requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The appropriation of distributable profits to the payment of the interim dividend was ratified by shareholders by way of special resolution at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been presented in these Financial Statements.
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 was 3,517 million 2006: 1,809 million.

However, as a result of the technical infringement of the Companies Act 1985, the repurchase and cancellation of these shares was invalid and, accordingly, their nominal value is included within the Companys allotted, called up and fully paid share capital as at 31 December 2006 shown above.
These shares were repurchased on 1 March 2007 from the holders, the Companys brokers, at the same prices agreed between 22 September 2006 and 4 December 2006.
Consequently, the above table for the year ended 31 December 2006 includes 28 million shares purchased for cancellation at a cost of 400 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2007, 45 million shares were also purchased at a cost of 750 million, of which 7 million shares at a cost of 123 million are held in treasury, the remainder being cancelled.
The above table for the year ended 31 December 2007 therefore includes 45 million shares purchased for cancellation, at a cost of 727 million.
Share premium The increase of 5 million relates solely to ordinary shares issued under the Companys share option schemes.
These schemes are described in the Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 75.
