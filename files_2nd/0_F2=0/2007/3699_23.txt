Notes to the Group financial statements 1. Business and geographical segments Business segments During the year, the Group reviewed the organisation of its businesses and having considered the respective risks and rewards, determined that in order to present more reliable and relevant information regarding the segmentation of its results, a consolidation based on four operating divisions was more appropriate than that based on the six divisions previously presented.
The new divisions are the basis on which primary segmental information is reported.
The principal activities of the Groups operating divisions are: Cobham Avionics & Surveillance Providing a suite of end-to-end avionics products, law enforcement and national security solutions, and satellite communication equipment for land, sea and air applications.
Cobham Defence Electronic Systems Critical technology for network centric operations, moving information around the digital battlefield, with customised and off-the-shelf solutions for people and systems to communicate on land, sea and air.
Cobham Mission Systems Providing safety and survival systems for extreme environments, nose-to-tail refuelling systems and wing-tip to wing-tip mission systems for fast jets, transport aircraft and rotor craft.
Cobham Aviation Services Delivering outsourced aviation services for military and civil customers worldwide through military training, special mission flight operations, outsourced commercial aviation and aircraft engineering.
Other Activities include head office net of recoveries, the central project costs relating to the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project and the pre-disposal results of the composites and countermeasures operations disposed of during 2006.
Details for these primary segments are shown below.
As required by IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, comparatives have been restated following the divisional reorganisation.

Income tax expense m Note 2007 2006 Current tax 44.0 44.2 Deferred tax 23 3.3 6.6 Total tax charge for the year 47.3 50.8 In 2006, the tax charge included a 0.3m charge to current tax and a 0.2m credit to deferred tax in respect of discontinued operations.
The total income tax expense is analysed between UK and overseas tax as follows: m 2007 2006 United Kingdom 20.4 33.7 Overseas 26.9 17.1 Total tax charge for the year 47.3 50.8 Tax charge included in share of post-tax results of joint ventures 1.7 1.4 Income tax for the UK is calculated at the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 30% 2006: 30% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: m 2007 2006 Profit before tax: continuing operations 173.5 185.2 discontinued operations 5.8 13.9 179.3 199.1 Tax at the domestic income tax rate of 30.0% 2006: 30.0% 53.8 59.7 Tax effect of share of results of joint ventures 1.7 1.4 Profit on disposals and other income not subject to tax 1.8 5.8 Effect of differences in overseas taxation rates 3.7 3.5 Expenditure qualifying for additional R&D tax deduction 3.1 2.3 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years 3.0 3.1 Impact of change in UK tax rate and other items 0.6 0.2 Total tax charge for the year 47.3 50.8 In addition to the income tax expense charged to the income statement, a deferred tax credit of 7.3m 2006: 8.4m charge has been recognised in equity in the year as shown in the statement of recognised income and expense see also note 23.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK has changed from 30% to 28%, effective from 1 April 2008.
This has reduced deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2007 by 0.7m and will further reduce future UK tax charges.
Dividends The following dividends were authorised and paid during the year: m 2007 2006 Dividends on Ordinary Shares Final dividend of 2.64p per share for 2006 2005: 2.40p 30.0 27.1 Interim dividend of 1.22p per share for 2007 2006: 1.11p 13.8 12.6 43.8 39.7 In addition to the above, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of 3.28 pence per share which will absorb an estimated 37.2m of shareholders funds.
This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
If authorised, it will be paid on 1 July 2008 to shareholders who are on the register of members as at 30 May 2008.
The total dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2007 will therefore be 4.50 pence per share 2006: 3.75 pence.
The total amount paid in respect of 2007 will be 51.0m 2006: 42.6m.

Underlying profit and earnings per share In addition to the information required by IAS 33, Earnings per share, the Directors believe that it is helpful to calculate an underlying earnings per share figure.
Underlying earnings exclude the impacts of the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, fair value adjustments to inventory on acquisition, the marking to market of currency instruments not realised in the period and impairments of goodwill.
There has been no impairment to goodwill in the current or comparative periods.
Underlying earnings also exclude portfolio restructuring costs, which comprise exceptional profits or losses arising on disposals actually completed during the period, as well as exceptional costs or profits associated with the restructuring of the Groups business and property portfolio, and direct costs associated with exceptional terminated acquisitions.

Portfolio restructuring During 2007 the Group undertook a number of restructuring projects.
Consolidation of the diving products business based in Mississauga, Canada, into existing facilities in Iowa, USA and the integration of the antennas business based in Southampton, UK, into the new purpose designed facility in Marlow, UK were both completed.
A project to redevelop the Wimborne, UK, site of Cobham Mission Systems has commenced and will continue in 2008.
In October 2007, 5.8m of contingent consideration was received relating to the sale of the Groups Countermeasures business in 2006.
Consistent with the treatment adopted for this business in 2006, the profit on sale that this represents has been treated as part of discontinued businesses and excluded from the underlying results of the Group.
During 2006, portfolio restructuring activity was focused on the sale and closure of a number of businesses.
Profits from all of these activities have been excluded from trading profit and underlying earnings for the Group.
Restructuring costs and the profit on disposal of continuing activities are included within administrative expenses.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 9.1m 2006: 9.3m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2007 or 2006 for either the defined benefit or defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP, which is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme.
In the USA, the Carleton Technologies defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members from 13 December 2003.
Special contributions of 5.3m were paid in 2007 2006: 5.3m to the CPP as agreed in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which completed in 2005.
In 2006, further special contributions totalling 6.2m were made to the CPP as part of the settlement of the disposals of Wallop Defence Systems Limited and Slingsby Aviation Limited which were completed in 2006.
In addition, a settlement gain of 1.7m was recognised in 2006 as part of the profit on the disposal of Drger Aerospace GmbH, and a curtailment gain of 1.0m was recognised as part of the profit on the disposal of Wallop Defence Systems Limited and Slingsby Aviation Limited.
60 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 10.
Retirement benefit schemes continued Actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries, the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2006.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2007.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
For the purposes of IAS 19, the principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2007 2006 UK USA UK USA Schemes Scheme Schemes Scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 3.80% 3.80% 3.50% 3.50% Discount rate 5.82% 5.82% 5.10% 5.60% Inflation assumption 3.30% 3.30% 3.00% 3.00% Expected return on scheme assets 6.60% 7.06% 6.95% 7.10% Pensions increase unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.30% n a 3.00% n a The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experiences of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality assumption used in 2007 is denoted by actuaries as PA92 year of birth projections medium cohort.
In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life Gender Year of birth Year age 65 expectancy Male 1942 2007 21.9 years Male 1980 2045 23.7 years The mortality assumption used for the CPP at 31 December 2006 was PA92 projected by individual year demonstrated as follows: Further life Gender Year of birth Year age 65 expectancy Male 1940 2005 19.5 years Male 1980 2045 21.7 years At 31 December 2007 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2006: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2006: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2006: 80% of eligible members on retirement.

Details of the schemes which give rise to these charges are as follows: Equity settled share-based payment schemes The Group operates a number of incentive schemes for certain senior executives as follows: The Cobham Performance Share Plan PSP : The Cobham Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP : and The Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares at nil cost which vest 50% based on the Groups three-year Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Groups EPS over the same period.
The PSP was approved at the AGM held on 6 June 2007 and replaces the LTIP scheme.
Under the LTIP scheme awards were made at nil cost, vesting over a three-year performance period based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups EPS growth over the same period.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups ordinary shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups EPS growth over a three-year period.
A new section has been added to the ESOS scheme during 2007 under which options are granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
Further details of these schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 35 to 41.
In addition, entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave is available to all employees of participating subsidiaries.
Employees may purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a twoweek period each year, up to a maximum contribution value of 3,000 in any one year.
The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employees share savings plan and will only be released to employees who remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.

The average share price in that period was 2.036 2006: 1.777.
All awards under the PSP and LTIP schemes have a nil exercise price.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Participants of the PSP scheme receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuation model.
Cash settled share-based payment schemes During 2006, the Group issued share appreciation rights SARs and awards under a phantom LTIP scheme to certain senior executives that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee at the date of exercise.
The expense for the year for these rights is based on the fair value of the outstanding liability at the balance sheet date of 0.4m at 31 December 2007 2006: 0.2m.
SARs are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the rights are granted.
As with the ESOS awards, exercise is conditional upon the Groups EPS growth over a three-year period and is possible between three and 10 years after grant.
Phantom LTIP awards are made at nil cost, vesting over a three-year performance period based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups EPS growth over the same period.
The comparator group and conditions are the same as those which apply for LTIPs, further details of which can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 35 to 41.

Values ascribed to customer lists represent the fair value of acquired customer lists, contracts and other related customer relationships, both contractual and non-contractual, held by the acquired company at time of entry into the Group.
Values ascribed to technology and software represent the fair value of acquired trade secrets and processes, patented and unpatented technology and know how held by the acquired company at time of entry into the Group.
This category also includes the purchase of technology and software rights and licences, where it is appropriate to recognise such items as assets.
Values ascribed to development costs represent the directly attributable costs of internally generated development knowledge from the point at which an individual project meets the requirements for capitalisation until it is available for utilisation in the business.
Values ascribed to other intangible assets represent purchased and acquired patents, licences and trademarks and order backlog.
All of these assets are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Fair values of acquired intangible assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets, discounted at a post-tax rate of 7.6% 2006: 7.5% to present value.

The carrying amount of goodwill arising on acquisitions during 2007 has been allocated as follows: m Total Patriot Antenna Systems Cobham Avionics & Surveillance division 0.5 ADDE Cobham Mission Systems division 1.1 1.6 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The growth rates are based on GDP of the primary market for the CGU, adjusted to recognise an estimate of the historic and projected premium associated with the high technological content associated with the business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the coming year and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth rates as described above.
Where these projections are not appropriate to the prospects of particular businesses, longer-term financial plans have been prepared.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.6% 2006: 10.5%.
Following detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the period and no prior impairment losses reversed.
The goodwill allocated to two CGUs is considered to be individually significant.
REMEC Defense and Space Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, has 42.2m of goodwill allocated to it and no other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Conax Florida Corporation has 43.4m of goodwill and no other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
The recoverable amount associated with this goodwill has been determined on a value in use basis.
Key assumptions are as follows: The authorised plans for the companies which have been extrapolated in perpetuity using a growth rate of 4.8% and discounted to a present value using the Group assumption of 10.6%.
Growth rate is based on US GDP adjusted to reflect a premium for the nature of the CGUs business.
Sensitivity analysis has determined that the discount rate of 10.6% is the most influential assumption on the outcome of the recoverable amount calculation.
The recoverable amount of Remec and Conax exceed the total carrying value of assets for the CGU by 325.6m and 115.0m respectively: the discount rate would need to increase to 19.1% for Remec and 21.6% for Conax in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
The remainder of the goodwill is allocated to various CGUs across the Group, no individual amounts other than those disclosed above are considered individually significant.

The carrying amount of the Groups plant and machinery includes an amount of 0.9m 2006: 0.8m in respect of assets held under finance leases.

Investment properties continued Following reorganisation and consolidation of property utilisation at the Groups research and development facilities in Leatherhead, UK, a portion of the site has been reclassified as investment property.
All of the Groups investment properties are held under freehold interests and are valued under the cost model.
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to 1.3m 2006: 1.0m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the property, save for depreciation.
The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 3 and 25 years, commencing in 1998, 2004 and 2006.
The fair value of the investment properties has been assessed to be 13.8m 2006: 12.1m.
For 2007 this is based on estimated market prices provided by external valuers, Vail Williams LLP, as at 31 December 2007.
For 2006 the fair value was based on estimated market prices provided by the agents who managed the properties on the Groups behalf.
Investments in joint ventures m 2007 2006 Groups share of net assets of joint ventures as below 18.8 15.7 The Group has the following interests in joint ventures within the Aviation Services division: a 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Dfense Service SA, a company incorporated in France.
b 50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England.
c 50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England.
d 50% of the voting share capital in FB Leasing Limited, a company incorporated in England.
Notwithstanding the fact that the holding is 45%, governance structures for Aviation Dfense Service SA are such that the Group has joint control with its partner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.
The share of the balance sheets and income statements of the joint ventures which has been included in the consolidated financial statements is as follows: m 2007 2006 Current assets 25.7 20.3 Non-current assets 39.0 42.7 64.7 63.0 Current liabilities 13.7 12.8 Non-current liabilities 32.2 34.5 45.9 47.3 Net assets 18.8 15.7 Income 35.7 35.2 Expenses 28.0 28.4 18.

During the year 6.3m 2006: 7.1m was provided, 4.3m 2006: 6.6m was utilised and 0.7m 2006: 1.2m of the allowance for obsolescence was reversed.
This allowance is reviewed by the Directors on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary.
The amounts are generally determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand.
Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, consequently, to reversal of amounts previously provided.
8.0m 2006: 0.8m of inventory was also written off directly to the income statement.
Inventory will be realised within the normal operating cycle of the businesses, which in some cases may be more than 12 months.

All trade receivables which are more than 12 months overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Amounts which are less than 12 months overdue are provided where recovery of the balance due is considered to be in doubt.
Movements in the provision for impaired trade receivables during the year are as follows: m 2007 2006 At 1 January 1.8 2.1 Additional provision 0.5 0.5 Utilised 0.5 0.5 Unused amounts reversed 0.6 0.1 Disposed 0.1 Foreign exchange movements 0.1 At 31 December 1.2 1.8 The creation and reversal of the provision for impaired trade receivables have been included in administrative expenses in the income statement.
The total amounts and ageing of impaired trade receivables, against which 1.2m 2006: 1.8m has been provided, are as follows: m 2007 2006 Due at 31 December 0.6 0.5 1 month overdue 0.5 0.2 2 months overdue 0.3 0.2 3 or more months overdue 1.3 1.3 2.7 2.2 72 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 19.

Impairment of trade receivables continued The following trade receivables are past due but not considered to be impaired as there is no recent history of default by these customers: m 2007 2006 Due at 31 December 22.8 19.7 1 month overdue 7.8 6.0 2 months overdue 2.9 3.3 3 or more months overdue 4.1 5.4 37.6 34.4 Based on previous experience, the Group believes that no additional impairment provision is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are not overdue.
The credit quality of the Groups trade receivables is considered by management to be very good as a high proportion of customers are government agencies or large global companies with whom the Group trades on a long-term basis.
This is further evidenced by the low rates of impairments provided and amounts written off.
Information concerning credit risk is shown in note 28.
Other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not include any impaired assets.
Currency analysis The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies: m 2007 2006 Sterling 80.1 54.9 US dollars 106.7 87.1 Australian dollars 13.5 10.1 Euros 40.9 33.6 Other currencies 6.1 6.1 247.3 191.8 20.
Cash and cash equivalents Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents include the following for the purposes of the cash flow statement: m 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents per balance sheet 444.5 364.3 Bank overdrafts 12.5 3.9 Cash and cash equivalents per cash flow statement 432.0 360.4 Cash and cash equivalents include term deposits in Australia of AUS$10.0m 4.4m, 2006: 4.1m and US$1.0m 0.5m, 2006: 0.5m.

Provisions m 2007 2006 Current liabilities 29.5 38.0 Non-current liabilities 30.3 22.9 59.8 60.9 Movements in provisions during the year are as follows: Contract Aircraft Contingent Warranty loss maintenance m consideration claims provisions provisions Other Total At 1 January 2007 14.8 3.8 5.4 7.5 29.4 60.9 Reclassification from accruals 0.3 0.3 1.6 1.6 Additional provisions in the year 3.1 2.7 2.7 2.5 4.0 15.0 Created on closure of operation 0.1 0.1 Utilisation of provisions 4.3 1.6 3.0 1.2 3.9 14.0 Unused amounts reversed in the year 0.8 0.4 1.6 2.4 5.2 Foreign exchange adjustments 0.1 0.2 0.7 0.4 1.4 At 31 December 2007 13.6 4.5 4.6 7.9 29.2 59.8 Closing balances are analysed as: Current liabilities 1.5 4.0 3.6 2.3 18.1 29.5 Non-current liabilities 12.1 0.5 1.0 5.6 11.1 30.3 13.6 4.5 4.6 7.9 29.2 59.8 Contingent consideration Contingent consideration has been provided for where it is considered probable that the conditions applicable to the payment of contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions made by the Group in current and previous years will be met.
The amount provided is therefore the amount considered likely to be payable in the event of these conditions being met.
Arrangements of this nature vary, but may typically extend for up to five years and are discounted where payable after two years.
The provision at 31 December 2007 is stated after a discount of 0.5m 2006: 0.9m and the unwinding of the discount in the year resulted in a finance charge of 0.4m 2006: 0.2m.
Warranty claims The warranty provision represents managements best estimate of the Groups liability under warranties granted on products sold, based on past experience and industry averages for defective products.
It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next two financial years.
Contract loss provisions Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under those contracts.
The time frame within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, but is generally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity.
Maintenance carried out on a cycle of 12 months or less is charged to the income statement as incurred.
When aircraft are leased, it is customary for the contract to contain specific conditions regarding the state of the aircraft on its return to the lessor at the end of the lease.
These conditions may relate to the number of operational hours to be available before a major maintenance check, the physical configuration of the aircraft or direct costs to be incurred by the lessee in the physical return of the aircraft to the lessor.
The estimated cost associated with fulfilling these requirements is charged to the income statement on an aircraft utilisation basis.
The provision is utilised on actual return of the aircraft or on incurring the expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required by the lease before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Other provisions Other provisions include provisions recognised on warranties and indemnities given on the disposals of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group in 2005.
All amounts have been determined based on the Directors current estimates of likely outcomes.
Provisions relating to the Countermeasures and Fluid and Air disposals are likely to unwind over a period of more than one year but, due to the uncertainty over the timing and amounts, have not been discounted.

The other charge to reserves relates to deferred tax provided in respect of the change in the fair values of cash flow hedging derivatives and share-based payments.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes are analysed as follows: m 2007 2006 Deferred tax liabilities fall due as follows: Within one year 2.7 3.1 After one year 19.8 22.5 22.5 25.6 Deferred tax assets are recoverable as follows: Within one year 4.0 2.1 After one year 4.3 4.8 8.3 6.9 Without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances, deferred tax balances are as follows: Accelerated Retirement tax benefit m depreciation obligations Other Total Deferred tax assets 0.4 10.4 25.6 36.4 Deferred tax liabilities 7.4 43.2 50.6 At 31 December 2007 7.0 10.4 17.6 14.2 Deferred tax assets 1.2 8.9 14.8 24.9 Deferred tax liabilities 9.8 33.8 43.6 At 31 December 2006 8.6 8.9 19.0 18.7 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of 72.0m 2006: 72.0m potentially available for offset against future profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 305.4m 2006: 204.8m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Groups share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures was 4.8m 2006: 5.5m.

All bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The Groups principal borrowings are as follows: In July 2005, a five-year 300m revolving multi-currency credit facility was entered into for general corporate purposes, with extensions of up to two years at the option of the lenders.
During 2006 and 2007 the facility was extended by one year and now expires in 2012.
Interest is payable at the applicable LIBOR rate of the drawn currencies, plus margin.
As at 31 December 2007, 226.4m 2006: 217.3m had been drawn on this facility.
In addition, two tranches of senior notes were issued in 2002, being US$55m maturing in 2009 with a 5.14% coupon and US$170m maturing in 2012 with a 5.58% coupon.
The respective agreements contain no provisions for charges over Group assets and include both financial and non-financial covenants.
There have been no breaches of the terms of loan agreements or defaults during the current or comparative periods.

All cash flow hedges were fully effective and hence there is no ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges to be reported through the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness of the fair value hedge is reported through the income statement.
Most currency translation derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are shown separately in the income statement as part of operating profit.
The fair values of the Groups currency and interest rate derivatives are established using valuation techniques, primarily discounting cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates.

Financial instruments continued The Group does not hold any financial assets which would be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held at fair value through equity.
The borrowings shown in the table above categorised as held at fair value through profit or loss are senior notes which were issued in 2002.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on these is considered to be their carrying value of US$225m 113.0m, 2006: 115.0m.
The change in the fair value of the senior notes is considered to relate entirely to changes in market conditions and is not impacted by changes in credit risk.
The difference between the carrying amount of the senior notes and the amount which the Group is contractually required to pay on maturity is 1.3m 2006: 3.0m.
The total interest income and expense for financial assets and liabilities not held at fair value through profit or loss is as follows: m 2007 2006 Interest income 20.9 22.0 Interest expense 11.6 20.4 The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities recorded in these financial statements approximates to their fair value.
Financial instruments and risk management The Groups multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity rates, interest rates and debt market prices.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Financial instruments The Group finances its operations primarily through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly put in place to manage the currency financing risks arising from normal operations, further details of which are given in note 26.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant exposure for the Group for which financial instruments are employed as mitigation.
The Group is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other European countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures which arise when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of minimising trading in non functional currencies, matching non functional currency revenues with non functional currency costs and through the use of forward contracts.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities are as follows: 2007 2006 million US$ AUS$ US$ AUS$ Monetary assets 132.0 69.2 52.4 108.5 59.0 35.3 Monetary liabilities 329.6 101.4 82.5 341.9 89.9 60.1 Currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
The following borrowings were designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges: Borrowings 246.2 45.4 278.5 42.4 79 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 28.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities.
In addition to the longer-term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December: Average US$: US$ amount exchange rate 2007 2006 2007 2006 Expiring within one year 131.0 108.8 1.93 1.78 Expiring within one to two years 16.2 15.9 1.67 1.64 Expiring after two years 51.3 60.5 1.71 1.67 198.5 185.2 1.84 1.73 The latest date for expiry of US dollar forward foreign currency contracts is 31 December 2014.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change in sterling against the respective foreign currencies.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity where sterling weakens against the respective currency.
A strengthening of sterling would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
2007 2006 m Sensitivity Profit loss Equity Profit loss Equity US dollars 13% 9.0 9.0 9.7 9.7 Euros 8% 3.9 3.9 4.3 4.3 Australian dollars 10% 3.6 3.6 0.3 0.3 The exposure to movements in exchange rates arises due to outstanding non functional currency receivables and payables at the year end.
The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current period mainly due to increased exposure to Australian dollar movements.
Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short term borrowings, principally in US dollars, euros, Australian dollars and sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to acquire interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
Of the Groups fixed rate borrowings, senior notes totalling 113.0m at 31 December 2007 2006: 112.0m were swapped into floating rates on issuance in 2002 through to their maturity in 2009 27.6m and 2012 85.4m, the rates being reset and interest payments made on a six monthly basis.
The Group has applied hedge accounting, designating the swap as a fair value hedge and its fair value is detailed in note 26.
All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are all designated as cash flow hedges and are as follows: Period of swap contract m Fixed rate from to Currency value 2007 2006 US dollar bank loans 4.48% January 2006 June 2010 US$260m 130.6 132.8 Australian dollar bank loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$106m 46.8 16.1 Australian dollar bank loans 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$6m 2.8 The fair value of these cash flow hedge instruments is as detailed in note 26.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit.
These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates on these deposits.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change of 0.1 percent in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables, including foreign currency exchange rates, held constant.
80 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 28.
Financial instruments and risk management continued A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity where interest rates rise.
A fall in interest rates would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

For short-term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the US a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities and the use of the Groups revolving credit facility.
In addition, it is the Groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in various currencies in order to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity.
The following facilities, which are at floating rates, were available at 31 December: m 2007 2006 Expiring within one year 38.4 58.3 Expiring between one and five years 73.6 82.7 112.0 141.0 The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.

Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group further limits risk in this area by setting a maximum level for deposits or overdrafts with any one counterparty.
These facilities are reviewed every six months or more often if there is an indication that the credit rating of any of the banks falls below a Moodys Aa3 rating.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically multinational groups or government agencies with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are also monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2007, 8.9% 2006: 10.9% of gross trade receivables were more than one month overdue.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2007 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 19. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice.
81 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 28.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The Group has not pledged any assets in respect of any of its primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities, except as disclosed in note 15.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented in the financial statements as net.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders equity excluding minority interests, totalling 803.7m at 31 December 2007 2006: 714.9m, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings and currently, because of recent strong earnings coupled with the successful restructuring programme, the Group has capacity to significantly increase borrowings to fund carefully selected acquisition opportunities.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions, proposed dividend levels and Group banking arrangements.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Primary sources of funding for the Group are the bank and private placement markets and typically the Group borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the USA.
As noted above, the Group maintains a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate arrangements and within the overall net cash will have sterling deposits and borrowings in overseas currencies such as US dollars, euros and Australian dollars funding overseas operations.

Acquisitions continued Components of the cost of acquisitions during the year: m Total Cash 10.9 Contingent consideration 2.7 Directly attributable acquisition costs including direct legal costs 0.3 13.9 As at 31 December 2007, fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are provisional and subject to potential subsequent adjustment.
A summary of the book and fair values of the acquisitions which took place during 2007 is as follows: Book value prior m to acquisition Fair value Non-current assets Intangibles 8.3 Property, plant and equipment 2.1 2.6 Current assets Inventories 2.6 2.0 Trade receivables 1.8 1.7 Bank and cash balances Current liabilities Trade payables 2.3 2.3 Net assets acquired 4.2 12.3 Goodwill 1.6 Total consideration 13.9 All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of the total cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised.
Adjustments from book value to fair value include adjustments arising from the application of Group accounting policies, the recognition of intangible assets under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and inventories.
The net cash outflows arising from the acquisitions in 2007 amounts to 11.2m all of which is cash consideration and includes expenses of acquisition.
The after tax result of the acquisitions since the date of acquisition was a loss of 0.9m, including amortisation of intangible fixed assets arising on acquisition of 1.0m.
If these acquisitions had taken effect on 1 January 2007, it is estimated that Group total revenues would have been 1,070.9m and profit after tax 131.9m.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of future results of the combined operations.
Discontinued operations No businesses were sold or classified as discontinued during the year to 31 December 2007.

Contingent liabilities As at 31 December 2007, the parent company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business entered into for, or on behalf of, certain Group undertakings.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements or within those of the relevant subsidiary.
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability exists at the year end.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
