Unless otherwise stated, impairment reviews are carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in notes 2 and 3. a Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas goodwill of 57 million includes 47 million 2006 53 million relating to the Staley acquisition, which is treated as one cash generating unit CGU for impairment testing purposes as the business is managed as one entity and it is therefore not appropriate to allocate goodwill to individual plants.
Cash flows used were based on the latest approved plans for five years discounted at 13% 2006 12%.
Remaining goodwill relates to Continental Custom Ingredients, which was acquired in 2006.
This business has also been tested for impairment using management projections of cashflows for five years and a pre-tax discount rate of 13%.
No impairment is required for either business.
In the prior year goodwill of 7 million was included relating to the astaxanthin business.
This business has continued to be loss making in the year ended 31 March 2007 and based on future expected cash flows goodwill has now been fully impaired.
b Goodwill in the Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe division of 101 million includes 86 million 2006 90 million relating to the acquisition in 2000 of the minority of 34% of shares of the former Amylum business.
Although cash flows have been identified for certain individual plants for the purposes of assessing the recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment as described in note 16 the business is managed as a network, with a large amount of interdependency between plants and centralised decision making.
Consequently goodwill is monitored at a divisional level and allocated to a group of plant CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing.
As a result of the proposed changes to the EU Sugar Regime, management concluded in 2006 that in certain markets the business would be unlikely to be able to generate sufficient returns to cover its cost of capital.
As required by IAS36 the property, plant and equipment was reviewed first, resulting in an impairment charge of 263 million in the year ended 31 March 2006.
No additional impairment charge was required in 2007.
Subsequently, the goodwill was tested for impairment.
In 2006 recoverable amount was estimated based on the assets remaining after the impairment to property, plant and equipment.
Recoverable amount was based on value in use, which was calculated based on estimated future cash flows using management internal forecasts of future margins excluding the impact of any major initiatives for the next five years.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 11% and zero growth was assumed in perpetuity due to the regulated nature of the market.
As a result of this review in 2006 management concluded that no impairment was required.
In 2007, a similar approach was adopted to the impairment test, although fair value less costs to sell was used for the part of the business identified for potential disposal as set out in note 38.
For the part of the business that will be retained by the Group the recoverable amount was calculated using the same methodology and similar assumptions to the prior year.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 12%.
Management has again concluded that no impairment is required.
Additional goodwill relates mainly to Cesalpinia Food, which was acquired in 2006.
This business has also been tested for impairment using management projections of cash flows for five years and a pre-tax discount rate of 12%.
