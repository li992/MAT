Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 15 Fair values of financial instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Marketable securities The carrying amount approximates fair value because these instruments are marked-to-market.
Foreign currency contracts and embedded derivatives The fair value of foreign currency contracts and embedded derivatives is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts is derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model and includes the balance sheet spot rate, currency volatility and respective interest rate curves for the different currencies as inputs to this model.
Short-term debt During the year, the Company entered into a 100 million revolving credit facility providing the Company access to funds for any corporate purpose.
Whilst the Company did make various drawdowns totalling 30 million on this facility during the year, these had been fully repaid and the facility was undrawn at the balance sheet date.
Any drawn amounts accrue interest at a LIBOR-plus rate whilst there is a nominal charge for the undrawn portion.
Furthermore, the facility requires the Company to adhere to various financial covenants relating to EBITDA multiples and interest cover: the Company adhered to all covenants during the year.
The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows: At 31 December 2006 2007 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 90,743 90,743 49,509 49,509 Short-term investments 18,600 18,600 232 232 Marketable securities 19,151 19,151 1,582 1,582 Accounts receivable 69,552 69,552 68,232 68,232 Foreign currency contracts 439 439 496 496 Embedded derivatives 1,620 1,620 220 220 Short-term debt 16 Valuation and qualifying accounts Charged Acquired credited to with Utilized Balance at income subsidiary ReclassicForeign Balance at 1 January statement undertaking ation exchange 31 December 000 000 000 000 000 000 2007 allowance for doubtful debts 2,556 215 1,253 14 1,504 2006 allowance for doubtful debts 2,173 932 377 172 2,556 2005 allowance for doubtful debts 1,451 547 27 148 2,173 2007 valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 6,049 4,824 749 533 17 9,574 2006 valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 366 3,394 2,289 6,049 2005 valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 254 112 366 17 Post balance sheet events At the 2008 Annual General Meeting of the Company, a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share total cost 15.3 million will be proposed in respect of the 2007 financial year, and if approved will be paid on 21 May 2008 to shareholders on the register on 2 May 2008.
