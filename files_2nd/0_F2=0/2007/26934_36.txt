Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued viii Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The policy is that debt as shown below should be no more than 15% of the Groups net assets.
The Companys capital at 31 December comprises: 2007 2006 000 000 Debt: Bank overdrafts 543 8,156 543 8,156 Equity: Equity share capital 8,607 8,415 Retained earnings and other reserves 1,259,513 860,130 1,268,120 868,545 Total capital 1,268,663 876,701 Debt as a percentage of total capital 0% 1% The Board with the assistance of the Investment Manager monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Investment Managers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : the need for new issues of equity shares, including issues from treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the bank borrowings under the overdraft facility are not to exceed 15% of ordinary share capital plus reserves: as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since last year, and the Company has complied with them.
Contingent liabilities There were no contingent liabilities at 31 December 2007 31 December 2006: nil, except derivatives in note 19 above.
