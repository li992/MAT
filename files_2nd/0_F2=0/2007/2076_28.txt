Underlying EBIT for the year ended 30 June 2007 was US$20.1 billion compared with US$15.3 billion, an increase of 31.4 per cent.
The increase in EBIT and Underlying EBIT was due primarily to higher commodity prices.
Nickel, copper, aluminium, iron ore and petroleum product prices contributed significantly to the increase in revenue and Underlying EBIT.
The following commentary details the approximate impact of the principal factors that affected EBIT and Underlying EBIT for FY2007 compared with FY2006.
Volumes Continued strong demand underpinned increased sales volumes of metallurgical coal, petroleum products, nickel, manganese ore, alumina, zinc, iron ore, aluminium and energy coal, which contributed approximately US$438 million more measured at last years average margins to Underlying EBIT than last year.
Sales volumes of base metals were lower at Olympic Dam Australia due to a smelter shutdown and at Cannington Australia due to the temporary closure of the southern zone.
However, this was more than offset by copper sales from Spence Chile, which commenced operations in December 2006 and added US$363 million, and the ramp up of the Sulphide Leach project at Escondida Chile.
We experienced a decrease in diamond sales for the year as a result of inventory sales in the prior year.
Prices Net changes in prices increased Underlying EBIT by US$7,101 million.
Lower prices for metallurgical coal and manganese ore had a negative impact.
Additional detail on the effect of price changes appears in the Customer Sector Group Summary in Section 3.6.
Higher price-linked costs reduced Underlying EBIT by US$979 million with increased charges for third party nickel contributing US$658 million to this amount.
Higher royalties for nickel, iron ore, and higher LME-linked power charges in aluminium were offset by lower metallurgical coal royalties in line with lower prices and more favourable rates for copper treatment and refining charges TCRCs, including the removal or limiting of price participation in new contracts.
Costs Continued strong global demand for resources has led to increased costs across the industry for labour, contractors, raw materials, fuel, energy and other input costs.
In addition, port congestion and other third party infrastructure constraints resulted in increased demurrage costs and shipping, freight and other distribution charges.
In this environment, our costs have increased by US$859 million.
Excluding non-cash costs of US$145 million, this represents an increase on our June 2006 total cost base of 3.6 per cent.
Given the current market tightness, we believe this represents an outstanding performance.
Specific areas of cost increases include labour and contractor charges, consumables and fuels, business development expenditure, maintenance and other operating costs.
Changed mining conditions, particularly at Cannington where we had a temporary closure of the southern zone and higher strip ratios at Queensland Coal Australia had a negative impact.
However, we generated savings of US$203 million on our 2006 cost base through a wide range of business improvement initiatives across the Group.
The current environment continues to be challenging across the resources industry, and the pressure on access to labour and other inputs to our business remains.
However, the quality of orebodies, our supplier relationships, systems and capabilities of our people have allowed us to manage these challenges.
Exchange rates Exchange rate movements had a negative impact on Underlying EBIT of US$271 million.
The stronger Australian dollar had a negative impact of US$478 million.
This was partially offset by the favourable impact of a weaker South African rand on operating costs for our South African businesses.
The Western Australian Iron Ore and Queensland Coal operations were both significantly impacted by the strength of the Australian dollar.
The following exchange rates relative to the US dollar have been applied: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2007 30 June 2006 30 June 2007 30 June 2006 Average Average Closing Closing a Australian dollar 0.79 0.75 0.85 0.74 South African rand 7.20 6.41 7.08 7.12 a Displayed as US$ to A$1 based on common convention.

molybdenum from operations existing at the beginning of the year These pressures were most evident in Australia and South Africa.
contributed approximately US$304 million to Underlying EBIT measured at the prior periods average margins.
Sales volumes of Asset sales oil were lower than the prior year due to natural field decline and The sale of assets and interests decreased Underlying EBIT by increased down time at existing assets.
Depletion of reserves at US$61 million compared to FY2006.
The current period was Riverside Australia, extended maintenance outages at Blackwater principally impacted by the sale of one million tonnes of annual Australia and reduced shipments led to a decrease in sales capacity at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal South Africa, the volumes of metallurgical coal.
Reduced market demand for Moranbah Coal Bed Methane assets Australia, the Koornfontein manganese alloy led to lower sales volumes for the period.
We also energy coal mine South Africa, the interest in Eyesizwe South experienced decreased sales volumes of silver due to lower Africa and Alliance Copper Chile.
In the corresponding period, production from our Cannington mine Australia resulting from we had higher profits arising largely from the divestment of our lower head grades and temporary closure of the southern zone.
interest in the Wonderkop chrome joint venture South Africa, Volumes new and acquired operations the Vincent Van Gogh undeveloped oil discovery Australia and the Green Canyon oil fields US.
New operations increased Underlying EBIT by US$1,295 million, primarily due to a full years contribution of US$918 million from Ceased and sold operations the ex-WMC Resources Limited WMC operations acquired in June The current period was negatively impacted by the loss of 2005.
Also included was a full years production from ROD Algeria, which commenced commercial production in October US$343 million of Underlying EBIT from Tintaya Peru divested in June 2006 and the Southern Cross Fertiliser operations Australia 2004, Mad Dog US and Angostura Trinidad and Tobago, which were both commissioned in January 2005. divested in August 2006.
This was partly offset by a US$82 million year-on-year impact of movements in restoration and Prices rehabilitation provisions for closed operations.
Stronger commodity prices for most products increased Underlying Exploration and business development EBIT by US$6,690 million.
Higher prices for most base metals products copper in particular, metallurgical coal, iron ore, all Gross exploration expenditure increased to US$805 million during the year.
We increased activity on nickel targets in Western petroleum products and aluminium contributed approximately US$7,200 million, which was partially offset by lower prices for Australia, Guatemala, Indonesia and the Philippines and on energy coal targets in New South Wales Australia.
This increased manganese alloy and the sale of lower quality diamonds.

This resulted in exploration expense being US$17 million lower Strong demand for resources globally has continued, leading to than last year.
increased costs across the industry for labour, contractors, raw materials, fuel, energy and other input costs.
In this environment, Expenditure on business development was US$166 million higher costs for the Group have increased by US$1,340 million, inclusive than last year mainly due to the pre-feasibility study on the of non-cash costs of US$125 million, primarily related to increased Olympic Dam expansion and other Base Metals activities.
depreciation due to the commissioning of new projects.
Net of non-cash costs, this represents an increase on our 2005 cost base Other of 5.7 per cent.
Other items increased Underlying EBIT by US$36 million.
These included higher insurance recoveries than last year, partially offset Specific areas of cost increases include changed mining conditions, by a lower contribution from freight and other activities.
particularly at EKATI Canada, where we are mining a lower grade zone, and Queensland Coal Australia, where mine mix changed Year ended 30 June 2006 to year ended 30 June 2005 following the closure of Riverside.
Labour and contractor charges, fuel and consumables, as well as maintenance and other operating Profit from operations EBIT for the year ended 30 June 2006 was US$14.7 billion compared with US$9.3 billion in the prior year, an costs, have also increased.
The commissioning of a number of new operations meant depreciation charges also increased.
Underlying EBIT for the year ended 30 June 2006 was US$15.3 billion compared with US$9.9 billion in the Price-linked costs prior year, an increase of 54.0 per cent.
Higher price-linked costs reduced Underlying EBIT by US$475 The increase in EBIT and Underlying EBIT was due primarily to million, largely because of higher royalties particularly for higher commodity prices.
Metallurgical coal, iron ore, base metals, Metallurgical Coal, Iron Ore and Petroleum products, increased aluminium and petroleum prices contributed significantly to the treatment and refining charges TCRCs, and price participation increase in revenue and Underlying EBIT.
New and acquired charges for copper and higher LME-linked power charges in operations also provided increased volumes.
The following commentary details the approximate impact of the Exchange rates principal factors that affected EBIT and Underlying EBIT for FY2006 compared with FY2005.
Exchange rate movements had a net nil impact on Underlying EBIT compared with last year.
The translation of monetary items had a favourable impact on Underlying EBIT of US$90 million principally due to exchange gains from the strengthening of the US dollar against the Australian dollar.
This compared to losses in the prior period.
This was offset by an unfavourable impact on operating costs of US$90 million primarily due to the strengthening of the Brazilian real against the US dollar.

We engage in third party product trading for two reasons: In providing solutions for our customers, sometimes we provide products that we do not produce, such as a particular grade of coal.
To meet customer needs, we buy physical product from third parties and manage risk through both the physical and financial markets.
