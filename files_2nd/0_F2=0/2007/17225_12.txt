The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes are wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2005 and 1 April 2004 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 Employee Benefits purposes for the periods to 4 February 2007 and 29 January 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 5 February 2007 is 95m.
Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Rate of increases in salaries 4.45 5.45% 4.25 5.25% 4.25 5.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.20% 3.00% 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.00% 4.75% 5.25% Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.00% 3.00% Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at the age of 65 is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Male 19.9 19.9 19.9 Female 22.8 22.8 22.8 The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00% Bonds 5.00% 4.25% 5.00% Property related funds 6.00% 7.00% 7.00% Active currency management assets 5.25% 4.50% Cash 5.25% 4.50% 4.75% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Equities 1,208.0 1,190.3 958.1 Bonds 221.2 211.2 163.7 Property related funds 259.5 54.0 12.5 Active currency management assets 66.3 21.4 Cash 19.0 58.9 82.6 Total fair value of schemes assets 1,774.0 1,535.8 1,216.9 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 1,971.9 1,952.0 1,625.0 Deficit in the scheme pension liability recognised in the balance sheet 197.9 416.2 408.1 Related deferred tax asset note 18 59.4 124.9 122.4 Net deficit 138.5 291.3 285.7 03 Report 2007 40-65. qxp 16 4 07 4:42 pm Page 57 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2007 57 19 Pension liabilities continued The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the following periods was: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 1,535.8 1,216.9 1,035.4 Expected return on scheme assets 102.0 83.2 64.1 Actuarial gains 77.5 165.3 59.9 Employer contributions 94.6 92.1 63.4 Employee contributions 11.0 12.9 16.7 Benefits paid 46.9 34.6 22.6 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 1,774.0 1,535.8 1,216.9 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the parent companys own shares or property occupied by the Company or its subsidiaries at the period ends.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.

In June 2001 the Group established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Group makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 m m m Stakeholder pension scheme 1.4 1.1 1.0 Life assurance scheme 0.9 0.9 0.5 Total costs 2.3 2.0 1.5 03 Report 2007 40-65. qxp 16 4 07 4:42 pm Page 59 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2007 59 Property Restructuring provisions Total 20 Provisions m m m At 29 January 2006 53.7 73.5 127.2 Charged to the income statement 35.5 34.9 70.4 Utilised in period 39.6 19.2 58.8 Unwinding of discount 6.16.1 At 4 February 2007 49.6 95.3 144.9 Restructuring The restructuring provision includes the costs associated with the branding exercise noted in the accounting policy use of critical accounting assumptions and estimates on page 43.
The majority of the costs are anticipated to be incurred over the first half of the new financial year, in line with the roll-out plan for this project.
The continuing restructuring programme of the distribution network is also included in this balance.
Property provisions Property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve, onerous leases provision and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Decommissioning costs are incurred when the petrol filling station tanks have reached the end of their useful life or when they become redundant.
A provision is recognised on commissioning the petrol filling station for the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
The discount in the provision is unwound until, at the end of the useful life, the provision is sufficient to pay the decommissioning costs.
Onerous leases relate to sublet properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from 1 to 66 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and so the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to its original leased condition.
Provision is made for these costs, which are typically paid to the landlord on termination of the lease.

In line with IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the Group has fair valued all grants of equity instruments issued after 7 November 2002 which were unvested as of 1 January 2005 and all shadow equity instruments which were unvested as of 1 January 2005.

i Executive share option scheme In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005.
The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.
The scheme is equity settled.
Those options which have been granted after 7 November 2002 have been fair valued using the Binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions are as follows: Grant date 12 11 2004 02 04 2003 Share price at grant date 2.33 1.81 Fair value of options granted 1.4m 1.9m Exercise price 2.22 1.75 Dividend yield 1.43% 1.49% Annual risk-free interest rate 4.61% 4.12% Expected volatility 29.4% 29.4% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of weekly share prices over the last six years.

Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions and is equity settled.
