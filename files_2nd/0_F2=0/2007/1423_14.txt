Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 15 September 2007 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 369m 2006 301m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million 2006 790 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Option Scheme on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, provision for loss on termination of an operation, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, exceptional items and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 790 million 2006 790 million.
There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment Goodwill As at 15 September 2007, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 1,023m.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows: 2007 2006 Cash-generating unit CGU or group of CGUs Primary reporting segment m m ACH Grocery 200 208 AB Mauri Ingredients 222 232 Twinings Ovaltine Grocery 119 122 Capullo Grocery 58 58 Illovo Sugar 143 148 Pataks Grocery 58 Other Various 223 245 1,023 1,013 The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs is not individually significant.
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
There have been no indications of impairment relating to the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and, accordingly, the disclosures that follow relate to the impairment test that is required to be conducted on an annual basis: The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs based on the most recent budget.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budget are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The rates used vary between 8% and 11%.
The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5%.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.

Property, plant & equipment continued Impairment UK sugar operations The reform of the EU sugar regime has impacted adversely on the performance of the groups European sugar operations and is expected to have further adverse consequences in the future.
In the prior year, management considered the impact of the reform of the EU sugar regime on the groups operations and as a result, the carrying value and useful lives of the affected factories were assessed for impairment.
The carrying value of each of the affected factories was assessed separately for impairment on the basis of value in use.
The cash flow projections used for this purpose were based on budget information resulting in an impairment charge of 64m in the prior year income statement.
The impairment was included as a depreciation charge within operating costs within the Sugar segment.

Employee entitlements The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
The group also operates a small number of unfunded overseas post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
UK schemes The groups principal UK defined benefit pension schemes are funded schemes and are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for other employees.
The pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, and are reflected in the balance sheet at 15 September 2007.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested.
The last actuarial valuations of the British Sugar Pension Scheme and the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme were carried out as at 1 October 2004 and 5 April 2005 respectively.
At the valuation dates the total market value of the assets of these schemes was 1,869m and represented 97% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
On 6 April 2006, the British Sugar Pension Scheme was merged into the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme.
Their respective funding positions were recalculated at that point and the group agreed to make two payments of 14.5m, the first in October 2006 and the second in October 2007, to eliminate the deficit at 6 April 2006 in the British Sugar section of the newly-merged scheme.
Overseas schemes The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, France, the Philippines, Thailand, South Africa and Zambia.
These schemes are primarily funded schemes.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as for defined benefit pension schemes.
Assumptions The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, are: 2007 2006 2005 %%% Discount rate 5.80 5.10 5.00 Inflation 3.30 3.00 2.80 Rate of increase in salaries 4.80 4.50 4.50 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.10 2.80 2.50 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.30 3.00 2.80 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 generational mortality tables with medium cohort improvements, as published by the Institute of Actuaries.
The mortality rates underlying these tables have been adjusted to take account of the schemes actual experience.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Member aged 65 in 2007 19.3 22.1 Member aged 65 in 2027 20.3 23.0 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The UK schemes net pension asset of 284m less the overseas schemes net pension liability of 8m totals 276m.
This equates to the employee benefits asset of 308m and liability of 31m shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, together with a 1m employee benefits liability included within liabilities classified as held for sale.

In addition, 4m of deferred tax liabilities are included in liabilities classified as held for sale.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned.
Other deferred tax assets totalling 3m 2006 2m have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
In addition, there are temporary differences of 1,024m 2006 834m relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale As a result of the negotiations around the post year-end acquisition of certain European assets of Gilde Bakery Ingredients see note 29, our existing German yeast business was classified as a disposal group held for sale at the year end.
The operations are included in the Ingredients and Europe, Middle East & Africa segments.
The disposal of the business would not constitute a discontinued operation.
As at 15 September 2007, the disposal group comprised intangible assets of 31m, property, plant & equipment of 9m, other assets of 2m and liabilities of 7m.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of this operation as held for sale.
Various other assets, principally comprising property, plant & equipment, are also classified as held for sale at the year end, covering the Grocery, Sugar, Ingredients and Agriculture segments.
In the prior year, the primary disposal group was the Scandinavian distribution business, Haugen-Gruppen, disposal of which was completed on 4 October 2006.
The disposal group comprised assets of 38m and liabilities of 11m.
The remaining 15m of assets classified as held for sale were various items of property, plant & equipment within the Grocery, Agriculture and Ingredients segments.

Other financial assets and liabilities continued Sensitivity analysis The table below presents the impact that changes in market rates would have on the fair value of the groups financial instruments were the changes to occur at the balance sheet date and persist for a one year period.
The sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact of a 100 basis point movement in yields, a 10% movement of sterling against other currencies and a 10% movement in commodity prices.
All other variables are assumed to be constant.
This is a method of analysis used to assess risk and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
Actual results and market conditions in the future may be materially different from those projected and changes in the instruments held or in the financial markets in which the group operates could cause gains or losses to exceed the amounts projected.

Based on the composition of net debt at 15 September 2007, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional 2m 2006 2m in net interest expense being incurred per year.
The financial instruments above include trade and other receivables of 2m and trade and other payables of 2m that are classified as held for sale at year end.

The amount payable by the Company on redemption is the amount paid up on the deferred shares.
Redemption is at the sole discretion of the Company.
Deferred shares carry no voting rights and have no rights to dividends or other income distributions.
In the event of a winding-up, repayment in respect of the deferred shares ranks after repayment of amounts paid up on the ordinary shares of the Company.
The deferred shares are entitled to repayment of amounts paid up, but have no entitlement to any surplus.
Other reserves The other reserves arose from the cancellation of 173m of share premium account by the Company in 1993 and is non-distributable.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the groups net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

Acquisitions and disposals continued There were no material differences between pre-acquisition carrying amounts and amounts recognised on acquisition, which include fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities acquired, with the exception of 72m of intangibles, a 2m downward adjustment to property, plant & equipment and a 21m adjustment to deferred tax.
Acquisition of Worldwing Investments Limited The acquisition of 100% of the shares of Worldwing Investments Limited Worldwing, the holding company for the Pataks group of companies, was completed on 5 September 2007, satisfied in cash and deferred consideration, including transaction costs.
The acquired group contributed no net profit to the consolidated net profit for the year.
The contribution to consolidated revenue and net profit had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year has not been disclosed, as it would be impractical to determine these amounts.
This is because i as a privately-held group Worldwing prepared its consolidated financial statements under United Kingdom accounting standards, which are substantively different to Adopted IFRS: ii Worldwing had a different year end to the group 30 September : and iii the last available consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 30 September 2006, all of which is insufficient to determine accurately the fair value adjustments that would have been made to the balance sheet one year ago.

Accounting estimates and judgements Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the accounting policies detailed on pages 52 to 57, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from the groups operations which, in some circumstances, are discounted to arrive at a net present value: The carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually and also when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
This assessment involves comparing the book value of goodwill with its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate.
No impairment resulted from the assessment conducted in 2007: however, both the projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.
The realisation of deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise.
The group recognises deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered, based on an assessment of the likelihood of there being sufficient taxable profits in the future.
Post-retirement benefits The groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which has been assessed using assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in an asset of 308m and a liability of 31m being recognised as at 15 September 2007.
The size of these assets and liabilities is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes, to the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, and to the actuarial assumptions which include price inflation, rates of pension and salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the level of contributions.
Further details are included in note 12.
Provisions As described in the accounting policies on pages 52 to 57, provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are made taking into account a range of possible outcomes.

Accounting estimates and judgements continued Property, plant & equipment residual values and useful lives These assets are written down to their estimated residual values over their anticipated useful lives using the straight-line basis.
Management reviews residual values annually considering market conditions and projected disposal values.
In assessing useful lives, maintenance programmes and technological innovations are considered.
The carrying value of property, plant & equipment is disclosed in note 9.
Biological assets Cane roots valuation the escalated average cost of planting cane roots is adjusted for the remaining expected life.
This requires an estimation by management of the average number of ratoons expected from the crop.
The carrying value of cane roots is disclosed in note 10.
Growing cane valuation growing cane is valued at the estimated sucrose content valued at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport.
The estimated sucrose content requires management to assess the expected cane and sucrose yields for the following season considering weather conditions and harvesting programmes.
In assessing the estimated sucrose price, management is required to assess into which markets the forthcoming crop will be sold and assess domestic and export prices as well as the related foreign currency exchange rates.
The carrying value of growing cane is disclosed in note 10.
