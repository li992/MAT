The financial statements are presented in Sterling and have been prepared on an historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, other non-current investments and certain financial instruments as described in section xvii below have been stated at fair value.
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, which apply in relation to financial guarantee contracts, both of which are effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where Group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness or obligations of other companies within the Group, these are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the guarantor will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Accordingly, the amendments have not had any impact upon these financial statements.
As at the date of these financial statements, IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure, had been issued but was not effective and has not been adopted by the Group.
On adoption, the Standard will affect only presentation and disclosure and will not result in any adjustments to the financial statements.
ii SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements that are not readily apparent from other sources.
However, the actual results may differ from these estimates.
The measurement of fair value constitutes the main area of judgement exercised by the Board in respect of the Groups results.
In relation to the Groups investment and development properties, the Board has relied upon the external valuations carried out by professionally qualied valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Copies of the valuation reports of Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited, which together account for 98.5% of these categories of non-current assets, and of Christie Co, which values the investment properties within Quercus, currently the Groups principal joint venture, are contained on pages 62 and 63.
In respect of derivative financial instruments, the Board has relied on the valuation carried out by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, financial risk consultants, and the basis for this exercise is referred to below in section xvii of this note and in note 21.
The Board has also exercised its judgement in relation to the recognition of certain deferred tax assets, which is discussed in further detail in note 6iv, and in assessing the recoverability of trade receivables by reference to their age and the ability of debtors to pay.
Other areas of judgement, risk and uncertainty which are relevant to an understanding of these results and the Groups financial position are referred to in the Operating and Financial Review.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
iii BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the Group, and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 104 to 111.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date it ceases.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant inuence but not control over financial and operating policies.
The Group equity accounts for its share of net profit after tax of joint ventures and associates, which includes its share of fair value adjustments to their investment properties, through the Income Statement.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cashow hedges within joint ventures less any related tax is recognised directly in equity.
All other changes are recognised in the Income Statement.
The Groups interest in the net assets of joint ventures and associates is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Operating income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates.
The year end and average rates used for these purposes were as follows: Year end Average 2007 2006 2007 2006 France 1 1.47 1.44 1.49 1.47 United States 1 $1.96 $1.74 $1.89 $1.79 Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are reected in the translation reserve and released to the Income Statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
v REVENUE AND COST OF SALES Revenue is stated net of VAT and comprises rental income, proceeds from sales of trading properties, income from hotel operations, fees from fund management, commissions and other income.
Rental income from investment and development properties leased out under operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent rents such as turnover rents and indexed rents are recognised as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or the period to the first tenant break, if shorter.
Property operating costs are expensed as incurred including any element of service charge expenditure not recovered from tenants.
Sales of trading properties are recognised on the unconditional exchange of contracts by the Balance Sheet date.
Income from hotel operations represents income receivable from the Plaza Hotel, Wembley prior to the redevelopment of the site, for which outline planning consent has been obtained.
Fees from fund management relate to base and performance fees receivable in respect of asset management together with property procurement fees.
Performance fees are recognised when it is likely that performance criteria have been met.
Other income comprises income receivable from derivative instruments entered into by the Group, tenant lease surrender premiums, insurance commission, car parking receipts, property management fees and miscellaneous income.
vi PURCHASE AND DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES HELD AS NON-CURRENT ASSETS Property purchases and sales are recognised in the accounts on the date of unconditional exchange or, where an exchange is conditional, on the date that conditions have been satisfied.
profits or losses arising on disposal are calculated by reference to the carrying value of the asset at the beginning of the year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
vii IMPAIRMENT The Groups assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication becomes evident, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value-in-use.
The value-in-use is determined as the net present value of the future cashows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Any impairment of financial assets is based on the original effective interest rate attributable to the financial asset on acquisition.
viii EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pensions Contributions to employees personal pension plans are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Share-based payment schemes The fair value of equity rights is estimated using the Black Scholes and binomial models at the date of grant to Directors and staff and is dependent on factors such as the exercise price, expected volatility, option price and risk free interest rate.
The fair value is then amortised through the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Expected volatility is determined based on the historical share price volatility market price for the Company on the grant date over a period matched to the expected life of the awards.
ix CAPITALISATION OF BORROWING COSTS Net borrowing costs in respect of capital expenditure on properties under development or undergoing refurbishment are capitalised.
Interest is capitalised using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing from the commencement of development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
indd 8 25 07 2007 11:36:43 QUINTAIN ESTATES AND DEVELOPMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 81 x TAX Tax is included in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates applicable at the Balance Sheet date.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates applicable at the Balance Sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
xi DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the loss from discontinued operations is shown in the Income Statement net of tax.
xii INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held either for long term rental growth or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost including related transaction costs and valued annually by professionally qualied external valuers.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and in the case of investment properties under development, capitalised interest.
Investment properties are independently valued annually by external valuers at market value.
The valuations are prepared by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable from the properties and where relevant, associated costs.
A yield which reects the specic risks inherent in the net cashows is then applied to the net annual rentals to arrive at the property valuation.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the Income Statement of the period in which they arise.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property and is not reclassied.
xiii DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classied as development properties and stated at fair value in accordance with IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Changes in fair value are recognised through equity in the revaluation reserve.
However, a deficit on revaluation of a development property is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent it exceeds any surplus held in the revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that property.
Similarly, a surplus on revaluation is credited to the Income Statement to the extent of a deficit previously charged.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When development properties are completed, they are reclassied as investment properties and any accumulated balance on revaluation is transferred to retained earnings.
Development properties which are independently valued annually by external professional valuers are stated at estimated market value on completion less estimated costs to complete.
xiv LEASES The Group as lessor Leases are classied according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classied as a finance lease.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
The Board has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17, Leases, for all properties leased to tenants and has determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Accordingly, all the Groups leasehold properties are classied as investment or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
The Group as lessee The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the Balance Sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Payments to the Groups landlords are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rent reviews are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful life of these assets estimated at between three to five years.
xvi TRADING PROPERTIES Trading properties are properties acquired or developed and held for sale and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of trading properties is determined on the basis of specic identication of their individual costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
xvii FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Other non-current investments Other non-current investments are non-derivative investments that are designated as available for sale.
As permitted, these were previously held at cost less impairment owing to information on which to assess fair value being unavailable.
At the current year end, these investments are shown at fair value.
Non-current receivables Non-current receivables are held at amortised cost.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at invoiced values less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand, deposits with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank loans and other borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are non interest-bearing and are recognised at invoiced amount.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risk.
These derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently re-measured.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as cashow hedges, in which case the effective element of the gain or loss is recognised directly through equity in a hedging reserve.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the Balance Sheet date, taking account of current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The Groups interest rate swaps are shown in these accounts at fair value as derived by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, financial risk consultants, based on market prices, estimated future cashows and forward rates as appropriate.
Other derivative instruments From time to time, the Group invests in derivatives to mitigate or enhance its exposure to a particular class or a spectrum of property assets and related businesses.
Such instruments are accounted for initially at fair value with subsequent adjustments to fair value being reected through the Income Statement.
xviii OWN SHARES HELD BY ESOP TRUSTS AND TREASURY SHARES Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP Trusts, The Quintain Group Employee benefit Trust and The Quintain Estates and Development Deferred Bonus Plan Trust, are included in the Groups financial statements.
