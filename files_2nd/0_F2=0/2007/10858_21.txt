64 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedge against the Group net investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
