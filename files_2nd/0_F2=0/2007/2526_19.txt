Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Taxation Current tax including UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences which represent an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.

Financial instruments comprise cash and short term investments together with debtors, creditors and accruals.
The risks that arise from these instruments are currency exposure, interest rate and liquidity, and the policies followed throughout the year are as follows: Currency risk The Group trades in US dollars and euros as well as in sterling, having both income and expenses in all of these currencies, and this trading results in a surplus of dollars and euros.
The Group hedges these surpluses at the start of each financial year in order to minimise the impact on that years trading from exchange rate fluctuations.
This is done by arranging forward exchange contracts month by month to sell a portion of the expected surpluses.
Interest rate risk The Group places most of its liquid assets on deposit for periods of between one and six months.
These deposits are with recognised UK high street banks.
During the year the average interest rate received on these deposits was 5.12% 2006: 4.45%.
Liquidity risk Liquidity is maintained by placing cash on deposit having regard to the Groups liquidity requirements which are assessed on a regular basis.
The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Groups financial assets as at the balance sheet date.
Credit risk Credit risk is primarily attributable to the Groupss trade debtors.
The average credit period taken on sales goods is 47 days.
An allowance has been made for potential bad debts in arriving at the amounts stated in the balance sheet.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in its debtors as the exposure is spread over a very wide range of customers.

Abcam plc Annual report and accounts 30 June 2007 Our vision is to build the largest online antibody resource in the world while also ensuring that the antibodies are of excellent quality and commercial viability.
My name is Molly, Im the resident Abcam mascot and appear on all our packaging and branding materials.
A lot of researchers ask where we got the idea for Molly the sheep.
It was simply because Dolly the sheep was making headline news at the time, so we created the body out of a molecular space fill model and gave her antibody legs, and thus the molecular Dolly became Abcams Molly.
