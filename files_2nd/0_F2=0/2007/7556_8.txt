Galiform plc Annual Report 2007 External appointments It is recognised that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that exposure to such duties can broaden their experience and skills, which will benefit the Company.
Galiform allows executive directors and other appropriate senior employees to accept a maximum of one non-executive appointment outside the Company, subject to permission from the Committee, provided this is not with a competing company nor likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
No such appointments are currently in place.
Executive directors may retain the fees paid to them in respect of their non-executive duties.
non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive director appointments are for an initial period of three years.
They are subject to re-appointment every three years, and annually after nine years.
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of service or notice periods and are not entitled to any form of compensation in the event of early termination for whatever reason.
The remuneration of non-executive directors, other than the Chairman is considered by the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee while the Chairman is absent.
During the year a review of non-executive and Chairmans fee levels was conducted, although it was felt that no increases for 2008 were necessary.
It is intended that a further review will be conducted in 2008 to ensure that remuneration for non-executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles.
