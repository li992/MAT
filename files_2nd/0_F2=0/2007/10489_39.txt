 In order to provide for its ongoing capital needs post-demerger, the Group entered into two additional external financing arrangements during the year.
The amounts initially drawn down on these facilities were used to refinance existing debt obligations outstanding to the Anglo American plc group prior to demerger.
 UKRCF The UKRCF is a five year multi-currency revolving credit facility which was signed on 22 June 2007.
Interest is charged on the balance outstanding at a market-related rate linked to LIBOR.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to limit its exposure to adverse movements in LIBOR see note 38.
 SATF The SATF is a South African rand three year amortising term loan which was signed and drawn down on 4 May 2007.
Interest is charged on the balance outstanding at a market-related rate linked to JIBAR.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to limit its exposure to adverse movements in JIBAR see note 38.
