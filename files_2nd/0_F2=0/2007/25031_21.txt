IG Group Holdings plc 58 Report and Financial Statements 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2007 4.
Segment information The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
Primary reporting format business segments The primary segment reporting format is by business segment as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products provided.
As explained in the Chief Executives Report, the financial segment includes financial binaries, which were reported separately in the previous year.
The directors consider that including financial binaries within the financial segment is appropriate for the following reasons: financial binaries are viewed by most of our clients as an adjunct to the rest of our financial product range, rather than as a stand-alone product: financial binaries and other financial businesses share common management and processes: and financial binaries are predominantly traded by the same clients as other financial clients on their regulated accounts.
Figures for the prior year have been restated to aid comparability.
