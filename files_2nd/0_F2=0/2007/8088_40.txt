Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The CGUs are in line with the segments as identified in Note 6.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Academic & Scientific Division Scientific, Technical & Medical 536,828 428,769 Humanities & Social Sciences 147,903 146,076 684,731 574,845 Professional Division Performance Improvement 129,968 130,100 Financial Data Analysis 142,761 68,758 Finance, Insurance, Law & Tax 111,212 92,291 383,941 291,149 Commercial Division Regional Events 304,925 189,914 Telecoms & Media 139,435 36,049 Maritime & Commodities 41,319 32,572 485,679 258,535 1,554,351 1,124,529 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following 5 years based on estimated growth rates of between 3 per cent and 6 per cent and a further 15 years based on estimated long-term growth in gross domestic product of 2.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the cash flows in both 2007 and 2006 for all CGUs are between 7 per cent and 10 per cent.
