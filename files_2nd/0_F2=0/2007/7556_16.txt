Contingent liabilities a Relating to the disposal of the UK Retail operations As disclosed at the time of the transactions with MEP Mayflower Limited MEP, the Group was the guarantor on leases in relation to 56 properties which were held by MFI Properties Limited MFI Properties and occupied by the MFI UK Retail operations Retail with rentals being paid by Retail to MFI Properties.
By 29 December 2007, this number had reduced to 50 properties.
The Groups guarantees are triggered if MFI Properties Limited defaults on its obligations under the relevant leases for example because it suffers financial distress.
However, under the terms of the sale of Retail to MEP, MEP have given the Group an indemnity for any costs incurred by the Group in relation to any non-payment by MFI Properties Limited.
The current annual net rentals in respect of these remaining properties total 16.2m, with associated business rates of 7.1m.
Remaining lease terms range between 9 months and 17.9 years from 29 December 2007, with the average lease term being 8.75 years from 29 December 2007.
The Group is not aware that the purchaser or its subsidiaries is in financial distress.
There is uncertainty whether the purchaser or its subsidiaries will ever suffer financial distress and thereby trigger the guarantee, and as to the actual net liability if the Group ever did have to meet the lease obligations, given that the Group would seek to mitigate any liabilities by surrendering or assigning the leases, or by subletting them to third parties.
Because of the nature of the uncertainties, as described above, the Group is unable to give an estimate of the financial effect of this contingent liability.
The Group is also exposed to potential costs in respect of certain warranties and indemnities given by Galiform plc Galiform in favour of MEP in the sale and purchase agreement the SPA relating to the sale of Retail.
One of the warranties given by Galiform relates to the net value of some of the assets and liabilities of MFI on the effective date of the sale 5 August 2006.
Over the course of 2007, MEP has made a number of notifications to Galiform alleging breach of this warranty.
Each notification has been thoroughly investigated by external forensic accountants engaged by the Group.
The Group has strongly rejected MEPs allegations and MEP recently began legal proceedings against Galiform formally claiming breach of the warranty.
Having taken extensive advice from external lawyers and forensic accountants, the Board of Galiform considers that the majority of MEPs total claim is without merit, and MEP has chosen, incorrectly, to ignore a substantial number of offsetting items.
indd 96 26 3 08 10:34:28 Galiform plc Annual Report 2007 To date, MEPs total gross claim amounts to approximately 57m.
However, in light of the advice it has received, the Board is confident of the strength of its case and is firmly of the view that only a small fraction of this amount if any will ultimately be payable.
The Group has made such provision as is considered necessary for the claim.
Because of the uncertainties as to how this matter will progress, the Group is currently unable to give any details as to the expected timing of any resulting payments to MEP, it any.
Under the SPA, MEP may make claims against Galiform for breach of non-tax warranties in the SPA until 18 October 2008 and for breach of tax warranties or any claim under the tax covenant until the sixth anniversary of the end of the accounting period of Retail in which completion of the sale of Retail occurred.
The aggregate liability of Galiform in respect of the warranties that Galiform has given in the SPA and in respect of the tax covenant is capped at 49.6 million other than in the case of fraud or in the case any claims under the warranties relating to title, capacity and authority or claims for secondary tax liabilities, for which, in each case, Galiforms liability is uncapped.
In addition, under the SPA, Galiform agreed to indemnify MEP in respect of certain potential liabilities in relation to pensions, employee transfers, tax, property, and part of the pre-sale reorganisation relating to Retail.
Under IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets, there is an obligation to disclose information about the amount of any provision made.
However, IAS 37 allows a company to omit this disclosure in cases where disclosure would be expected to seriously prejudice the position of the Company in a dispute with other parties on the subject matter of the provision or contingent liability, The Group considers that the provision made by the Group in respect of the claim brought by MEP for breach of the warranty referred to above falls within this expectation, and therefore we are restricting our disclosure accordingly.
b Other guarantees The Group has guaranteed a US$10.0m 2006: US$10.0m letter of credit facility from Standard Chartered Bank in favour of Howden Kitchens Asia Limiteds suppliers.
This contingency would only trigger in the event that Howden Kitchens Asia Limited fails to honour its obligations under the terms of the facility.
Members of the Group have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business.
Should the assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the Group will be liable for those defaults.
The number of claims arising to date has been small and the cost, which is charged to income as it arises, has not been material.
There is a Group VAT registration cross-guarantee under which if one Group company fails to pay its VAT then the other Group companies are jointly and severally liable.
The amount outstanding on this guarantee at the period end is 11.3m 2006: 19.0m.
In February 2006, the Group refinanced its medium-term debt.
The Company, together with other Group companies, has guaranteed the obligations under the new bank facility.
