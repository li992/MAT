46 Notes to the accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies Reporting entity Lonmin Plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The address of the Companys registered office is 4 Grosvenor Place, London, SW1X 7YL.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 30 September 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
Basis of preparation Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 78 to 84.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 14 November 2007.
Basis of measurement The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following: Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value: Financial instruments at fair value through the income statement are measured at fair value: Available for sale assets are measured at fair value: Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements are measured at fair value: and Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
No changes in the accounting policies have had any effect on the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 11 measurement of the recoverable amounts of exploration and mineral assets: Notes 11 and 12 assessment of residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets: Note 15 measurement of defined benefit obligations: Notes 24 and 25 provisions and contingencies: Note 27 measurement of share-based payments: and Note 33 business combinations.
The Group holds a 22% stake in Platmin Limited but has accounted for the entity as an available for sale financial asset as the Group has no representation on the Board of Directors of Platmin Limited and is unable to exert significant influence on the Company.
The Directors consider the carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment to be recoverable.
These have been assessed for impairment based on value in use.
Assessment of value in use has been based on production continuing at current or higher levels and PGM prices being maintained in line with current market expectations.
Impairment reviews have been carried out based on value in use by performing discounted cash flow projections assuming that production levels and sales volumes are in line with most recently published projections for the life of the relevant operation.
In particular, the mines have an expected life in excess of 5 years and hence a discounted cash flow for the full life of the mine is considered appropriate.
A discount rate in line with the weighted average cost of capital for the Group has been used for the calculations.
Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements and have been applied consistently by Group entities.
2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Notes to the accounts 47 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition at which date control commences or up to the effective date of disposal at which date control ceases.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
Associates An associate is an entity in which the Group has an equity interest and over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially measured at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses and equity movements of any associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest including any long-term investments is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Joint ventures The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint ventures.
Joint ventures are established through contractual arrangements that require the unanimous consent of each of the venturers regarding the strategic financial and operating policies of the venture joint control.
The Groups joint ventures are of two types: Jointly controlled entities A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method in the same manner as an investment in associate as described above.
Jointly controlled assets and operations A jointly controlled asset or operation is a joint venture in which the Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
A jointly controlled asset is a joint venture in which the venturers have joint control over the assets contributed or acquired for the purpose of the joint venture.
The Group includes its share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency of the Group entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale equity instruments or qualifying cash hedges which are recognised directly in equity.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Revenue Revenue is derived from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value-added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
This is when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
48 Notes to the accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Finance income and expenses Finance income comprises interest on funds invested including available for sale financial assets, dividend income, gains on the disposal of available for sale financial assets and expected returns on pension scheme assets.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principle outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Groups rights to receive payment have been established.
Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, bank fees, discounting on provisions, unwinding of discount on provisions, impairment losses recognised on financial assets, unwinding of discounting on the convertible bonds, interest costs of pension scheme liabilities and movements in fair value of the embedded derivative on the convertible bonds.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method except for borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset which are capitalised as per IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.
Such costs are capitalised to property, plant and equipment or intangible assets during the period of construction, provided that future economic benefit is considered probable.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received.
Research and development Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure which meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets is capitalised and then amortised over the useful economic life of the developed asset, otherwise it is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses where it can be demonstrated that the expenditure will result in completion of an asset available for use or sale which will result in future economic benefit arising for the Group.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to costs incurred on the exploration for and evaluation of potential mineral reserves and includes costs relating to the following: Acquisition of exploration rights: Conducting geological studies: Exploratory drilling and sampling: and Evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.
Expenditure incurred on activities that precede exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, being all expenditure incurred prior to securing the legal rights to explore an area, is expensed immediately.
Expenditure towards in-house exploration for and evaluation of potential mineral reserves for each area of interest is expensed until it is considered probable that future economic benefit will arise through further exploration and subsequent development of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale.
Pre-feasibility studies involve the review of one or more potential development options with the aim of moving forward to the more detailed feasibility study stage.
Expenditure related to such studies is expensed in full as there is insufficient certainty that future economic benefit will be generated at this stage of a project.
Expenditure relating to feasibility studies which support the technical feasibility and commercial viability of an area is capitalised under exploration and evaluation assets.
Where the feasibility study reaches a favourable conclusion accumulated exploration and evaluation costs are transferred to development assets within property, plant and equipment or intangibles as appropriate on commencement of the development phase of the related project.
Where the feasibility study reaches an adverse conclusion any previously capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is written off immediately.
Expenditure on purchased exploration and evaluation assets is capitalised at fair value at the time of acquisition where due diligence work performed shows what future economic benefit will arise as a result of the acquisition.
Subsequent expenditure may be capitalised at cost.
Carrying values are subject to impairment reviews as per the Groups policy.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is a class of assets which are not available for use, therefore, amortisation is not provided on such assets.
The assets are tested annually for impairment in line with IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is classified as property, plant and equipment or intangible depending on the nature of the expenditure.
Furthermore, mineral mining rights, which are obtained following the completion of a feasibility study, are not included within exploration and evaluation expenditure.
They are capitalised at cost under IAS 38 Intangible Assets and are amortised on a units of production basis over the life of the mine.
2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Notes to the accounts 49 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Share-based payment The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is based on the fair value of the options or shares allocated at the start of the plan and, for those based on market conditions, the number of awards expected to vest.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as a personnel expense in the income statement.
The fair value of each option or share is determined using either a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo projection model, depending on the type of the award.
Market related performance conditions are reflected in the fair value of the share.
Non-market related performance conditions are allowed for using a separate assumption about the number of awards expected to vest: the final charge made reflects the numbers actually vested on the basis that non-market conditions are met.
Business combinations and goodwill At the date of acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking, associate or joint venture fair values are attributed to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Goodwill, which represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the acquired interest in the fair values of those net assets, is capitalised and is subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with the policy set out below.
Goodwill is measured at fair value less accumulated impairment losses.
Any negative goodwill is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
If an undertaking is subsequently sold, the amount of goodwill carried on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is charged to the income statement in the period of disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint ventures which are equity accounted for is included within the Groups investments.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where amortisation is charged on these assets, the expense is taken to the income statement through operating costs.
Amortisation of mineral rights is provided on a units of production basis over the remaining life of mine to residual value 20 to 40 years.
Other intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives subject to a maximum of 20 years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and any other costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located.
Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Borrowing costs incurred on the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset.
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds on disposal with the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net in the income statement.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items major components of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment on a straight-line or units of production basis, as appropriate over the assets expected useful lives or the remaining life of mine, if shorter, to residual value.
The life of mine is based on proven and probable reserves.
The expected useful lives of the major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Method Rate Shafts and underground Units of production 2.5% 5.0% per annum 20 40 years Metallurgical Straight line 2.5% 7.1% per annum 14 40 years Infrastructure Straight line 2.5% 2.9% per annum 35 40 years Other plant and equipment Straight line 2.5% 50.0% per annum 2 40 years No depreciation is provided on surface mining land which has a continuing value.
No depreciation is provided on capital work in progress.
Residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually and, if necessary, changes are accounted for prospectively.
50 Notes to the accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Impairment excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually regardless of whether an indication of impairment exists.
Calculation of recoverable amount Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Reversal of impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a previously recognised impairment loss has reversed.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is only reversed to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, had the change in estimates always applied.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised as income immediately.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Groups Board of Directors for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year or when such events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Impairment losses within a CGU are allocated first to goodwill and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
Leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset as determined at the inception of the lease.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank overdrafts and loans within short-term liabilities.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect the constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Assets held for sale When an assets carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, to take place within 12 months of the balance sheet date, rather than through continuing use, it is classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Immediately prior to sale the assets are remeasured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost which includes the applicable proportion of production overheads and net realisable value.
Platinum Group Metals PGMs stock is valued by allocating costs to Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium stock based on the annual cost of production, less the incremental costs relating to by-products, apportioned according to the quantities of each of the three main metals produced.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of 3 months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as the bank overdraft is repayable on demand and forms an integral part of the Groups cash management.
2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Notes to the accounts 51 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes overseas in accordance with local regulations.
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate legal entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributors to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when they are due.
The Group operates two types of pension schemes in the United Kingdom.
Firstly, there is a defined benefit retirement scheme for which the amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of net assets or liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of the plan assets.
Any recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of providing for the scheme is charged to the income statement over the periods relating to the employees service.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the income statement in retained earnings and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2006.
For UK employees, who do not participate in the above scheme, the Group makes payments in respect of pensions directly to the employees.
These employees have the option to invest in a direct contribution scheme which the Group has set up or they may make their own arrangements.
Taxation Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax to be paid or recovered on the taxable income for the year, using the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date during the periods being reported upon, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax as directed by IAS 12 Income Taxes is recognised in respect of certain temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Groups assets and liabilities and their tax base.
A deferred tax liability is recognised in a business combination in respect of any identified intangible asset representing the difference between the fair value of the acquired asset and its tax base.
Recognition of a deferred tax liability in respect of such a difference gives rise to a corresponding increase in goodwill recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where the entities have the right to settle current tax liabilities net.
Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Rehabilitation costs Rehabilitation costs are provided in full based on estimates of the future costs to be incurred, calculated on a discounted basis.
As the provision is recognised, it is either capitalised as part of the cost of the related mine or written off to the income statement if utilised within one year.
Where costs are capitalised the impact of such costs on the income statement is spread over the life of mine through the accretion of the discount of the provision and the depreciation is provided on a units of production basis of the increased costs of the mining assets.
Provisions Provision is made when a present or legal obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments other than derivatives comprise bank loans, investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables, listed convertible bonds, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and short-term deposits.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through the income statement, any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
These also comprise bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand for the purpose of the cash flow statement only.
Investments are classified into loans and receivables, held to maturity and available for sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired, the nature of the investments and whether the investment is quoted or not.
The classification of investments is determined at initial recognition.
52 Notes to the accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables and investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost and gains or losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Available for sale financial assets The Groups investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available for sale financial assets.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, and foreign exchange gains and losses on available for sale monetary items, are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gains or losses in equity are recycled into the income statement.
Convertible bonds The Group has previously raised debt through the issue of convertible bonds.
These bonds incorporated two key elements.
Firstly, there was the financial liability in respect of the debt element.
This was measured at net present value of future cash flows.
Secondly, the bonds allowed for conversion to equity at the option of the bond holder.
This represented an equity embedded derivative.
However, as the Group retained a cash settlement option, this equity conversion feature was shown as a financial liability if the fair value was greater than the net present value of the debt.
This embedded derivative was fair valued at each reporting period end with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement until the convertible bonds were converted.
Bank loans Bank loans are recorded at amortised cost, net of transaction costs incurred, and are adjusted to amortise transaction costs over the term of the loan.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to manage exposure to market risks from treasury operations and commodity price risks on by-products.
The principal derivative instruments used are foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward price agreements on by-products.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Attributable costs are recognised in the income statement when occurred and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recognised directly in equity, if effective.
Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in either providing products or services business segment or is providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Groups primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments.
The business segments are determined based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms-length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill.
2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Notes to the accounts 53 1 Statement on accounting policies continued New standards and amendments in the year A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 30 September 2007 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and the Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures requires extensive disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for an entitys financial position and financial performance, and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature and extent of risks.
IFRS 7 and amended IAS 1, which become mandatory for the Groups 2008 financial statements, will require extensive additional disclosure with respect to the Groups financial instruments and share capital.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments introduces the management approach to segment reporting.
IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision-Maker in order to assess each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
Currently the Group presents segment information in respect of its business and geographical segments.
Under the management approach, the Group will present segment information in respect of business segments.
Revised IAS 23 Borrowing Costs removes the option to expense borrowing costs and requires that an entity capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset.
The revised IAS 23 will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements.
Currently, the Group has elected to capitalise all borrowing cost to the cost of the asset and, therefore, the change will not impact on the Group.
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions require a share-based payment arrangement in which an entity receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments to be accounted for as equity-settled sharebased payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained.
IFRIC 11 will become mandatory for the Groups 2008 financial statements, with retrospective application required.
It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clarifies when funds or reductions in future contributions in relation to defined benefit assets should be regarded as available and provides guidance on the impact of minimum funding requirements on such assets.
IFRIC 14 will become mandatory for the Groups 2008 financial statements, with retrospective application required.
IFRIC 14 is not expected to have any effect on the consolidated financial statements.
2 Segmental analysis The Groups primary operating segment is the mining of platinum group metals.

These payments were charged to the income statement.
On finalisation of the settlement Lonmin was refunded $3 million.
This has been partially offset by a $1 million provision for the purchase of additional benefits for members of the scheme which was paid in October 2007. iii The Group has carried out a review of non-mining investments in the year resulting in a $5 million impairment charge to the income statement.
iv Capitalised interest in 2006 represents an adjustment to the interest capitalised in previous years.
v The convertible bonds contained an embedded derivative which, because of the cash settlement option, was held at fair value with movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
Fluctuations in fair value were mainly due to share price and were not considered underlying so were reported as special.

Therefore, the relevant standard tax rate for the Group was the South African statutory tax rate of 29% 2006 29%.
The secondary tax rate on dividends remitted by South African companies was 12.5% 2006 12.5%.
i The Group holds a number of available for sale financial assets which are marked to market.
The value of these investments has increased significantly in the period resulting in the recognition of unrealised gains through the statement of recognised income and expense.
This has resulted in the recognition of an associated deferred tax liability except to the extent that there are available losses which, in the opinion of the Directors, can be utilised to offset against such gains.
In these cases a credit is recognised in the income statement as a special item reflecting the associated tax benefit.
$6 million of the credit in the year related to UK taxation.
ii The Group holds both current and deferred tax balances in Rand which is not the reporting currency of the Group.
Given the volatility of the Rand to US$ exchange rate the revaluation of such tax balances can cause significant variations in the tax charge and, therefore, profitability.
Consequently the Directors feel that such foreign exchange impacts should be treated as a special item.

15 Employee benefits Non-current assets The overseas schemes were all defined contribution plans and, in the UK, there was both a defined benefit scheme, the Lonmin Superannuation Scheme the LSS scheme, and a defined contribution scheme.
There were no accrued obligations under defined contribution plans.
The total pension cost for the Group was $33 million 2006 $41 million, $31 million of which related to overseas schemes 2006 $39 million.
The LSS Scheme For the LSS scheme the actuarial valuation was conducted on 30 September 2007 using the following major assumptions: Discount rate 5.8% per annum 2006 5.0% per annum Inflation assumptions 3.4% per annum 2006 3.0% per annum Rate of increase in salaries n a 2006 3.5% per annum Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.03.4% per annum 2006 3.0% per annum Contribution rate in the year 40.8% per annum 2006 25.0% per annum Expected future contribution rate n a 2006 40.8% per annum The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 30 September 2007, used PA 92 c2010 tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for pre-retirement mortality 2006 PA 92 c2010 and PA 92 c2020 for post-retirement mortality 2006 PA 92 c2020.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which have been prepared on a going concern basis and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, are detailed in the table below: 2007 2006 Expected return Expected return %$m %$m Insurance policies 5.8 63 5.0 65 Equities n a 7.6 38 Bonds 5.0 97 4.4 44 Total market value of assets 160 147 Unrecognised assets 25 5 Value of plan assets 135 142 Fair value of scheme liabilities 135 136 Net pension asset 6 The net pension asset shown above for 2006 has been included in the primary statements.
The directors have not recognised assets of the scheme worth $25 million as they do not believe they will be able to derive economic benefit from them in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions.

This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check they are reasonable and appropriate.

2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Notes to the accounts 77 33 Business combinations On 26 January 2007 the Group acquired 94% of AfriOre Limited.
The acquisition was accounted for with an effective date of 1 February 2007 using the acquisition method of accounting.
Since its acquisition AfriOre has only incurred exploration and evaluation expenditure which has been capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
The assets and liabilities of AfriOre Limited and the provisional fair values attributed to these were as follows: Accounting Provisional Provisional Book value policy fair value fair value on acquisition adjustment adjustment 2007 $m $m $m $m Intangible assets 13 13 611 611 Trade and other payables 5 5 Cash and cash equivalents 20 20 Deferred tax liability 173 173 Total assets of acquired entity 28 13 438 453 Minority interest 113 Provisional fair value of assets acquired 340 Goodwill 73 Consideration paid 413 The fair value exercise has, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, recognised the assets of the AfriOre Limited Group at the fair value they would carry if they held tax benefits.
This has resulted in the need to recognise a deferred tax liability of $173 million which, in turn, has caused the creation of a goodwill balance of $73 million.
The fair values assigned have been determined provisionally which is in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
A final review of the fair values will be undertaken prior to 1 February 2008.
The total consideration paid for the acquisition of AfriOre Limited amounted to $413 million comprising cash consideration of $409 million, and expenses on the transaction of $4 million, all paid in the year.
Cash acquired with the entity amounted to $20 million resulting in a net consideration paid of $393 million.
The acquisition has had no material impact on the operating results of the Group for the period.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period it is estimated that some $10 million of exploration and evaluation costs would have been incurred.
In accordance with the Groups policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure this would have been capitalised and the impact on the income statement would have been $nil.
