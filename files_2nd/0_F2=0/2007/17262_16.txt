Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2007 Impairment of long-lived assets 1.
Critical accounting estimates Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of long-lived and judgements assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible fixed assets, relying on a number of factors, including operating results, The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS business plans and projected future cash flows.

The most Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables, the net whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the realisable value of inventory, the impairment of goodwill and carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to long-lived intangible assets, the reserves in respect of self-insured amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes insurance, the consideration received from vendors, taxation and in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be the cost and liability for pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

Future sales are assessed based on historical experience, and adjusted where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue to manufacture the particular item.
To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary significantly.
For example, changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and requiring such inventory to be fully written off.
The Group held allowances in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2007 amounting to 168 million 2006: 134 million.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 73.52 pence 2006: 90.77 pence is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of 474 million 2006: 537 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, of 644 million 2006: 592 million.
As detailed in note 9 below, the Group believes that profit measures before the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements.
Basic earnings per share, before the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table.
2007 2006 Before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 87.80p 98.90p Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles net of deferred tax 14.28 p 8.13 p Basic earnings per share 73.52p 90.77p The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 647 million 2006: 597 million and therefore reduce basic earnings per share to 73.17 pence 2006: 90.02 pence.
Diluted earnings per share before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 87.39 pence 2006: 98.08 pence.
Non-GAAP measures of performance Trading profit is defined as operating profit before the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and is a non-GAAP measure.
The current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 where no amortisation of acquired intangibles was recognised, businesses that have developed organically where no intangibles are attributed and those businesses more recently acquired where amortisation of acquired intangibles is charged.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
The Group uses trading profit, and certain key performance indicators calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to cash generating units CGUs.
These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market ranging from 1 to 4 per cent, and discounted back to present value.
The key assumption is the discount rate, which uses an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital, based on the three month historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates, adjusted for the risk attributable to individual CGUs.
The pre-tax discount rate ranges from 11 to 14 per cent.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2007.
At Stock Building Supply, the US building materials business, revenue and trading profit have been adversely affected by the depressed US housing market and lower lumber and structural panel prices.
The Group has announced branch closures in the midwest region and recognised an impairment loss in the year ended 31 July 2007 in respect of this CGU of 2 million relating to goodwill and 3 million relating to other intangible assets.

All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 650 million 2006: 459 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Groups bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.
Certain interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.

Certain interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings.
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge, and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings.
The ineffective portion was less than 1 million.

The contracts expire between September 2007 and November 2020 2006: September 2006 and November 2020, and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement over that period.
The fixed interest rates vary between 2.313 and 5.415 per cent 2006: 2.313 and 5.415 per cent.
Currency swaps The Group uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge cash flows in respect of committed transactions.
The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.
There were no currency swaps held at fair value through the income statement at 31 July 2007.
At 31 July 2006 the Group had entered into certain short-term currency swaps amounting to assets of US$3 million and liabilities of 2 million which were held at fair value through the income statement.

The weighted average interest rate paid on fixed interest borrowings is 5.0 per cent 2006: 5.0 per cent.
Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
The fair value of fixed interest rate loans payable after one year is 590 million, compared to their book value of 594 million 2006: 621 million compared to their book value of 626 million.
The floating rate loans payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.
Thus the fair value of these instruments approximates to their book value.

Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated.
Included in this provision is an amount of 35 million 2006: 31 million related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies.
This liability is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in Other receivables note 17.
The liability has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2007 based on advice from independent professional advisors.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 5.0 per cent 2006: 5.2 per cent.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Restructuring provisions mainly relate to branch closure programmes at Stock Building Supply, the US building materials business, and at Wolseley UK.
The majority of these obligations fall due within one year.
Other provisions relate to rental commitments on vacant properties, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately five years.
Retirement benefit obligations i Description of schemes United Kingdom The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2007 are either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits that were accruing at that date.
The Group and employee contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
Outside the United Kingdom North America The principal scheme operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing schemes.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2007 the cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was 24 million 2006: 23 million.
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
Two of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded: two schemes are closed to new entrants.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
The closed schemes now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme.
The remaining schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
Europe Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was 15 million 2006: 5 million.
98 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Post-retirement healthcare There are no material obligations to provide post-retirement healthcare benefits.
The Group expects to contribute 26 million to the UK defined benefit scheme in the year ending 31 July 2008 and 8 million to the non-UK defined benefit schemes.

To reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long-term rates of return on equities include a risk premium.
These risk premiums are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by listed companies.
The expected long-term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, i. e. by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
For the principal UK scheme a premium of 3.0 per cent per year as at 31 July 2007 2006: 3.0 per cent was applied to the expected return from government bonds.
For the principal overseas schemes in USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups investment strategy for its funded post employment schemes is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees of the schemes, and takes account of relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long-term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post employment schemes being lower over the long-term and be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
100 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 For the principal UK scheme the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities, and 25 per cent in other asset classes, principally bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group.
For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

102 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Employee Benefit Trusts Three Employee Benefit Trusts have been established in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme.
During the year, one of these trusts purchased 2,188,522 ordinary shares of the Company, with a nominal value of 1 million, for a cash consideration of 27 million.
The market value of the 6,200,000 shares held by the employee benefit trusts at 31 July 2007, which have a nominal value of 2 million, was 67 million 2006: 46 million and none of them had been allocated to employees or Directors at that date.

Share-based payments The Group operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 collectively, the Executive Option Schemes : the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1981, the Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2000 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 collectively, the Employees Savings Option Schemes : and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 the ESPP.
The Wolseley Employees International Stock Appreciation Plan the SAP expired during the year ended 31 July 2006.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years.
Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years.
Awards granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan vest over a one year period.
Awards granted under the SAP vested over a period of five years.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan RSP for senior executives.
Under the LTIS, executives will be awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies.
The vesting period is three years.
The maximum award under the scheme is determined at grant date, and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition.
Under the RSP, executives are granted free shares.
The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures.

The fair value of shares granted under the RSP was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Executive Employee Long Term Share Options Share Options Incentive Schemes 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate 4.78% 4.45% 5.34% 4.52% 4.98% 4.40% Expected annual increase in dividends 10% 10% 10% 10% Expected dividend yield 2.6% 2.75% Expected volatility 27.07% 39.00% 24.94% 31.06% 22.00% 20.58% Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1-7 years 1-7 years 3 years 3 years The initial assumption was for 2007 interim and final dividends of 10.84 pence and 21.51 pence respectively 2006: 9.68 pence and 19.36 pence respectively.
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

When rights vested under the stock appreciation plans, the parent company issued shares to the trust, which then sold them in the market.
From the Groups point of view, shareholders equity only increased by the proportion of the sale proceeds attributable to the original exercise price of the award, while the trust remitted the remaining amount to employees.
The parent company, however, is required by the UK Companies Act to credit the full issue proceeds to share capital and share premium account, and consequently the proportion of the issue proceeds remitted to employees is accounted for as a capitalisation of distributable reserves.

Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgmental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group has gained access, and to additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed 2,067 million to revenue, 132 million to trading profit and 80 million to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax, as the Group manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.
It is not practicable to disclose profit attributable to equity shareholders, as the complexity of the Groups tax arrangements is such that it cannot attribute an effective tax rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been 16,774 million and Group trading profit would have been 930 million.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, as stated above.
It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would have been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2007 or later periods, but which the Group has not early adopted.
The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Groups operations are as follows: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 August 2007 and amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures effective from 1 August 2007 IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital and how it manages capital.
Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating segments effective from 1 August 2009 This IFRS specifies how an entity should report information about its operating segments in its financial statements.
Generally, financial information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 8 on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective from 1 August 2009 This amendment requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs, to the extent they are directly attributable to the acquisition, production or construction of assets that need a period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements effective from 1 August 2009 This amendment requires information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and introduces a statement of comprehensive income.
Preparers will have the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements a separate income statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 109 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2007 IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions effective from 1 August 2007 IFRIC 11 provides guidance on the application of IFRS 2 Share-based payments to transactions which are settled by the purchase of own shares, and transactions in which employees of a subsidiary receive rights to shares of a parent company.
Management does not expect adoption of this interpretation to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements effective from 1 August 2008 IFRIC 12 clarifies how certain aspects of existing IASB literature are to be applied to service concession arrangements, which are arrangements whereby a government or other body grants contracts for the supply of public services such as roads, energy distribution, prisons or hospitals to private operators.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes effective from 1 August 2008 IFRIC 13 addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits to customers who buy other goods or services.
It requires the award to be accounted for as a separate component of the sale transaction, with the fair value of the award being deferred until the obligation to provide free or discounted goods or services has been redeemed.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this interpretation on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective from 1 August 2008 Paragraph 58 of IAS 19 Employee Benefits limits the measurement of the defined benefit asset in a pension plan to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
IFRIC 14 clarifies how to measure this limit in the case of plans subject to a minimum funding requirement.
