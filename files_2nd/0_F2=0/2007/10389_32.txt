Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs in the following business segments, which is how goodwill is monitored by the Group internally.
2007 2006 m m Facilities Services 130.7 126.8 Property Services 5.6 5.4 Engineering Services 12.1 11.6 148.4 143.8 The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are as follows: 2007 2006 % % Facilities Services 9.2 8.0 Property Services 9.2 8.0 Engineering Services 9.2 8.0 64 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
