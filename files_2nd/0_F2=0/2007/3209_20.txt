Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Company Balance Sheet i.
Principal accounting policies of the Company Accounting principles The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under the historical cost convention and the Companies Act 1985.
Basis of preparation No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 3 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Companys profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2007 was 5 million 2006: 1,939 million.
Employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Directors Report Corporate Responsibility Review on page 32, the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 45 and in note 33, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-marketbased vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: LTIS: awards up to 2005 A Black-Scholes valuation augmented by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance LTIS: after 2005 EPS awards Market value on the date of grant LTIS: after 2005 TSR awards A Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance Sharesave Black-Scholes ESOS Black-Scholes using an adjusted option life assumption to reflect the possibility of early exercise SAS, SIP, DMSS and RSS Market value on the date of grant Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives at periods ranging from three to 20 years.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Investments Fixed asset investments are held in the Balance Sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Companys employees participate in a number of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 34 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The charge to the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit schemes of the Group accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies detailed in note 2 to the Group Financial Statements can be found in note 34 to the Group Financial Statements.

Principal accounting policies of the Company continued Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless, by the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
