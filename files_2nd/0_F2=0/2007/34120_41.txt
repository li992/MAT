Equity-settled share option plans The Group granted options to employees under Approved and Unapproved Inland Revenue Share option schemes between 16 November 1999 and 11 November 2003.
The Groups schemes provided for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is three to ten years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Since 3 September 2004 the Group has operated an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE which allows any employee who has more than six months service to purchase shares at a 20% discount to the average quoted market price of the group shares at the date of grant.

The scheme is administered by Yorkshire Building Society.
