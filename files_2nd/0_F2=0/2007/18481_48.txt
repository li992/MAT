notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 January 31 December.
Contingent liabilities continued Outsourcing of IT The Group has an IT outsourcing agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation CSC running until 2015.
The Groups contractual obligations related to the agreement at 31 December 2007 amounted to approximately DKK 75 million 31 December 2006, DKK 288 million.
The decrease in the obligation from 2006 to 2007 is due to contract negotiations which at year end 2006 was estimated to reduce the obligation by at least DKK 160 million.
The final decrease in the obligation as a result of the negotiations was DKK 213 million.
Divestments The Group makes provisions for claims from purchasers or other parties in connection with divestments and representations and warranties given in relation to such divestments.
Management believes that provisions made at 31 December 2007 are adequate.
However, there can be no assurance that one or more major claims arising out of the Groups divestment of companies will not adversely affect the Groups activities, results of operations and financial position.
legal proceedings The Group is party to certain legal proceedings.
Management believes that these proceedings which are to a large extent labour cases incidental to its business will not have a material impact on the Groups financial position beyond the assets and liabilities already recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2007.
31. financial risk management and derivatives The Groups financial risk management is based on policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group may use derivatives to hedge financial risks.
Hedging of financial risks is managed at corporate level and is only focused on managing risks arising from the Groups operation and financing.
It is not group policy to take positions in the financial markets.
Currency risk The service industry is characterised by a relatively low level of transaction risk, since the services are produced and delivered in the same local currency with minimal exposure from imported components.
However, fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the Group to the extent that its interest payments with respect to borrowings are not denominated in the same currencies as the Groups revenue.
In addition, currency movements may materially affect the economic environment in which the Groups subsidiaries operate, which could have an adverse effect on the Groups business, results of operations and financial condition.
Further, currency fluctuations may have a significant effect on the value of royalties, dividends and service fees paid in local currency by the Groups subsidiaries.
The main currency exposure relates to the risk involved in translating the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into Danish kroner based on average exchange rates for the year and in relation to the risk of translating the equity and intercompany loans in foreign subsidiaries into Danish kroner based on year-end exchange rates.
It is not Group policy to hedge the currency exposure on foreign investments.
However, the Group may choose to hedge the currency exposure on foreign investments by funding such investments in local currencies or entering into hedging transactions.
The internal bank, ISS Global A S, hedges the exposure on the intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries by entering into currency swaps.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from both the intercompany loans and currency swaps are recognised in the income statement.
In 2007, the currencies in which the Groups revenue was denominated decreased with an average of 0.3% 2006: increased with 0.1% relative to Danish kroner, decreasing the Groups revenue by DKK 160 million 2006: increasing the Groups revenue by DKK 58 million.
Currency movements affected the operating profit before other items by a decrease of DKK 10 million 2006: an increase of DKK 3 million.
The effect of the translation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries decreased equity by DKK 264 million 2006: decreased equity by DKK 103 million, net of hedges.

Amounts in DKK millions 31. financial risk management and derivatives continued Based on the actual 2007 figures, the effect of a 5% change in foreign exchange rates of the Groups main currencies is shown in the table below: Operating Net assets profit before in foreign Currency Revenue other items subsidiaries EUR 1,468 93 516 CHF 111 9 51 GBP 390 26 114 NOK 266 19 39 SEK 193 13 30 USD 138 8 47 Other 431 28 103 Total 2,997 196 900 Interest rate risk Rising in interest rates increase the Groups interest expenses relating to variable rate indebtedness, and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt.
In addition, increases in interest rates increase the funding cost of acquisitions, thereby limiting the Groups ability to grow through acquisitions on a cost-effective basis, as well as limiting the Groups ability to implement its growth strategy.
Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and the Groups ability to service its debt.
The interest rate risk is measured by the duration of the net debt.
The duration reflects the effect of a simultaneous increase or decrease in the general level of interest rates for the currencies included in the debt portfolio.
As at 31 December 2007, the duration of net debt was approximately 2.8 years 31 December 2006: 4.3 years.
A decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value of the debt but only part of this increase will be reflected in the income statement and equity as long-term borrowings are stated at amortised cost and therefore not adjusted to fair value.
The interest rate swaps hedging the floating interest rate are adjusted to fair value and recognised directly in equity.
Based on the net debt and taking into account the effect of hedging instruments as at 31 December 2007, a general decrease increase of one percentage point in relevant interest rates would reduce increase the annual net interest expense by approximately DKK 54 million 2006: DKK 34 million, all other things being equal.
The Groups loan portfolio primarily consists of senior facilities, bonds issued under the EMTN programme, second lien facility and subordinated notes.
A part of the interest payments on the bank loans and a part of the interest payments on the second lien have been swapped from floating into fixed rates see note 25, Long-term debt.
To manage the duration of the net debt, the Group applies derivatives, such as interest rate swaps.
The deferred gain or loss on the interest rate instruments will be recognised directly in equity, net of tax.
On realisation of the hedged item, value changes recognised under equity are reversed and recognised together with the hedged item.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised but the hedged future transactions are still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.

It is a part of the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate level of liquid reserve.
Credit risk Credit risk represents the risk of the accounting loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to perform as contracted.
The Group is not exposed to significant risks relating to individual customers or counterparties and losses on bad debt relating to individual customers or counterparties have historically been relatively low.
The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of the Groups counterparties in order to reduce the credit risk exposure.
It is group policy that financial transactions may be entered into only with financial institutions with a high credit rating.
Capital management The Group monitors the need for adjustment of the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
The dividend policy and the payment of dividends is made subject to the necessary consolidation of equity and the Groups continuing expansion.
ISS Holding A S and its subsidiaries have and will continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and obligations with respect to the servicing of such indebtedness.
ISS Holding A S is a holding company, and its primary assets consist of shares in ISS A S and cash in its bank accounts.
ISS Holding A S has no revenue generating operations of its own, and therefore ISS Holding A Ss cash flow and ability to service its indebtedness, will depend primarily on the operating performance and financial condition of ISS A S and its operating subsidiaries, and the receipt by ISS Holding A S of funds from ISS A S and its subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise.
The operating performance and financial condition of ISS A S and its operating subsidiaries and the ability of ISS A S and its subsidiaries to provide ISS Holding A S with funds by way of dividends or otherwise will in turn depend, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market and other factors, many of which are beyond ISS Holding A Ss control.

Amounts in DKK millions 31. financial risk management and derivatives continued The senior facilities, the second lien facilities and the subordinated notes contain covenants that restrict ISS Holding A S and its subsidiaries from making distributions or other payments to creditors unless certain financial tests and other criteria are satisfied.
The terms of other agreements to which ISS Holding A S and its subsidiaries may be or become subject to may also restrict the ability of its subsidiaries to provide ISS Holding A S with funds.
In addition, ISS Holding A S and its subsidiaries may incur other debt in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those contained in the senior facilities or the subordinated notes.
In particular, certain of ISS Holding A Ss subsidiaries may establish working capital or similar debt facilities permitted under the terms of the senior facilities and the subordinated notes that contain such restrictions.
The covenants could materially and adversely affect the Groups ability to finance the future operations or capital needs of ISS Holding A S or its subsidiaries or to engage in other business activities that may be in the best interest of ISS Holding A S or its subsidiaries.
If ISS Holding A S, or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, does not comply with the covenants including financial tests and restrictions of the senior facilities, the Euro Medium Term Notes, the second lien facilities or the subordinated notes and any future new credit facilities, the Group could be in default under those agreements, and the debt incurred under those agreements, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable.
If a default occurs under the senior facilities, the Euro Medium Term Notes, the second lien facilities or the subordinated notes, the lenders under such indebtedness could, subject to restrictions on enforcement rights, cause all the outstanding debt obligations thereunder to become due and payable, thereby requiring the Group to apply cash to repay the debt thereunder and or prevent it from making debt service payments on its other debt.
In addition, any default under the senior facilities, the Euro Medium Term Notes, the second lien facilities or the subordinated notes could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions.
If the debt under the senior facilities, the Euro Medium Term Notes, the second lien facilities, the subordinated notes or other debt instruments is accelerated, the Group may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due thereunder.
The Groups ability to comply with the provisions of the senior facilities, the Euro Medium Term Notes, the second lien facilities, the subordinated notes and agreements governing its other debt may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond its control.
In 2010, EUR 850 million of the Euro Medium Term Notes of ISS Global A S will mature and approximately EUR 110 million of the Euro Medium Term Notes of ISS Global A S will mature in 2014.
In addition, the senior facilities will mature in 2012 and 2013, and EUR 600 million of second lien facilities and EUR 454 million of subordinated notes will mature in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
The Group intends to repay the principal amount of such indebtedness and the principal amount of the notes at maturity using funds obtained from other financing sources, rather than with cash from operations.
Although the Group expects to be able to raise funds to repay such indebtedness as it matures, and to repay the principal amount of the notes and the facilities at their maturity, through the use of other sources of indebtedness, it may not be able to do so on terms as favourable as its existing indebtedness, if at all.
The failure to pay the principal amount of this indebtedness at maturity would constitute an event of default under such indebtedness and would result in a cross default under the Groups other financing arrangements.
