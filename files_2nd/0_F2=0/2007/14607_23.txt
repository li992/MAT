Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of Speedy Hire Plc and also certain central activities.
These are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the Groups activities is undertaken at head office level and consequently net financing costs cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets comprise principally computer and information systems, working capital balances held by the Support Services function and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and are not directly attributable to the activities of the segments.
Acquisitions made during the year have been successfully integrated into the Speedy Hire network and are performing in line with forecast.
A number of depots acquired are close to, or have been merged with, existing outlets, and as a result it is difficult to assess the impact of acquisitions on the business.
Revenue and operating profit from 20067 acquisitions are estimated to have contributed 36.2m and 5.2m respectively, all of which is attributable to the Equipment division.
