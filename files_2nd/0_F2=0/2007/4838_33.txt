Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation Tax laws that apply to the Groups businesses may be amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities.
Such potential amendments and their application to the Group are regularly monitored and the requirement for recognition of any liabilities assessed where necessary.
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of different jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the appropriate provision for transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
In such circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for anticipated taxes due based on best information available and where the anticipated liability is probable and estimable.
Where the final outcome of such matters differs from the amounts initially recorded, any differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period to which such determination is made.
Where the potential liabilities are not considered probable, the amount at risk is disclosed unless an adverse outcome is considered remote.
1.20 New accounting standards and interpretations During the period, the following new standards which are applicable to the Group were published, but do not become effective until future accounting periods: IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the associated amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures.
IFRS 7 replaces IAS 32 and introduces new disclosures to increase information provided about financial instruments including additional disclosures about exposure to risks including sensitivity analysis.
The Group will apply IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 from 29 April 2007: and IFRS 8, Operating segments.
IFRS 8 adopts a management approach to segmental reporting requiring the identification of operating segments based on internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker and extends the scope and disclosure requirements of IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.
It is effective for periods beginning on or after January 2009.
The adoption of IFRS 8 will have no impact on the net results or net assets of the Group.
Certain interpretations were issued during the period which either do not apply to the Group or are not expected to have any material effect.
