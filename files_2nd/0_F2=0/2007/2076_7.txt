Key information continued 1.6 Forward looking statements This Annual Report contains forward looking statements, including statements regarding: estimated reserves trends in commodity prices demand for commodities plans, strategies and objectives of management closure or divestment of certain operations or facilities including associated costs anticipated production or construction commencement dates expected costs or production output anticipated productive lives of projects, mines and facilities provisions and contingent liabilities.
Forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as intend, aim, project, anticipate, estimate, plan, believe, expect, may, should, will, continue or similar words.
These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of operations or financial condition, or provide other forward looking statements.
These forward looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this Annual Report.
For example, our future revenues from our operations, projects or mines described in this Annual Report will be based, in part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which may vary significantly from current levels.
These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project or the expansion of certain facilities or mines.
Other factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or production output and anticipated lives of operations, mines or facilities include our ability to profitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and or metals extracted to applicable markets: the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce: activities of government authorities in some of the countries where we are exploring or developing these projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes, changes in environmental and other regulations and political uncertainty: and other factors identified in the description of the risk factors above.
We cannot assure you that our estimated economically recoverable reserve figures, closure or divestment of such operations or facilities, including associated costs, actual production or commencement dates, cost or production output or anticipated lives of the projects, mines and facilities discussed in this Annual Report, will not differ materially from the statements contained in this Annual Report.
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.
