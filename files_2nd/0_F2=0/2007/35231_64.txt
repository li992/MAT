This was the closing market price of the companys 5p ordinary shares on 31st January 2007.
This issue price consists of the nominal value of the ordinary shares of 0.05 and a share premium of 19.41.
Directly attributable acquisition costs are those charged by the companys advisers in performing due diligence activities and producing the acquisition documents.
The net assets acquired at 1st February 2007 were: Book value Fair value of net assets of net assets acquired acquired m m Non-current assets Investment property 1,245.6 1,245.6 Property, plant and equipment 53.9 54.7 Investments 18.0 17.5 Pension scheme surplus 1.4 1.4 Deferred tax asset 12.0 12.0 Derivatives 6.1 6.1 Other receivables 6.2 6.2 1,343.2 1,343.5 Current assets Trading property 1.3 9.4 Trade and other receivables 9.4 8.8 Cash and cash equivalents 13.9 13.9 24.6 32.1 Total assets 1,367.8 1,375.6 Current liabilities Bank loans 4.6 4.6 Trade and other payables 39.8 40.9 44.4 45.5 Non-current liabilities Borrowings 480.4 510.6 Deferred tax liability 148.8 144.4 Other 6.8 6.8 636.0 661.8 Total liabilities 680.4 707.3 Net assets acquired 687.4 668.3 Minority interests 56.0 56.0 Groups interest in the total net assets acquired 631.4 612.3 Goodwill on acquisition 353.3 Cost of acquisition 965.6 The goodwill on acquisition disclosed above differs from that in the interim results of 297.3m due to an amendment to the treatment of minority interests on consolidation.
Adjustments from book value to fair value include those arising from the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment, trading property and debt.
Adjustments arising from the application of Derwent Londons accounting policies have been made to the book value figures.
N otes to the financial statements 22 Acquisition of subsidiaries continued At the date of publishing the 2006 year end report and accounts, work was still outstanding on the fair value verification exercise.
This has now been completed and a number of amendments were identified to both book and fair value.
A detailed review of the existence of intangible assets, other than goodwill, has already been concluded, and none were found to have any material value.
An impairment test has been carried out on the goodwill arising on the acquisition.
The properties acquired on the acquisition of LMS complement the existing portfolio of properties held by the group.
It is anticipated that, in future, the group will be capable of deriving significantly enhanced cashflows from the acquired portfolio due to future lease management, refurbishment and redevelopment, which are proposed to be made to the acquired property portfolio.
While the amount that the group has paid for LMS is justified by these anticipated enhancements and benefits that will be brought to the group, IAS 36, Impairment of Assets does not permit such enhancements to be included in the cashflows used in estimating value in use for the purposes of impairment testing, and instead requires the cashflows to be based on the assets in their current condition.
In addition, the benefits arising from the acquired portfolio are specific to the group and, consequently, the fair value, less costs to sell, of the acquired business does not support the carrying amount of the goodwill associated with the acquisition.
As a consequence, the goodwill associated with this transaction is deemed to be fully impaired and has been written off to the group income statement.
If the date for this acquisition had been 1st January 2007, then the group property income would have increased by 4.6m.
As the fair value adjustments and adjustments arising from the application of Derwent Londons accounting policies made above have not been made to the results of London Merchant Securities for 31st December 2006 it is impractical to assess the impact on the profit for the year arising from a 1st January 2007 acquisition date.
The profit for the year ended 31st December 2007 of 100.9m, which is after recognising the 353.3m of goodwill impairment, includes post acquisition profits of 203.0m for London Merchant Securities.
Year ended 31st December 2006 The whole of the issued share capital of Bramley Road Limited, a property investment company, was acquired on 4th October 2006 for a total cost of 6.2m.
The net assets acquired on 4th October 2006 were: Book value of net Fair value of net assets acquired assets acquired m m Non-current assets Investment property 8.6 8.6 Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 0.2 0.2 Current liabilities Trade payables 0.1 0.1 Non-current liabilities Financial liabilities 0.7 0.7 Deferred tax liabilities 1.8 1.8 Net assets acquired 6.2 6.2 Goodwill on acquisition Cost of acquisition 6.2 The cost of this acquisition was settled 100% in cash, paid from the companys existing bank facilities.
In relation to the acquisition of Bramley Road Limited, post acquisition profit of 0.2m was recognised in the profit for the year ended 31st December 2006.
If the acquisition date for this business combination had been 1st January 2006, the property income of the combined entity would have increased by 0.4m to 51.7m.
As the investment property owned by Bramley Road Limited was not professionally valued at 31st December 2005 it is impracticable to state the potential effect on the profit for the year.
