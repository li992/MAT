Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 16.
Financial liabilities continued As at 31 December 2007 a 10% increase in Sterling against the US Dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 49.4 million 2006: 13.8 million and a 10% decrease in Sterling against US Dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 60.3 million 2006: 16.8 million.
Liquidity risk The Group manages the liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cashflow projections, supplemented by maintaining debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The Group considers the carrying value of all the financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as the fair value.
Fair values of derivative instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet with changes in such fair value between accounting periods being recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cashflow or fair value hedges.
The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices marked-to-market values where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: One to three Total One to three Total Less than Less than years years one year 2007 one year 2006 Assets liabilities : 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cashflow hedges Gas derivatives 7,573 13,489 21,062 33,397 12,217 45,614 Oil derivatives 81,832 55,046 136,878 23,309 49,373 72,682 Interest rate derivatives 104 104 88 68 156 89,509 68,535 158,044 10,176 37,088 26,912 Fair value through profit and loss Exchange rate derivatives 5,889 5,889 89,509 68,535 158,044 16,065 37,088 21,023 Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Oil and gas prices The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated and D-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2007 the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2008 H2 2008 2009 2010 2011 Volume bopd 20,600 18,000 11,000 2,000 Average Price $ bbl 70.60 70.30 62.43 83.40 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2007 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.

As at 31 December 2007 all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis on oil and ratio analysis on gas.
There is, however, a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arise from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
Income statement hedge summary The changes in the fair value of hedges which are required to be recognised immediately in the Income Statement for the year, were as follows: 2007 2006 Loss gain on hedging instruments: 000 000 Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives Ineffectiveness 533 422 Time Value 9,989 809 10,522 387 Oil derivatives Ineffectiveness 2,380 8,308 Time Value 10,476 1,891 12,856 10,199 Fair value through profit and loss Foreign exchange derivatives 5,889 5,889 Total net loss gain for the year in Income Statement 29,267 15,701 The following table summarises the deferred gains losses on derivative instruments, net of tax effects, recorded in hedge reserve note 23 for the year: 2007 2006 Deferred amounts in hedge reserve 000 000 At 1 January 52,213 120,449 Amounts recognised in profit for the year 23,917 13,255 Deferred losses gains before tax arising during the year 133,615 122,625 Deferred tax movement taken directly to equity 29,918 41,134 79,780 68,236 At 31 December 131,993 52,213 89 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 17.
Financial instruments continued 2007 2006 Deferred amounts in hedge reserve net of tax effects 000 000 Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives 7,191 21,556 Oil derivatives 124,706 73,878 Interest rate derivatives 96 109 131,993 52,213 Financial derivatives The Group internally measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses, including utilizing 10% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
Oil and gas sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being Dated Brent oil prices and UK D-1 Heren natural gas prices.
The sensitivity analysis, which is used internally by management to monitor financial derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: the pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark to market MTM evaluations: the price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges: and the sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material component of the MTM oil and gas hedges.
As at 31 December 2007 a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity by approximately 49 million 2006: 15 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately 43 million 2006: 17 million.
As at 31 December 2007 a 10% increase in the UK, D-1 Heren natural gas price curve would have decreased equity by approximately 14 million 2006: 9 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately 12 million 2006: 11 million.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2007, the interest rate derivative position was out-of-the-money to an amount of 104,000 2006: 156,000 and due to immateriality no sensitivity analysis has been performed on the position.
FX sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2007, there were no foreign exchange derivatives outstanding.
As at 31 December 2006, a 10% weakening of the AUD to the USD would have reduced equity and profit for the year by approximately 15 million and 10% strengthening of the AUD to the USD would have increased equity and profit for the year by approximately 17 million.
Interest rate sensitivity A 10% relative change in LIBOR would have impacted equity and profit for the year by -3.0 million 2006: -1.2 million.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their credit worthiness after transactions have been initiated.
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics, as at present the majority of the oil and gas derivative positions of the group are out-of-the-money.
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
