Return of capital On 14 November, the Group announced its intention to return approximately 120 million of capital to shareholders by way of a B share issue combined with a consolidation of Amlins existing shares on the basis of 8 new ordinary shares for 9 existing ones.
This was subsequently approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 12 December 2007.
B shares were issued on 17 December 2007 to existing shareholders on the basis of one B share for each ordinary share held on 14 December 2007.
Each B share enabled the shareholder to redeem the share at 22.4 pence per share at various dates in the future up to August 2009 or alternatively to receive a B share initial dividend in January 2008 of 22.4 pence per share.
Following such dividend receipt, the relevant B shares were converted into deferred shares which were themselves redeemed on 14 January 2008 for a total redemption value of one penny in all.
Holders of B shares not redeemed or converted into deferred shares on or around the initial redemption date in January 2008 have the right, subject to the Company having profits available for distibutiion, to receive continuing dividends at the rate of 75% of the sterling six month LIBOR.
The B shares have no right to vote at general meetings of the Company other than to wind up the Company.
They are fully transferable but are not listed on any stock exchange.
The amount outstanding to be returned to B shareholders at 31 December 2007 has been recognised as a liability in note 25.
The total cost of the issue including expenses was 120.4 million which has been charged against share premium.

The market value of Amlin plc ordinary shares at 31 December 2007 was 298.0p per share 2006: 325.25p.
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements.
The ESOT waives the right to dividends on ordinary shares in excess of 0.01p per each share ranking for an interim or final dividend.
The weighted average share price of Amlin plc throughout the year was 305.42 pence 2006: 269.9 pence.
The Black Scholes option pricing model has been used to determine the fair value of the option grants listed above.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 201.78 185.43p Weighted average exercise price 183.37 159.02p Expected volatility 30.00% 30.00% Expected life years 3.25 7.50 3.25 7.50 Risk free rate of return 4.30% 5.00% 4.30% 4.50% Expected dividend yield 2.00% 5.00% 2.00% 5.00% Volatility The volatility of the Amlin share price is calculated as a normalised standard deviation of the log of the daily return on the share price.
In estimating a 30% volatility, the volatility of return for six months, one year and three year intervals are considered.
As a guide to the reasonableness of the volatility estimate similar calculations are performed on a selection of Amlins peer group.
Interest rate The risk free interest rate is consistent with government bond yields.
Dividend yield The assumptions are consistent with the information given in the report and accounts for each relevant valuation year.
Staff turnover The option pricing calculations are split by staffing grades as staff turnover is higher for more junior grades.
Furthermore historical evidence suggests that senior employees tend to hold their options for longer whereas more junior levels within the organisation appear to exercise earlier.
In addition senior employees hold a larger proportion of the options but represent a smaller group of individuals.
Market conditions Amlin issues options that include targets for the Groups performance against a number of market and non-market conditions.
Failure to meet these targets can reduce the number of options exercisable.
In some circumstances no options may be exercised.
Assumptions are made about the likelihood of meeting the market and non-market conditions based on the outlook at the time of each option grant.
