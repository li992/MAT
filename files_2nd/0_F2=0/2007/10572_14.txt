qxd 28 2 08 20:54 Page 56 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2007 Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued Leased assets a Finance leases Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance lease assets are recognised as assets of the Group at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
Subsequent to recognition, finance lease assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The lease liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease liability.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of lease liabilities so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
b Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Retirement benefit schemes a Defined contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is a post-retirement benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
The Group recognises payments to defined contribution pension plans as an employee expense in the income statement as and when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction on future payments is available.
b Defined benefit pension plans A defined benefit plan is a post-retirement plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net liability is recognised in the balance sheet and is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods and discounting this to its present value.
Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of the plans assets are deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.
The cost of the scheme is charged to the income statement based on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the financial year.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the net of the total unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Where the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
Net pension obligations are included in the balance sheet at the present value of the scheme liabilities, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
Share based payments The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period from date of grant to the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Cash-settled share based payments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date and recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period from date of grant to the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the payment.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as an employee expense in the income statement.
Fair value is measured by use of a modified Black-Scholes model.
None of these awards when granted was subject to a share price related performance condition.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
qxd 28 2 08 20:54 Page 57 Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are used in joint ventures to hedge long-term floating interest rate and retail price index risks.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, interest rate swaps are stated in the balance sheet at fair value.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Where financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed to be effective, gains and losses on re-measurement relating to the effective portion are recognised in equity, the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Note 27 contains details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedged purposes.
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are also detailed in note 22.
Financial receivables Certain joint ventures financial receivables are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows directly associated with the financial receivables at a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The change in fair value is recognised in equity.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced.
For loans and receivables the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision for impairment losses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the provision.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance are recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement to the extent the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.

The average credit period on revenues is 23 days 2006: 25 days.
No interest is charged on the trade receivables outstanding balance.
Trade receivables overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 57.3m 2006: 37.8m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group believes that the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 134 days 2006: 116 days.
The Groups exposure to credit risks and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 27, Financial Instruments.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and spread across the Groups operating segments.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for impairment losses.
Within the provision for impairment losses there are no specific trade receivables 2006: nil which have been placed under liquidation.
No collateral is held by the Group as security.
At the reporting date there were no trade and other receivables which have had renegotiated terms that would otherwise have been past due.

Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are stated at cost plus the profit attributable to that contract, less any impairment losses.
Progress payments for construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable.
Payments in advance on construction contracts represent amounts received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction contracts.
At 31 December 2007 retentions held by customers for contract work amounted to 66.2m 2006: 41.7m.

The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustees of the Plan.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 6.1m 2006: 4.8m represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Plan by the Group.
As at 31 December 2007, contributions of 0.6m 2006: 0.4m were due in respect of December 2007s contribution not paid over to the Plan.
Defined benefits scheme The Plan includes some defined benefit liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit rights of active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group.
These include salary related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995 and benefits transferred in from The Snape Group Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme include accruals up to 1 August 1997.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after those dates.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities was as at 31 December 2007.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit method.
Key assumptions used: 2007 2006 % % Discount rate 6.0 5.3 Expected return on the Plan assets 5.3 6.0 Expected rate of salary increases 4.5 4.1 Future pension increases 3.5 3.1 Inflation increases 3.5 3.1 Life expectancy: Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in the UK.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2007 2006 Male 86.9 84.0 Female 89.8 86.9 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, twenty years after the balance sheet date is as follows: 2007 2006 Male 88.0 84.0 Female 90.8 86.9 69 2007 ACCOUNTS ART.

The value of current and future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.
For the disclosures as at 31 December 2007, the PXA92 series of tables from the Continuous Mortality Investigation were adopted appropriate to members actual years of birth and with a medium cohort projection for future improvements in life expectancy.
An increase of 1 year to the average life expectancy at 65 would increase the value of the defined benefit obligation by around 2.5%.
If such an assumption had been adopted as at 31 December 2007, the defined benefit obligation would have increased to 8.2m 2006: increase of 3% with the defined benefit obligation increasing from 7.3m to 7.6m.

General risk management principles The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal risk assessment and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic operational and financial risks of the Group is in place to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations.
Internal control and risk management systems are embedded in the operations of the divisions.
The key business risks identified are discussed in detail in the business review on pages 4 to 17 and the corporate governance statement on page 43.
Financial risks and management The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations.
Risk management is governed by the Groups operational policies, which are subject to periodic review by the Groups internal audit team and annual review by management.
The policies include written principles for the overall management of the Groups risk management as well as specific policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures in respect of specific risk mitigation techniques such as the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The following represent the key financial risks resulting from the Groups use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk.
a Credit risk: Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and results primarily from the Groups trade receivables and amounts recoverable on construction contracts.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts AROC and trade receivables The Groups primary exposure to credit risk arises from the potential for non-payment or default from construction contract debtors and trade receivables.
The degree to which the Group is exposed to this credit risk depends on the individual characteristics of the contract counterparty and the nature of the project.
The Groups credit risk is also influenced by the general macroeconomic conditions of the United Kingdom.
The Group primarily operates in one geographical segment, being the United Kingdom.
The Group does not have any concentration risk in respect of AROC or trade receivables balances at the reporting date with both receivables spread across a wide range of customers.
Due to the nature of the Groups operations, it is normal practice for customers to hold retentions in respect of contracts completed.
Retentions held by customers at 31 December 2007 were 66.2m 2006: 41.7m.
The Group manages its exposure to credit risk through the application of its credit risk management policies which specify the minimum requirements in respect of the credit worthiness of potential customers, assessed through reports from credit agencies, and the timing and extent of progress payments in respect of contracts.
The risk management policies of the Group also specify procedures in respect of obtaining parent company guarantees or, in certain circumstances, use of escrow accounts, which in the event of default means that the Group may have a secure claim.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of AROC or trade receivables.
