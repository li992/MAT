FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts 81 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The impact of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations on BG Groups Financial Statements for 2007 is set out below.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The Group has adopted the disclosure requirements in respect of financial instruments set out in IFRS 7 for the first time in these Financial Statements.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the significance of financial instruments for the Groups financial position and performance: and qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments.
This includes disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
This information can be found in note 21, page 104 and the Risk Factors section of the Business Review, pages 42 to 45.
Additional interpretations issued by IFRIC were mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2007 but did not result in any changes to the Groups accounting policies or disclosure.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC during 2007 but have not yet been endorsed by the EU or adopted by the Group: Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs The IASB issued amendments to IAS 23 in March 2007.
The main change from the previous version of IAS 23 is the removal of the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
BG Groups accounting policy is to capitalise costs associated with borrowings used to finance major capital projects and therefore the application of these amendments will not have a material impact on the Groups results.
The amendments to the standard are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 in September 2007.
The main changes from the previous version of IAS 1 are primarily in relation to the reporting of owner changes in equity and comprehensive income.
The amended standard requires that all changes in equity with owners must be presented separately from non-owner changes in equity, with income and expenses associated with non-owner changes in equity being presented either in a statement of comprehensive income or a separate income statement and a statement of comprehensive income.
The amended standard is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The application of the amendments is not expected to have a material impact on the way in which the Group presents its Financial Statements.
In addition, IFRIC issued IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes and IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Neither interpretation is expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
The Group will adopt the following standards and interpretations in 2008, subject to endorsement by the EU: IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 sets out the requirements for disclosure about an entitys operating segments and also about an entitys products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates and its major customers.
This standard is mandatory for financial statements beginning on or after 1 January 2009, although earlier application is permitted and BG Group intends to apply this standard in its Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 12 provides guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements.
It is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 although it has not yet been adopted by the EU.
BG Group is currently reviewing the interpretation to determine the likely impact on the Group.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 82 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION The primary reporting segments for BG Groups operations in 2007 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, Transmission and Distribution T&D, Power Generation Power and Other activities.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG combines the development and use of LNG import and export facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
T&D develops, owns and operates major pipelines and distribution networks, and supplies natural gas through these to the end customer.
Power develops, owns and operates natural gas-fired power generation plants around the world.
Other activities primarily comprise business development expenditure and corporate costs.
The Group manages its business segments on a global basis.
In 2007 most of the operations were managed in five main geographical areas: Europe and Central Asia, South America, Asia Pacific, North America and the Caribbean, and Mediterranean Basin and Africa.
From 1 January 2008, the Groups Asia Pacific and Mediterranean Basin and Africa regions were consolidated into the newly created Africa, Middle East and Asia region.
The Groups South America and North America and Caribbean regions were consolidated into the newly created Americas and Global LNG region.
The segmental analysis and results presentation on page 83 is aligned with the way the business was managed in 2007.
Intra-group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties arms length principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, net assets, gross assets and gross liabilities, depreciation and amortisation and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shown on page 83, analysed by business segment and geographical segment.
The presentation of BG Groups results under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement of certain financial instruments and profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and businesses.
Results excluding disposals, certain re-measurements and impairments Business Performance are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business Performance is given on page 140.
Disposals, re-measurements and impairments include unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term UK gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments used to manage certain price exposures in respect of optimising the timing and location of physical gas and LNG commitments, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of the income statement.
It is also relevant to present the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest and tax.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business Performance and operating profit including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.

Company Share Option Scheme Details of the Company Share Option Scheme CSOS are given on page 64.
Details of share options held by Executive Directors under the CSOS are given on page 69.
The first grants under the CSOS were made in November 2000.
Further grants have been made in all subsequent years up to and including 2007.
In 2007, grants of 12.9m 2006 14.8m share options were made under the CSOS.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the share options at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2007, the charge in respect of the CSOS was 18m 2006 15m.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the CSOS is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 7.87 2006 6.84, exercise price of 7.92 2006 6.90, dividend yield of 1.0% 2006 1.0%, volatility of 22% 2006 21%, a risk-free rate of 5.16% 2006 4.70% and an expected life of five years 2006 five years.
The average value of share options granted during the year was 2.09 per share 2006 1.70 per share.
Expected volatility for the 2006 and 2007 awards was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous five year period.
For awards in prior years, a three year period was used in the absence of data in respect of BG Groups share volatility over a five year period.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Long Term Incentive Scheme Details of the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS are given on page 64.
Details of notional allocations to Executive Directors under the LTIS are given on page 68.
In 2007, notional allocations of 4.0m ordinary shares 2006 3.6m ordinary shares were made under the LTIS.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the shares at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
In 2007, the charge in respect of the LTIS was 12m 2006 10m.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year in respect of the LTIS is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 7.87 2006 6.84, exercise price of nil 2006 nil, a risk-free rate of 4.9% 2006 5.2% and a vesting period of three years 2006 three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the LTIS comparator group as set out on page 64 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year was 4.38 per share 2006 4.13 per share.
The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of shares for the LTIS are based on US data because most of the companies in the LTIS comparator group are US-based.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.

Details of share options held by Executive Directors are given on page 69.
In 2007, grants of 0.7m 2006 0.7m share options were made under the Sharesave Scheme.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the share option at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2007, the charge in respect of the Sharesave Scheme was 1m 2006 1m.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the Sharesave Scheme is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 10.06 2006 6.84, exercise price of 7.16 2006 5.82, dividend yield of 1.0% 2006 1.0%, volatility of 25% 2006 22%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.47% 2006 4.74% and a weighted average expected life of 3 years 2006 4.1 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 3.76 per share 2006 2.11 per share.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three year period.
The expected life used in the model is based on the contractual terms in the Sharesave Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan Details of the BG Group Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 65.
During the year, 0.6m ordinary shares were awarded as Free Shares under the plan 2006 0.5m ordinary shares.
Under IFRS 2 the charge to the income statement in respect of the award is based on the market value of the shares at the grant date.
The fair value of the shares awarded during the year was 7.30 per share 2006 7.73 per share.
In 2007, the charge in respect of the SIP was 4m 2006 4m.
Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments Cash-settled share-based payments arise when the Group incurs a liability to transfer cash amounts that are based on the price or value of the Companys shares.
A charge of 4m has been made in respect of cash-settled CSOS awards 2006 3m the terms of which are the same as the equity-settled CSOS awards and a charge of 22m 2006 10m has been made in respect of social security costs on employee share option and share schemes.
The charge for cash-settled CSOS awards and social security costs on employee share option and share schemes covers awards made before and after 7 November 2002.
During the vesting period the costs of the cash-settled CSOS awards are charged to the income statement based on the fair value of the share option at the balance sheet date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value of the non-vested cashsettled options at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price of 11.50 2006 7.03, weighted average exercise price of 7.67 2006 4.72, dividend yield of 1.0% 2006 1.0%, volatility of 22.60% 2006 20.80%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.72% 2006 5.09% and a weighted average expected life of five years 2006 three years.
The average fair value of non-vested cash-settled CSOS awards at the balance sheet date was 5.04 2006 3.02.
For awards that had vested, but not been exercised at the balance sheet date, the fair value was the intrinsic value of the award at the balance sheet date.
The charge to the income statement in respect of social security costs has been calculated based on the fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date multiplied by the current employers National Insurance rate.
The fair value of the awards that had not vested at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo projection model where appropriate.
For CSOS awards the following assumptions were used: share price of 11.50 2006 7.03, weighted average exercise price of 6.68 2006 5.10, dividend yield of 1.0% 2006 1.0%, volatility of 22.60% 2006 20.80%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.70% 2006 5.08% and a weighted average expected life of four years 2006 four years.
The average fair value of non-vested CSOS awards at the balance sheet date was 5.64 2006 2.81.
For the LTIS awards the following assumptions were used: share price of 11.50 2006 7.03, volatility of 24.80% 2006 22.34%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.69% 2006 5.20%, and a weighted average expected life of two years 2006 two years.
The weighted average fair value of LTIS awards at the balance sheet date was 8.90 2006 3.40. www.

OPERATING COSTS 2006 In 2006, given the uncertainties surrounding the Brindisi LNG project, the Brindisi asset was subject to an impairment review.
The impairment review of the Brindisi regasification plant compared the value in use using a pre-tax discount rate of 8% with the carrying value of this asset, resulting in an impairment charge of 104m to operating costs post-tax 97m.
DISPOSAL OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS 2007 In December 2007, BG Group disposed of its exploration licences in Italy.
This resulted in a gain on disposal of 1m.
No tax arose on the disposal.
In June 2007, the Group sold its 25% equity interest in Interconnector UK Limited whilst retaining its throughput capacity contracts with this company.
This resulted in a preand post-tax gain on disposal of 157m.
As part of this transaction, the Group reviewed the retained capacity contracts in the Interconnector pipeline and concluded that the obligations associated with these contracts exceed the benefit expected to be received from the Interconnector interest.
Accordingly, a pre-tax provision of 156m post-tax 124m was made to reflect the present obligation under these contracts.
The overall transaction generated a pre-tax gain on disposal of 1m post-tax 33m.
In April 2007, the Group disposed of selected Canadian assets.
This resulted in a gain on disposal of 18m.
In January 2007, the Group disposed of its Mauritanian interests.
This resulted in a loss on disposal of 1m.
2006 In 2006, the Group made disposals of interests in certain non-core businesses, resulting in a net pre-tax loss of 7m.
No tax arose on these disposals.
In November 2006, the Group sold two LNG ships, which resulted in a 35m profit on disposal.
In December 2006, the Group committed to a plan to dispose of its interests in its Mauritania Holdings B. V. and Microgen businesses and accordingly reclassified these businesses as held for sale.
As a result, they were revalued to fair value less disposal costs.
Fair value was based on estimated disposal proceeds.
This resulted in a pre-tax charge to the income statement of 77m post-tax charge of 56m, including provision for impairment of 67m.
Mauritania Holdings B. V. was sold in January 2007.
As at 31 December 2007, the closure of Microgen was complete.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
No goodwill impairment has been recognised.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from the value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on approved financial plans covering a five year period.
The growth rate assumptions used in the plans were based on past performance and managements expectations of market development.
The annual growth rates in the business plan used to determine cash flows beyond the five year period are between 5% and 9% and do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The projected cash flows were discounted using a nominal rate of 8% to arrive at value in use.
The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects risks relating to the T&D segment.

The cash consideration of 352m included 1m of costs directly attributable to the combination.
The Groups results for the year include operating profit of 11m and profit after tax of 7m in respect of the Lake Road power plant.
Had the acquisition date for this combination been at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that the Groups consolidated revenue, operating profit and profit after tax would not have been materially different.
In addition, BG Group acquired the remaining equity 66.3% of Serene S. p. A. now BG Italia Power S. p. A. on 14 February 2007 and the Masspower power plant on 1 May 2007, both for cash consideration.

Included in the above are 87m of non-current assets attributable to the Masspower acquisition, the fair value of which is considered provisional as at 31 December 2007, pending finalisation of the fair value exercise.
It is anticipated that finalisation of the initial accounting will not result in material adjustments to the net assets acquired.
The cash consideration of 155m included 1m of costs directly attributable to the combinations.
The Groups results for the year include operating profit of 15m and profit after tax of 12m for the combined entities.
If the combined entities had been acquired at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that BG Groups consolidated revenue, operating profit and profit after tax would not have been materially different.

As part of its interest rate risk strategy the Group has entered into interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk.
The disclosure above is presented after the effect of these interest rate swaps.
Further information on the fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in note 21, page 104.
The effective post-swap interest rates as at 31 December 2007 were between 5% and 13% 2006 3% and 19%.
For amounts falling due within one year the effective post-swap interest rates were between 5% and 8% 2006 3% and 19%.
Fixed rate borrowings that are not in fair value hedge relationships mature between 2008 and 2028 2006 mature between 2008 and 2028 and the interest rates are not subject to re-pricing prior to maturity.

COMPOSITION OF THE GROUPS UNDRAWN COMMITTED FACILITIES The Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions have been met, as follows: 2007 2006 m m Expiring: Within one year 65 299 Between one and two years 46 18 Between two and three years 429 Between three and four years Between four and five years 522 633 746 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TREASURY INSTRUMENTS The Group is exposed to credit risk, interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and liquidity risk.
As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage the composition of floating and fixed rate debt.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts and currency swaps to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined foreign currency and interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy is not to use interest and exchange rate derivatives for speculative purposes.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Risk factors section of the Business Review under Fluctuations in exchange rates and Interest rate and liquidity risk on pages 42 and 45.
COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain long-term gas sales contracts in the UK have terms within the contract that constitute written options and accordingly they fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts also include pricing terms which are based on a variety of commodities and indices, including oil, electricity and the Retail Prices Index RPI.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
These have all been included within other commodity derivatives in the following tables.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Risk factors section of the Business Review under Commodity prices on page 42. www.
com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 105 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued VALUATION The Group calculates the fair value of interest rate and currency exchange rate derivative instruments by using market valuations where available or, where not available, by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of commodity contracts and commodity related derivatives is based on forward price curves, where available.
Where observable market valuations are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using quotes from third-parties or the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
One of the assumptions underlying the fair value of long-term UK gas contracts is that the gas market in the UK is liquid for two years.
As at 31 December 2007, the average two year forward price for UK gas was 51p per therm 2006 36p per therm.
Beyond this period a seasonally adjusted UK gas price of 45p per therm 2006 31p per therm has been used along with an electricity price of 45 per megawatt hour 2006 28 per megawatt hour.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then discounted using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Using these assumptions, the change in fair value of long-term UK gas contracts charged to the income statement in the year is 140m 2006 366m credit.
As at 31 December 2007, the potential change in the fair value of long-term commodity contracts, assuming a 10% change in the price assumptions, was 27m 2006 30m.

Derivative financial instruments are treated as expiring within one year and classified within current assets and current liabilities unless they form part of a designated hedge relationship, when they are classified according to the period in which the derivative is expected to expire.
Included within derivatives classified as expiring within one year are the long-term UK gas contracts which expire between 2009 and 2014 2006 between 2007 and 2014, other commodity derivatives which expire between 2008 and 2017 2006 between 2007 and 2012, and certain currency and cross-currency interest rate derivatives that are not part of a formal hedging relationship which expire between 2008 and 2036 2006 between 2007 and 2036.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent the gross combination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risk that the Group is exposed to from their use.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING In line with the Groups risk management policies, certain derivative and non-derivative instruments are designated as hedges of currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures in accordance with IAS 39.
Further information can be found in the Financial instruments and Commodity instruments sections of the Financial review on page 36.
Fair Value Hedges As at 31 December 2007, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The fixed rate loans and the related swaps have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2007 is 8m 2006 3m.
During 2007, adjustments of 3 m 2006 16m have been made to borrowings in respect of highly effective fair value hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts and currency exchange rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales.
The cash flow hedges were assessed as highly effective and an unrealised pre-tax loss of 54m 2006 73m gain was deferred in equity as at 31 December 2007.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within four years 2006 five years following the year end and the associated gains and losses deferred in equity will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction occurs.
As at 31 December 2007, deferred pre-tax losses of 15m 2006 1m gain are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2007 is 53 m 2006 75m.
Note 26, page 111 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from equity to the income statement in respect of transactions completed during the year.
These items are reported within the income statement to match against the underlying transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2007, certain currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of net investments in the Groups foreign operations, and are used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Fair value movements in the designated currency derivatives are transferred to equity to offset the gains and losses arising on the retranslation of the net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on highly effective designated currency derivatives deferred within equity as at 31 December 2007 is 9m 2006 15m.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2007 is 113m 2006 117m.
FINANCIAL ASSETS EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM DEBTORS The Groups financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents of 1 881m 2006 1 463m, loans made to joint ventures and associates of 658m 2006 591m, other long-term investments of 1m 2006 1m and debtors due after more than one year of 49m 2006 49m.
The currency and interest rate profile of financial assets is as follows: 2007 2006 Fixed rate Floating rate Non-interest Fixed rate Floating rate Non-interest financial assets financial assets bearing assets Total financial assets financial assets bearing assets Total m m m m m m m m Currency: Sterling 84 1 335 124 1 543 95 1 106 88 1 289 US Dollars 41 683 65 789 44 638 83 765 Other 248 9 257 33 17 50 125 2 266 198 2 589 139 1 777 188 2 104 The effective interest rates on the loans to joint ventures and associates as at 31 December 2007 were between 0% and 9.95% 2006 0% and 9.95%.
Within floating rate financial assets, cash and cash equivalents earn interest at the relevant market rates or, where invested in money market liquidity funds, as determined by the investment returns of the relevant fund.
In each case, investment performance is measured against the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR for the relevant currency and maturity.
Periodic interest rate determinations in respect of other floating rate financial assets generally comprise LIBOR plus or minus an agreed margin.
As at 31 December 2007, 84m 2006 95m of fixed rate loans to joint ventures and associates expire in 2016 2006 expire in 2016 and have effective interest rates of between 7.25% and 9.95% 2006 between 7.25% and 9.95%.
The maturity profile of the remaining loans to joint ventures and associates cannot be practicably estimated as repayments are based on the performance of the individual joint venture or associate.
As at 31 December 2007, 41m 2006 44m of fixed rate debtors due after more than one year expire between 2011 and 2015 2006 expire between 2011 and 2015 and have effective interest rates of 6% 2006 between 10.95% and 12.66%.

The fair values of the fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates as repayment of these loans are linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
A description of these principal risks and the actions taken by management to mitigate some of the exposure is outlined in the Risk factors section of the Business Review on page 42.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the section below.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures keep liquidity risk low.
The Group proposes to meet its financial commitments from both the operating cash flows of the business and from use of the money and capital markets, including existing committed lines of credit.
The undiscounted contractual cash flows receivable payable under financial instruments as at the balance sheet date are as follows: Between Between Within one and two two and five After five As at 31 December 2007 one year years years years Total m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 406 236 732 1 809 3 183 Short-term creditors 906 906 Other financial liabilities 20 20 1 312 236 732 1 829 4 109 Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate derivatives 1 1 2 Currency exchange and cross-currency interest rate derivatives 417 1 512 1 696 430 4 055 Gross settled commodity derivatives 1 106 273 175 1 554 Net settled commodity derivatives 64 39 24 127 1 588 1 824 1 896 430 5 738 Non-derivative and derivative financial assets 5 712 2 714 3 000 1 317 12 743 Total as at 31 December 2007 2 812 654 372 942 2 896 BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 108 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued Between Between Within one and two two and five After five As at 31 December 2006 one year years years years Total m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 209 339 423 1 807 2 778 Short-term creditors 766 766 Other financial liabilities 15 15 975 339 423 1 822 3 559 Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate derivatives 1 1 2 4 Currency exchange and cross-currency interest rate derivatives 182 204 1 232 671 2 289 Gross settled commodity derivatives 741 200 100 1 1 042 Net settled commodity derivatives 11 13 32 56 935 418 1 366 672 3 391 Non-derivative and derivative financial assets 4 061 895 2 424 1 440 8 820 Total as at 31 December 2006 2 151 138 635 1 054 1 870 Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale customers including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are normally accepted.
Limits are established for banks and financial institutions and Group management monitors exposures periodically.
If wholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, business credit policies dictate the credit quality assessment which takes account of financial position and other factors.
Limits are established for wholesale trading businesses and business and Group management monitors overall exposures periodically.
As at 31 December 2007, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was 7m 2006 5m, currency derivatives 127m 2006 122m and commodity related derivatives 307m 2006 387m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under short-term debtors and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollar to pound Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices and Japan Crude Cocktail JCC prices.
The table below illustrates the indicative post-tax effects on the income statement and equity of applying reasonably foreseeable market movements to the Groups financial instruments at the balance sheet date.

The deferred tax liability of 1 258m 2006 1 146m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: the liability prior to such offset is 1 724m 2006 1 424m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 1 258m 2006 1 134m.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1 960m 2006 1 395m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Company had a deferred tax asset of 7m at 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 nil.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.
The Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of 78m 2006 219m and unrecognised tax losses of 389m 2006 210m to carry forward against future taxable income.
To the extent unutilised, 98m of these losses will expire between 2008 and 2012.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 252m 2006 252m : these tax losses can only be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
The Group also has unrecognised overseas tax credits of 181m 2006 159m.

F LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Court of Brindisi is pursuing a criminal investigation against certain former employees and consultants of BG Group and BG Italia S. p. A. BG Italia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, into allegations of improper conduct associated with the authorisation process for the planned Brindisi LNG regasification terminal.
The Italian authorities have also alleged that certain current and former directors of Brindisi LNG S. p. A. Brindisi LNG, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Italia, unlawfully permitted the occupation and alteration of public land, namely the port area in Brindisi where the regasification terminal is due to be constructed, as a result of improperly authorised permits.
Also, BG Italia has been notified by the Court of Brindisi that it is under investigation in relation to the allegations referred to above for possible violations of Legislative Decree No.
231 2001, an Italian anti-corruption statute which imposes liability on corporate entities under certain circumstances in the event criminal acts are committed by management or employees of the company.
A court hearing in relation to the criminal investigation has been scheduled for 13 March 2008 to consider whether criminal charges in relation to the above allegations should be brought against BG Italia and or any of the individuals involved.
In addition, the Italian authorities are still carrying out further investigations, the scope of which is unknown.
In October 2007, BG Group received formal notification from the Ministry of Economic Development that the original Article 8 authorisation for the construction and operation of Brindisi LNG had been suspended pending the submission by BG Group of a full Environmental Impact Assessment EIA and confirmation from the Italian authorities as to the validity of the Article 8 authorisation.
On 15 January 2008, BG Group commenced the EIA approval process by submitting an EIA.
Notwithstanding that BG Group has commenced the EIA approval process, BG Group has challenged the suspension of the Article 8 authorisation in the administrative courts.
The Municipality of Brindisi has also challenged the suspension, arguing that the authorisation should have been annulled rather than suspended.
This action, if successful, could result in the authorisation being annulled, subject to any rights of appeal.
There are various other ongoing legal proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, for example relating to consents necessary for the construction work and environmental procedures.
The impact of these legal proceedings cannot yet be quantified but could delay or deny BG Group access to the Brindisi LNG terminal site.
In addition, various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as shown in these Financial Statements.

com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 115 29 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme is of the defined benefit type.
It is a registered formerly approved pension scheme established under trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Most members contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 3% of pensionable salary.
Participating employers contributions, including Scheme expenses, are certified by the Schemes independent qualified actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the employers contribution rate in respect of most Scheme members was effectively 26.9% of pensionable pay.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2005.
The actuarial valuation showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets at 31 March 2005 was 318m, representing some 91% of the accrued liabilities.
The Group has made payments of 22m and intends to make a further payment of 11m in 2008 in order to reduce the Schemes deficit.
The next such valuation will be undertaken as at 31 March 2008.
As a result of the new pensions tax regime introduced in April 2006, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme is now available to provide benefits in excess of the new lifetime allowance.
This scheme is an unfunded, unregistered formerly unapproved arrangement.
With effect from 2 April 2007 new UK employees have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BG Group Retirement Benefits Plan the Plan.
Life assurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
Members may choose the rate at which they contribute to the Plan and the employers contribution is determined by the rate that the member selects.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose how the contributions will be invested.
There is an unfunded post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Comgas.
Provision has been made in respect of this plan.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes and smaller defined benefit schemes.
These are not material in Group terms.
The following information in respect of the Scheme, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme and the Comgas post-retirement healthcare plan described hereafter as the plans has been provided in accordance with IAS 19.
Valuations of all of the plans assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2007 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor was applied.
This means that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date before deducting plan assets : and b 10% of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2007 2006 Comgas Comgas healthcare healthcare BG plans plan BG plans plan % % % % a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.5 5.0 3.1 5.0 Future increases in earnings 5.5 n a 5.1 n a Discount rate 5.6 11.3 4.9 11.3 b Healthcare cost trend rate n a 9.2 n a 9.2 a Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
b The rate for the Comgas healthcare plan is initially at 9.2% trending to 6.8% over 45 years 2006 9.2% trending to 6.8%.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BG plans was increased by 0.1% to 5.7%, the defined benefit obligation would decrease by 16m and the service cost for 2008 would decrease by 1m.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the accounts continued 116 29 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2007 for the BG plans, mortality assumptions are based on the 1992 mortality series issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to the members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMI Bureaus medium cohort tables, subject to a minimum rate of improvement on the projected mortality rates of 1% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in ten years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years 31 Dec 2007 31 Dec 2017 Male age 60 27.2 28.2 Male age 65 22.3 23.2 Female age 60 30.4 31.4 Female age 65 25.4 26.4 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BG Plans would increase by 15m and the service cost for 2008 would increase by 1m.
As at 31 December 2007, the value of the plans assets and expected rates of return, together with the liabilities in the plans, were as follows: 2007 2006 Expected Percentage Expected Percentage rate of of plans rate of of plans return a assets Value return a assets Value % % m % % m Equities 7.9 63 372 7.7 64 306 Absolute return strategies 7.4 22 128 7.2 20 97 Index-linked gilts 4.6 5 28 4.3 5 23 Corporate bonds 5.9 10 60 5.5 10 49 Cash 4.5 3 4.1 1 7 Total market value of assets 591 482 Present value of liabilities 792 727 Deficit in plans 201 245 Unrecognised net loss 36 78 Net benefit liability 165 167 a Long-term expected rate of return.
The expected rate of return on assets has been determined following advice from the funded plans independent actuary and is based on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long-term asset strategy.
A real return relative to price inflation of 4.4% a premium of 3.3% over the yield on index-linked gilts is expected on equities.
The expected return on absolute return strategies is 0.5% below the equities return.
The overall expected rate of return as at 31 December 2007 was 7.4%.
