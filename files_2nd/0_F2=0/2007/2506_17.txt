British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 48 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 1.
Presentation of the Financial Statements i Description of Business British Energy group plc is engaged in the generation and sale of electricity.
references to British Energy or the company are to British Energy group plc, the ultimate holding company of the group.
references to the group are to the company and its subsidiaries.
the group operates eight nuclear power stations and one coal-fired power station in the united Kingdom.
British Energy group plc is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in great Britain.
the companys ordinary shares are traded on the london stock Exchange.
the consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 30 may 2007. ii Compliance with Applicable Law and IFRS the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the European union Eu, international financial reporting interpretations committee ifric interpretations and the provisions of the companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs.
iii Financial Period the consolidated financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2006 to 31 march 2007, with comparative figures for the financial year from 1 April 2005 to 31 march 2006. iv Composition of the Group A list of subsidiary undertakings which, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affected the amount of profit or the net assets of the group is given in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
v Composition of the Consolidated Financial Statements the consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings, and comprise the following: consolidated income statement: consolidated statement of recognised income and expense: consolidated balance sheet: consolidated statement of cash flows: and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
vi Accounting Convention the consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, modified for certain items carried at fair value, as stated in the accounting policies.
vii Parent Company Financial Statements British Energy group plc, the company, has not adopted ifrs and has therefore drawn up separate financial statements in accordance with united Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles uK gAAp.
these are presented in the Annual report on pages 87 to 91.
Accounting Policies i Significant Estimates and Judgements Used in Applying Accounting Policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
the principal accounting policies adopted by the group in the consolidated financial statements are as set out below.
the application of a number of these policies required the group to use a variety of estimation techniques and apply judgement to best reflect the substance of underlying transactions.
significant factors considered when using estimates to assess the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates.
the group has determined that a number of its accounting policies can be considered significant, in terms of the management judgement that has been required to determine the various assumptions underpinning their application in the consolidated financial statements presented which, under different conditions, could lead to material differences in these statements.
the policies where significant judgements have been made are the: application of business combination accounting rules: accounting for property, plant and equipment: accounting for coal inventory: estimation of liabilities for spent nuclear fuel and decommissioning costs: estimation of retirement benefit obligations: estimation of fair value of derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts: and accounting for deferred tax.
Actual results can differ from estimates.

Accounting Policies continued ii Revenue revenue is recognised by the group when a sales arrangement exists, delivery of goods or services has occurred, the amount of revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group.
revenue represents the fair value of the consideration receivable for sales of electricity supplied during the period and sales of other related goods and services.
it is shown net of value added tax, electricity purchases relating to short-term balancing and hedging activities, and climate change levy.
revenue is also shown after elimination of sales within the group.
Wholesale generation and direct supply sales are recognised on an accruals basis with reference to meter readings of electricity supplied.
Where required, a management estimate is included of the value of units supplied to customers between the date of their last meter reading and the accounting period end.
Where an estimate of electricity supplied is required, the estimate is calculated using historical consumption patterns and is included in trade receivables.
revenue includes miscellaneous income that comprises mainly services to magnox in respect of shared sites.
iii Fuel Costs Nuclear Front End Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors AGR front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services and fuel element fabrication.
fabrication costs comprise fixed and variable elements.
All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
Pressurised Water Reactor PWR All front end fuel costs are variable and are capitalised into inventory and subsequently charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
iv Fuel Costs Nuclear Back End AGR spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste products.
Back end fuel costs comprise: a a cost per tonne of uranium in Agr fuel, in respect of amounts payable on loading of fuel into any one of the Agr reactors: and b a rebate surcharge against the cost mentioned in a above that is dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the year and the amount of electricity generated in the year.
the loading related cost and the rebate surcharge is capitalised into inventory and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
PWR Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs comprise the estimated cost of this process at current prices discounted back to current value.
Back end fuel costs are capitalised into inventory on loading and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
v Unburnt Fuel at Shutdown Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be some unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure.
the costs of this unburnt fuel final core are fully provided at the balance sheet date and any changes in the carrying value of nuclear fuel attributed to the final core are charged to the consolidated income statement in the accounting period.
vi Fuel Costs Coal fuel costs for coal are determined on a weighted average cost basis.
fuel costs for coal also include costs of carbon allowances see note 2 xiv.
vii Research Expenditure Expenditure on scientific and engineering research, preliminary studies and the initiation of new technologies is categorised as research and charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
viii Operating Leases leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
ix Foreign Currencies transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 50 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 2.
Accounting Policies continued x Share-based Payment the group has five share compensation schemes, the share incentive plan, the long term Deferred Bonus plan, the Deferred incentive plan, the Executive share option plan 2004 and the interim Bonus plan.
the group accounts for its share compensation schemes in accordance with ifrs 2 share-based payment ifrs 2. the fair value of the share compensation schemes is charged to the consolidated income statement over the period from the date the awards were granted to the date at which the compensation is expected to vest on the employees.
the corresponding credit is included in total shareholders equity.
the group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the groups various employee share compensation schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
the fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
xi Exceptional Items Exceptional items, by their nature, are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the group.
Exceptional items are material to the results for the year and are of a non-recurring nature and are therefore presented separately.
xii Taxation current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
temporary differences are differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged to the consolidated income statement except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.
xiii Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation property, plant and equipment comprises assets acquired or constructed by the group.
property, plant and equipment other than assets in the course of construction are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation.
the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired as a result of the restructuring was deemed to be the cost amount recognised at that date.
cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Accumulated depreciation includes additional charges made where necessary to reflect impairment in value.
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost and not depreciated until commissioned.
the charge for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is based on the straight line method so as to write off the costs of assets, after taking into account provisions for diminution in value, over their estimated useful lives.
the asset lives adopted are reviewed annually and for the year ended 31 march 2007 were: Agr power stations 416 years pWr power station 28 years coal power station 9 years other buildings 30 years other plant and equipment 18 months 5 years Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, or to improve its operational performance is included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Expenditure to improve safety or in order to meet increased regulatory standards is also capitalised.
Expenditure on major inspection and overhauls of production plant is capitalised, within other plant and equipment, when it meets the asset recognition criteria and is depreciated over the period until the next outage.
for Agr power stations, this depreciation period is three years, for the pWr power station it is 18 months and for Eggborough it is four years.
major spare parts are classified as property, plant and equipment and assigned to individual stations when they are expected to be utilised over more than one period.
they are depreciated using the applicable station lifetime estimate.
gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are included in operating profit.

Accounting Policies continued xiv Intangible Assets excluding Goodwill the costs of acquired computer software are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software in to use, and are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated operational lives for a maximum of five years.
costs directly associated with the development of computer software programmes that are expected to generate economic benefits over a period in excess of one year are also capitalised and amortised over their estimated operational lives.
purchased renewable obligation certificates rocs and levy Exemption certificates lEcs are initially recognised at cost within intangible assets.
A liability for rocs is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the uK government and the renewable obligation certificate buyout price for that period.
rocs and lEcs have sustainable values and can be used over an unrestricted period and therefore they are not amortised.
under the Eu Emissions trading scheme Eu Ets, granted carbon allowances received in a period are initially recognised at nil value within intangible assets.
purchased carbon allowances are initially recognised at cost within intangible assets.
Allowances granted are apportioned over the year in line with actual and forecast emissions for the relevant emissions year.
A liability is recognised when actual emissions are greater than the granted allowances apportioned for the year.
the liability is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating profit.
forward contracts for the purchase or sale of carbon allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement in the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line.
on delivery of forward contracts, carbon allowances are capitalised in intangible assets at cost, with any permanent reduction to bring the carrying value in line with market prices being presented within fuel costs.
carbon allowances have a sustainable value and can be used in settlement of our Eu Ets obligation at any time within the corresponding Eu Ets phase.
As a result, carbon allowances are not amortised.
xv Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets excluding Goodwill At each balance sheet date, the group reviews its tangible assets and intangible assets excluding goodwill see note 2 xvi to determine whether there is any indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment loss.
if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is assessed.
if an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce the assets carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
xvi Goodwill goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration at acquisition compared to the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset on the consolidated balance sheet.
following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
goodwill balances are assessed for impairment at least annually and at other balance sheet dates if there is any indication of impairment.
xvii NLF Funding Arrangements under the arrangements with the secretary of state the nlf will fund, subject to certain exceptions, the groups qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs.
to the extent there is any surplus remaining in the nlf after all obligations have been discharged, this amount will be paid to the secretary of state.
the group is responsible for funding certain excluded or disqualified liabilities and will, in certain circumstances, be required to compensate or indemnify the nlf and the secretary of state in relation to such liabilities.
the groups obligations under these arrangements with the secretary of state are guaranteed by certain companies within the group.
in consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the secretary of state and the nlf, British Energy holdings plc a subsidiary of the company issued 275m in Bonds to the nlf at rED.
the group will also make the following payments to the nlf: i an annual contribution cash sweep payment initially equal to 65% of the British Energy groups adjusted net cash flow, adjusted for certain corporate actions but never to exceed 65% cash sweep percentage : ii fixed decommissioning contributions equal to 20m per annum indexed to rpi but tapering off as the nuclear power stations are currently scheduled to close : and iii 150,000 indexed to rpi for every tonne of uranium in pWr fuel loaded into the sizewell B reactor after rED.
the nlf has the right from time to time to convert all or part of the cash sweep payment into convertible shares of the company the nlf conversion right.
on a full conversion, the nlf would hold up to 65% of the thereby enlarged equity share capital of the company.
however, the terms of the convertible shares include a limit on the voting rights of such shares equal to a maximum of 29.9% whilst held by the nlf.
see note 27 for more details on the convertible shares.
the annual cash sweep payment can only be determined after the end of the financial year and is contingent based on cash generation in the year.
therefore, it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable and not in any interim financial periods.
it will be recorded as an operating cost of the applicable financial year.
the annual cash sweep payment becomes payable 25 business days after publication of the Annual report and Accounts.
British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 52 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 2.
Accounting Policies continued the fixed decommissioning obligations of 20m per annum have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet at their discounted value and disclosed as the nlf liability.
the nlf liability is reduced as payments are made to the nlf.
Each year the financing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of nlf liabilities required to discharge one years discount from the liability.
pWr fuel loaded after rED will increase the qualifying nuclear liability recognised for back end pWr fuel costs as set out above and will increase the nlf receivable by a corresponding amount.
the difference between the payment of 150,000 indexed to rpi per tonne made to the nlf on the loading of pWr fuel and the increase in the liability recognised upon loading of this fuel will require to be matched against back end fuel costs as the loaded tonnes are burned in the pWr reactor.
xviii NLF and Nuclear Liabilities Receivables the government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on nlf funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities including pWr back end fuel services and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs.
the nlf receivable asset recognised represents the aggregate value of the nuclear liabilities fund and the government indemnity such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
the government indemnity is also provided to cover the cost of services for spent Agr fuel loaded pre-restructuring.
the nuclear liabilities receivable is recognised in respect of the indemnity such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
the nlf receivable and the nuclear liabilities receivable are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments.
Each year the financing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of these receivables required to match the revalorisation of the nuclear liabilities.
xix Nuclear Liabilities nuclear liabilities represent provision for the groups liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning.
the provisions represent the Directors best estimates of the costs expected to be incurred.
they are calculated based on the latest technical evaluation of the processes and methods likely to be used, and reflect current engineering knowledge.
the provisions are based on such commercial agreements as are currently in place, and reflect the Directors understanding of the current government policy and regulatory framework.
given that government policy and the regulatory framework on which our assumptions have been based may be expected to develop and that the Directors plans will be influenced by improvements in technology and experience gained from decommissioning activities, liabilities and the resulting provisions are likely to be adjusted.
in recognising the costs of generating electricity, accruals are made in respect of the following: a Back End Fuel Costs the treatment of back end fuel costs in the consolidated income statement has been dealt with under the accounting policies for fuel costs above.
these nuclear liabilities cover the reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel and the long-term storage, treatment and eventual disposal of nuclear waste.
they are based, as appropriate, on contractual arrangements or the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used to deal with these obligations under the current regulatory regime.
Accruals are included within nuclear liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, which are based on contractual arrangements and long-term cost forecasts, and which are reviewed regularly and adjusted where necessary.
b Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Stations the consolidated financial statements include provision for the full cost of decommissioning the groups nuclear power stations.
provision is made on the basis of the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used for decommissioning under the current regulatory regime.
the liabilities for back end fuel costs and decommissioning are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments.
Each year the financing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of liabilities required to discharge one years discount from provisions made in prior years and restate these provisions to current price levels.
xx Financial Instruments Recognition, Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities iAs 39 financial instruments: recognition and measurement iAs 39 requires that all financial assets and liabilities be initially recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value reported through the consolidated income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that effective cash flow hedges exist.
Exceptions apply to assets classified as loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and also to equity investments in instruments whose fair value can not be reliably measured, which are recognised and measured at cost.
financial liabilities are measured at fair value or at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
the group measures all debt instruments initially at fair value, and this is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received.
f i n A n c i A l s tAt E m E n t s British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 53 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 2.
Accounting Policies continued Where financial assets or financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, transaction costs any such costs incremental to and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instruments are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the consolidated income statement over the life of the instrument.
Where financial assets or financial liabilities are measured at fair value, transaction costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flow from the asset expires.
financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is extinguished or expires.
Accounting for Derivatives and Commodity Contracts the groups activities expose it primarily to risks associated with electricity generation, the purchase of fuel for use in the generation process, the purchase of carbon allowances and the supply of electricity to end customers in both the wholesale and retail markets.
the group follows a trading strategy of selling forward a proportion of the groups output to reduce the groups exposure to potential falls in the market price of electricity.
the use of derivative financial instruments occurs primarily within the groups electricity trading and coal and carbon allowance procurement activities.
the Board has endorsed the use of derivative financial instruments as hedging tools and the group uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures.
physical and financially settled instruments are held by the group to match offsetting physical positions and are not held for proprietary trading purposes.
Where commodity contracts, such as electricity and fuel, are entered into in accordance with the groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements own use they are excluded from the scope of iAs 39 and are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these contracts are recorded within trade payables and trade receivables respectively.
Where a commodity contract is not entered in to or does not continue to be held to meet the groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements it is treated as a derivative financial instrument, and the recognition and measurement requirements of iAs 39 are applied.
Derivative financial instruments are presented in the derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line of the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments that are held for trading, as defined by iAs 39, are initially recognised at fair value and all changes in fair value are subsequently accounted for through the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line of the consolidated income statement.
held for trading assets and liabilities are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash flows are initially recognised at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve.
the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
hedging instruments are classified as current or non-current with reference to the period of delivery.
the group designates derivatives as cash flow hedging instruments when it is expected that there will be a high inverse correlation between the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and the changes in the fair value of the cash flows of the hedged item.
this is measured primarily using the dollar offset method.
such correlation is required to be within the limits of 80% to 125% for hedge accounting to be permitted.
prospective and retrospective testing is carried out on a regular basis, at least on each reporting date, to establish whether the assumptions and application criteria for hedge accounting are supported.
the group discontinues hedge accounting where the hedging relationship correlation is outside the required parameters.
Derivative instruments are fide-designated from a hedge relationship when: the hedging instrument or item expires or is settled: the forecast transaction is no longer considered to be highly probable: and the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting under iAs 39 rules.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve, until the forecast transaction is settled.
if a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised within equity is transferred to the consolidated income statement of the period.
Valuation of Commodity Contracts and Derivatives the groups valuation policy for derivative and other financial instruments is to maximise the use of quoted prices from active trading markets.
All contracts that fall within the scope of iAs 39 are valued using observable market prices.
certain long-term structured transactions have been classified as own use and therefore fall outside the scope of iAs 39. the group considers that the uK electricity market is active for up to two years ahead, with reliable broker quotes and published prices available for this period.
British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 54 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 2.
Accounting Policies continued purchase contracts are valued against the quoted bid price and sales contracts are valued against the quoted offer prices, with no provisions made for liquidity.
Valuation adjustments are made for the time value of money, which is applied to all contracts, and credit risk, which will be applied where applicable.
principal values are undiscounted and are derived from the aggregate volumes and relevant contract prices of those sale and purchase contracts that are within the scope of iAs 39. the principal values provide an indication of the scope of the use of derivatives but do not reflect the risk the group is exposed to from entering into derivatives.
Embedded Derivatives the group also evaluates contracts for embedded derivatives, and considers whether any embedded derivatives have to be separated from the underlying host contract and accounted for separately in accordance with iAs 39 requirements.
Where embedded derivatives have terms that are not closely related to the terms of the host contract in which they are included, they are accounted for separately from the host contract as derivatives, with changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated income statement on the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line, to the extent that the hybrid instrument is not already accounted for at fair value.
if the fair value cannot be determined reliably based on the terms and conditions of the embedded derivatives, the fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated as the difference between the value of the hybrid instrument and the host contract excluding the derivative element.
Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities the group offsets a financial asset and a financial liability and reports the net amount only when the group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impact on Effective Tax Rate income tax for interim reporting periods is calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to the interim result excluding iAs 39 adjustments, and by calculating tax at the standard rate for the iAs 39 adjustments arising within the period.
xxi Inventory Stores inventory held in stores is recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
stores inventory is accounted for using the weighted average cost method.
xxii Restricted Cash and Other Financial Assets and Cash and Cash Equivalents restricted cash primarily consists of cash pledged as collateral.
other financial assets principally comprise net cash provided to satisfy variation margin calls in relation to trading through exchanges.
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand with banks and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
xxiii Provisions A provision is recognised when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
if the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
xxiv Employee Benefits Post Retirement Benefit Obligations the group provides for pension costs in accordance with iAs 19 2004 Employee Benefits iAs 19. contributions to the groups defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by qualified actuaries.
the group operates two separate pension arrangements in the uK within the Electricity supply pension scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme.
pension scheme assets are measured using market values, which for securities is based on bid price values.
pension costs are assessed using the projected unit method so that the cost of providing pensions is charged to the consolidated income statement in a manner which spreads the service cost over the expected service lives of employees.
the retirement benefit obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, discounted using the yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity.
the expected return on the plan assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the defined benefit obligations arising from the passage of time are included in other finance expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately within the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
the capital cost of ex-gratia and supplementary pensions is charged to the consolidated income statement, to the extent that the arrangements cannot be covered by any surplus in schemes, in the accounting period in which they are granted.
certain additional unfunded retirement benefits are provided to eligible employees.
the cost and actuarial gains and losses of providing such benefits is charged to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of recognised income and expense respectively.

Accounting Policies continued xxv New Accounting Standards the following accounting interpretation has been adopted by the group this year: ifric 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement contains a lease ifric 4 ifric 4 requires that arrangements which have the nature of a lease, but not the legal form, be accounted for in accordance with iAs 17 leases.
the application of this interpretation has had no material impact on the groups financial statements.
the following accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to accounting standards, which are relevant to the group but have not been applied in the year ended 31 march 2007, have been issued but are not yet effective: ifrs 7 financial instruments: Disclosures ifrs 7 ifrs 8 operating segments ifrs 8 ifric 9 reassessment of Embedded Derivatives ifric 9 ifric 10 interim financial reporting and impairment ifric 10 iAs 1 Amendments to iAs 1 presentation of financial statements iAs 1 ifrs 7 was issued in August 2005 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. this standard incorporates the disclosure requirements of iAs 32 financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, which it supersedes, and adds further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in relation to financial instruments.
With the exception of the additional disclosures required under ifrs 7, adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial statements.
ifrs 8 was issued in november 2006 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. this standard contains new regulations on the presentation of segmental information, and bases the definition and disclosures of segments on the information which is used internally by management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
notwithstanding the additional information to be disclosed, ifrs 8 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the groups financial statements.
ifric 9 was issued in march 2006 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006. the interpretation requires an assessment of whether or not an embedded derivative is accounted for separately from the host contract to be made when the contract is first entered into, and subsequent reassessment is prohibited, unless there is a change that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise have occurred under the contract.
ifric 9 is not expected to have a material impact on the group.
ifric 10 was issued in July 2006 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 november 2006. the interpretation requires that any impairment loss recognised on goodwill or equity investments in interim reporting periods may not be reversed in subsequent accounting periods.
ifric 10 is not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial statements.
iAs 1 was amended in August 2005 to coincide with the release of ifrs 7 and requires the disclosure of information regarding capital management.
the amendment to iAs 1 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. other than the additional disclosures required, the amendment to iAs 1 is not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial statements.
Segmental Information the groups activities are in one business segment being the generation and sale of electricity and are in one geographic segment being the united Kingdom.
there are no other significant classes of business or geographic areas.

Cash Sweep Payment under the terms of the restructuring the company has an obligation to make payments to the nlf should certain criteria be met.
the basis of the cash sweep payment and estimated cost, which remains subject to review by the nlf, is as follows: Year ended year ended 31 March 31 march 2007 2006 m m increase in cash as per the consolidated statement of cash flows 463 403 Decrease in restricted cash 111 15 increase in restricted cash excluded from cash sweep payment 1 Decrease in restricted cash for Agreed collateral purposes 112 15 other reconciling items 3 increase in available cash 351 391 payments to nlf 105 transfer to forecast Expenditure reserve 22 177 Amounts received from issue or sale of ordinary shares 6 9 cash required to be released retained to meet target Amount 1 43 Adjusted net cash flow 473 162 Weighted average payment percentage 64.38% 64.74% Cash Sweep Payment 305 105 An accrual for the cash sweep payment of 305m 2006: 105m is included in trade and other payables within current liabilities see note 21. on 11 september 2006 the cash sweep payment for the year ended 31 march 2006 was paid.

Cash Sweep Payment continued Target Amount and Cash Required to be Retained to Meet Target Amount the target Amount is 490m plus the incremental collateral Amount, which is the amount by which cash applied to providing collateral for the generation, sale and purchase by the group of electricity i. e. for Agreed collateral purposes exceeds 200m.
Any increase or decrease in the incremental collateral Amount shall automatically increase or decrease the target Amount by the same amount.
the restricted cash for Agreed collateral purposes at 31 march 2007 is 90m 2006: 201m, therefore the target Amount and cash required to be retained to meet target Amount at the balance sheet dates are as follows: Year ended year ended 31 March 31 march 2007 2006 m m cash required to be retained to meet target Amount in prior periods 491 448 Base target Amount 490 490 incremental collateral in excess of 200m see above 1 Target Amount at 31 March 490 491 Cash required to be released retained to meet Target Amount 1 43 Payments to NLF payments to nlf represent the aggregate of any payments made by or on behalf of the group to the nlf during the year, excluding fixed decommissioning payments of 20m per annum indexed to rpi but tapering off as the nuclear power stations are currently scheduled to close and 150,000 indexed to rpi for every tonne of uranium in pWr fuel loaded into sizewell B reactor after rED.
Forecast Expenditure Reserve the group has reduced the forecast Expenditure reserve by 22m to 155m 2006: 177m.
the forecast Expenditure reserve will be used to meet capital expenditure commitments and non-recurring maintenance and repair of a capital nature which is payable in the following financial year, as well as to fund capital expenditure, as defined in the underlying agreements.
Weighted Average Payment Percentage the weighted average payment percentage has decreased from 64.74% at 31 march 2006 to 64.38% at 31 march 2007, as a result of Warrants being exercised throughout the year and payment of the cash sweep in respect of the year ended 31 march 2006. the calculation is weighted to take account of the dates that the exercises of Warrants took place during the year and the cash sweep payment date.
Payment Percentage the nlf cash sweep percentage is 64.04% at 31 march 2007 2006: 64.63%.

Diluted Earnings Per Share the diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average of 570,769,647 2006: 566,822,853 ordinary shares in issue together with the dilutive weighted average of potential ordinary shares of 11,378,881 2006: 15,886,021 in respect of Warrants.
Adjusted Earnings Per Share the Directors consider that the adjusted earnings per share calculation is a more appropriate earnings measure because the cash sweep payment of 305m 2006: 105m and the net profit for the year attributable to shareholders of 465m 2006: 430m does not necessarily reflect the respective economic interests of the nlf and equity shareholders in the profits of the group.
the calculation in any given year of the annual cash sweep payment is based on cash flows and the retention of appropriate cash target Amount and expenditure forecast Expenditure reserve reserves see note 8. the adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the cash sweep payment expense from earnings and adjusting the weighted average share capital by the number of shares that would have been in issue if the nlf had fully converted their interest at the balance sheet date.

under the requirements of ifrs 3, during the year ended 31 march 2006 23m was charged to the consolidated income statement to reduce goodwill in relation to recognition of a deferred tax asset at 31 march 2006, which at rED did not satisfy the recognition criteria within ifrs 3 due to uncertainty of recoverability.
Additionally during that year 23m was credited within the tax charge in the consolidated income statement to reflect the recognition of the deferred tax asset see note 10. for impairment testing purposes goodwill has been fully allocated to one cash generating unit being the total of the groups operating and generating assets.
there were no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to the cash generating unit.
the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit at 31 march 2007 was determined using estimated fair value less costs to sell.
the calculation of fair value less costs to sell was based on a discounted cash flow valuation over the lives of the power stations, using available market information to reflect the amount that the group estimates that it could have obtained, at the balance sheet date, from the disposal of the asset in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal.
the calculation of fair value less costs to sell for the cash generating unit is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: electricity prices: projected output: fuel costs: other operating costs and investment: and cash sweep payment obligation.
the groups approach in determining the key assumptions was as follows: Electricity prices were based on contracted and projected commodity prices for electricity.
projected market prices for electricity were based on an external market view of projected long-term electricity prices.
projected output was based on expected levels of output over the expected operating lives of the power stations using the groups own engineering projections which considered historical performance, plant degradation, plant maintenance activity and investment, and allow for scheduled timings of outages and refuelling.
Where possible these assumptions were validated externally.
f i n A n c i A l s tAt E m E n t s British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 65 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 15.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets continued fuel costs were based on contracted and projected commodity prices, for coal and nuclear fuel, and using the groups own engineering projections for consumption having considered historical consumption data and projected plant performance.
other operating costs and investment was estimated using the groups own engineering projections, where relevant, and having considered historical performance, plant degradation, plant maintenance activity and investment.
the estimates of other operating costs and investment used in the discounted cash flow projection were consistent with those used in the groups three year business plan.
in subsequent periods the growth rate applied to other operating costs was based on the rpi and fully reflects the expected operating lives of the power stations.
the impairment calculations made allowance for projected levels of cash sweep payment.
the projection used the cash sweep percentage as at 31 march 2007 as a starting point, with adjustments in subsequent years to allow for retentions of undistributed cash following payment of dividends in line with the groups dividend policy as set out in the financial review.
A pre-tax discount rate of 23% was used equivalent to a post-tax discount rate of 9%.
With regard to the assessment of value of the cash generating unit, British Energy is of the opinion that, based on current knowledge, reasonably possible changes in any of the above key assumptions would not cause the carrying value to exceed the recoverable amount.
Software software is amortised over its estimated operational life for a maximum of five years.
the amortisation of software is recognised in the amortisation and other charges line of the consolidated income statement.
ROCs and LECs rocs and lEcs have a sustainable value and can be used in settlement of an obligation over an undefined period and therefore, on this basis, rocs and lEcs are not amortised.
included within additions of 40m in the year 2006: 30m are rocs and lEcs with a value of 8m 2006: 4m which were produced internally.
Carbon allowances carbon allowances are not amortised because they are held to settle the groups Eu Ets obligation and therefore have a sustainable value.
During the year the group took delivery of carbon allowances, which had been purchased under forward contracts.
in line with the groups accounting policy, the carbon allowances were recognised within intangible assets at cost.
subsequently, a write down of 41m 2006: nil was charged to the consolidated income statement to reflect a reduction in market prices of carbon allowances.
if the write down of carbon allowances had not occurred, carbon allowances would be carried at 44m.

Financial Instruments and Derivatives Overview the groups principal financial instruments include derivative commodity contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, purchase of coal and carbon allowances, interest bearing debt, loans, investments in short-dated commerical paper, cash held in collateral accounts, cash and short-term deposits.
the main financial risks faced by the group are trading risks in respect of the sale of electricity.
Electricity trading risks include exposure to electricity price fluctuations, balancing of output volume with contractual commitments, commodity coal, carbon allowances and uranics and counterparty credit risk.
these are managed by the power and Energy trading Division which operates within policies and procedures that are approved and monitored by the Board.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Contracts All contracts for the sale of electricity through British Energy Direct, most long-term structured sales contracts and all coal procurement contracts are categorised as being held for the groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements and are therefore accounted for on an accruals basis because they are outside the scope of iAs 39. gtmA and isDA contracts are within the scope of iAs 39 as the group follows the industry practice of net settling these contracts.
As a result, all changes in fair value impact the consolidated income statement for those contracts which do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
the movements in fair value in the year are presented within unrealised net losses gains on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement.
British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 68 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 19.
Financial Instruments and Derivatives continued cash flow hedge accounting has been utilised wherever possible to ensure that earnings continue to be recognised in line with the groups operational strategies by reflecting the earnings effects of derivative instruments in the same period as the hedged item affects earnings.
the variability of cash flows arising from a highly probable forecast sale of electricity under an existing variable priced own use sales contract has been designated as a hedged item for cash flow hedge accounting purposes.
fair value changes of those gtmA and isDA contracts which meet the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting are deferred in equity, within the hedge reserve, until settlement of the hedging instrument or hedged item.
options contracts are recognised at fair value, with movements in fair value being presented within unrealised net losses gains on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement.
Exposures have been expressed as net positions by counterparty wherever there is the intention and ability to legally set off assets and liabilities.
i Held for Trading the group classifies as held for trading short-term contracts, contracts which are not designated as cash flow hedges and contracts which have been fide-designated from hedging relationships.
typically the term of these contracts does not exceed 12 months with prices fixed at inception.
the fair value of derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts asset and liability positions are valued, where possible, using quoted market prices.
more details on the method for determining fair value is set out in note 2 xx.
the fair value of held for trading instruments equals the book value at 31 march 2007 and 31 march 2006.
At 31 march 2007 the group had held for trading assets of 82m 2006: 26m and liabilities of 69m 2006: 11m.
the movement in the fair value in the year is presented within unrealised net losses gains on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement and totals a loss of 2m 2006: 18m gain before tax.
the principal value of held for trading derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts at 31 march 2007 was 903m 2006: 488m, of which 856m 2006: 446m falls due within one year and 47m 2006: 42m falls due after more than one year but not more than three years.
ii Hedging Relationships As at 31 march 2007, cash flow hedges were in place up to 31 march 2009 2006: up to 31 march 2007 with the uncertain cash flows on certain variable priced sales contracts being hedged by fixed price gtmA and isDA transactions.
the fair value of hedging instruments equals the book value at 31 march 2007 and at 31 march 2006.
At 31 march 2007 the group had cash flow hedging instrument assets of 23m 2006: 3m and liabilities of 20m 2006: 46m.
the movement in hedging relationships in the year was 46m 2006: 12m and is presented as a credit 2006: charge to the hedge reserve within equity.
there are no forecast transactions previously thought to be available for hedge accounting that are no longer expected to occur.
the principal value of derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts which are hedging relationships at 31 march 2007 was 259m 2006: 152m, of which 150m 2006: 152m fall due within one year and 109m 2006: nil fall due after more than one year but not more than three years.
Other Financial Assets and Liabilities the basis of valuation for the nlf and nuclear liabilities receivables is referred to in note 14. the carrying values of trade receivables, trade payables and accruals are reasonable approximations of their fair values.
the fair values of restricted cash and other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents approximates the book values due to short-term maturities.
Details of the interest rate profile of these financial assets is included in note 18.
Borrowings consist of the groups Bonds and the fair value has been estimated using the quoted closing clean market price at the balance sheet date.
Details of the interest rate and maturity profile of these financial liabilities is included in note 20. the basis of valuation of back end fuel costs is included in note 22. the book value of provisions and other charges has been used to approximate the fair value.

Financial Instruments and Derivatives continued Foreign Exchange the group uses foreign exchange contracts and other derivative instruments as deemed necessary to hedge the primary market exposures associated with the groups underlying assets, liabilities and committed transactions.
there are potential future foreign currency receivables in respect of amounts outstanding from the sale of Bruce power.
When these cash flows become more certain in the future, the group will evaluate currency hedging opportunities.
At 31 march 2007, the group had a net total of 13m 2006: nil of forward contracts in place to hedge its exposure to movements in prices of carbon allowances.
During the year ended 31 march 2007 the group had three main sources of exposure to potential foreign currency risk.
these exposures related to contracts for the purchase of coal and uranics, which are predominantly in us dollars, and the purchase of carbon allowances, which are in Euros.
the group has a number of different contracts in place to purchase coal, the most significant of which has a pricing formula that includes the specifics of the Dollar exchange rate to be used.
for details of the groups commitments to purchase coal see note 33. the group bears pass through foreign currency costs relating to the supply, conversion and enrichment of uranium at the average exchange rate relevant to the fuel supplied.
As at 31 march 2007, the group had foreign currency commitments for nuclear fuel amounting to 131m 2006: 159m out of a total fuel commitment of 1,568m 2006: 1,642m see note 33.
During the year the group has been involved in the purchase of 44m 2006: 34m of carbon allowances at the Euro foreign exchange rate ruling at the time of the transaction see note 2 ix.
Additionally the group has 81m 2006: 63m of commitments to purchase forward carbon allowances at 31 march 2007.

the loan bears interest at a rate of 7.0% 2006: 7.0% : an aggregate principal amount of 450m 2006: 492m sterling denominated guaranteed bonds due between 2008 and 2022. the bonds bear interest at a rate of 7.0% 2006: 7.0%.
the effective interest rate of the groups fixed rate borrowings is 7.0% 2006: 7.0%.
the long-term project finance loan is secured by a mortgage over the shares of Epl, an assignment of the Epl share purchase Agreement and tax Deed of covenant and a debenture comprising fixed and floating charges over Epls assets.
the bonds are supported by a guarantee provided jointly and severally on a senior basis by the company and certain subsidiaries of the group.
British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 70 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 20.
Borrowings continued the group has a receivables financing facility of up to a maximum of 60m 2006: 60m subject to the level of the groups trade receivables.
the facility contains detailed covenants which mirror those under the Bonds together with a financial interest coverage covenant.
the facility is due to expire in the year ending 31 march 2008.
During the years ended 31 march 2007 and 2006 the facility was undrawn.
During the year the group entered into two 150m committed letter of credit facilities, which contain covenants for the benefit of the facility providers, to support the collateral requirements of the groups trading business.
one of the 150m facilities expires in the year ending 31 march 2009 and was undrawn during the year ended 31 march 2007. the other 150m facility was amended in the year to effect the transfer of 50m into a separate bilateral arrangement.
Both the resulting 50m and 100m facilities expire in the year ending 31 march 2008 but with the consent of the lending banks may be extended for a further year, and were undrawn during the year ended 31 march 2007.

the pattern of payments within the hlfA were fixed subject to indexation by rpi at rED and will be funded by the government under the government indemnity.
Back End Fuel Costs Uncontracted provisions for services relating to the disposal of associated nuclear waste of both pWr and Agr stations along with the storage and disposal of pWr spent fuel are based on cost estimates derived from the latest technical assessments.
Decommissioning the costs of decommissioning the power stations have been estimated on the basis of on-going technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used for decommissioning under the current regulatory regime.
the estimates are designed to reflect the costs of making the sites of the power stations available for alternative use in accordance with the groups decommissioning strategy.

Nuclear Liabilities continued During the year ended 31 march 2007 decommissioning costs increased by 8m to reflect an increase in the level of estimated nuclear liabilities as a result of completion of the Quinquennial review.
this review was substantially completed in the year ended 31 march 2006, but still required final approval, which was received this year and resulted in the incremental 8m, which was in addition to the 956m recorded in 2006 as an ifrs 3 fair value adjustment.
As part of the restructuring arrangements, the group is indemnified by the government for any future shortfall in nlf funding of qualifying nuclear liabilities and decommissioning costs, therefore the nlf receivable has also increased by 8m.
Both increases have been reflected through operating costs and therefore there is no net impact on the consolidated income statement.
the year end balances of nuclear liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows: 2007 2006 m m Current liabilities nuclear liabilities 195 186 Non-current liabilities nuclear liabilities 5,274 5,051 Total nuclear liabilities 5,469 5,237 Projected Payment Details Based on current estimates of station lives and lifetime output projections, the following table shows, in current prices, the likely undiscounted payments, the equivalent sums discounted at 3% real per annum to the balance sheet date and the amounts accrued to date.

the differences between the discounted amounts and those accrued to date will be charged to the consolidated income statement over the remaining station lives since they relate to future use of fuel.
under the terms of the contracts with Bnfl referred to above and in accordance with the projected pattern of payments for decommissioning and other liabilities, taking account of the decommissioning fund arrangements described in note 2 xix, the undiscounted payments in current prices are expected to become payable as follows: Back end Back end fuel costs fuel costs Decom- 2007 2006 contracted uncontracted missioning Total total m m m m m Within five years 1,002 13 210 1,225 983 610 years 916 17 895 1,828 1,597 1125 years 893 153 2,095 3,141 3,382 2650 years 373 1,259 1,632 1,621 51 years and over 2,116 4,558 6,674 6,418 2,811 2,672 9,017 14,500 14,001 British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 72 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 23.

Retirement Benefit Obligations i Pension Schemes British Energy operates two separate defined benefit pension arrangements in the uK within the Electricity supply pension scheme Esps, the British Energy generation group BEgg for the majority of employees and the British Energy combined group BEcg for the employees at Eggborough power station.
the Esps is a defined benefit scheme, which is externally funded and subject to triennial actuarial valuation.
Each pension group that participates in the Esps is financially independent from the other groups.
the most recent triennial valuations of the BEgg and BEcg schemes were carried out at 31 march 2004 by the independent Esps actuary.
the valuations for accounting purposes have been carried out by a separate independent actuary using the projected unit method.
formal triennial valuations of the BEgg and the BEcg pension schemes at 31 march 2007 are currently being undertaken.
the results of these valuations will not be finalised until later in 2007 and the impact will be reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2008. initial indications suggest that the mortality assumptions may require updating following the triennial valuations.
ii Contributions British Energy contributed 22.4% 2006: 22.4% to the BEgg pension scheme and 19.7% 2006: 19.7% to the BEcg pension scheme as employers normal contributions for the year ended 31 march 2007. members who do not participate in the salary conversion arrangement and who are required to pay employee contributions contribute 5% 2006: 5% and 6% 2006: 6% to the BEgg and BEcg schemes respectively.
members who participate in the salary conversion arrangements have their salaries reduced by 5% 2006: 5% or 6% 2006: 6% depending on whether they are members of the BEgg or BEcg scheme, these monies being paid to the BEgg and BEcg schemes as additional employer contributions.
the group expects to contribute 50m of standard contributions, excluding the impact of the groups salary conversion arrangements, to the schemes in the year ending 31 march 2008.
Any deficiency disclosed in the BEgg or BEcg schemes following an actuarial valuation will be funded by the group.
Additional employer contributions were paid towards the BEgg schemes funding deficiency of 60m for the year ended 31 march 2007 2006: 69m.
the 60m 2006: 69m included 20m 2006: 19m of agreed additional contributions and 40m 2006: 50m of accelerated contributions.
At the time of the last triennial valuation it was agreed that amounts totalling 20m for the year ending 31 march 2008 will be paid towards the funding deficiency of the BEgg scheme and that these additional contributions will rise to 50.3m for the year ending 31 march 2009 and remain at that level until the year ending 31 march 2017. the requirement for additional contributions will be reviewed as part of the next triennial valuation as at 31 march 2007. the group made additional employer contributions of 1m 2006: 1m to the BEcg scheme in the year and will continue to make additional employer contributions towards the funding deficiency, having regard to appropriate funding advice.
At 31 march 2007 there was 7m 2006: 3m of contributions owed to the pension schemes included in accruals.
iii Amounts Recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet in respect of the groups funded defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2007 2006 m m fair value of plan assets 2,671 2,455 present value of funded defined benefit obligations 2,736 2,670 Retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated balance sheet 65 215 certain additional retirement benefits are provided to eligible employees.
these obligations are unfunded and the liability recorded at 31 march 2007 was 5m 2006: 3m and is included within other provisions see note 23.

the major categories of plan assets and their expected rates of return are as follows: 2007 2006 Expected Expected return 2007 return 2006 % m % m Equities 8.30 1,326 7.90 1,438 Bonds 4.80 865 4.40 565 property 6.55 270 6.15 251 hedge funds 6.80 103 6.40 94 other 5.00 107 4.00 107 Total 2,671 2,455 the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was developed with consideration to the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
the actual return on plan assets was 170m 2006: 448m, 6m 2006: 312m in excess of the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year.
changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are as follows: 2007 2006 m m opening defined benefit obligations 2,670 2,343 current service cost 68 52 past service cost 9 4 interest cost 131 126 contributions by plan participants 7 7 Actuarial gains losses 63 224 Benefits paid 86 86 Closing defined benefit obligations 2,736 2,670 9m 2006: 4m and 1m 2006: nil have been contributed to the pension schemes from the groups severance provisions established in previous years in relation to past service costs and current service costs respectively.

vii Amounts Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense Amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in respect of the retirement benefit obligations are as follows: Year ended year ended 31 March 31 march 2007 2006 m m Actual return less expected return on pension plan assets 6 312 Experience losses gains arising on defined benefit obligations 25 16 changes in assumptions underlying present value of defined benefit obligations 88 240 Actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations for the year 69 88 the cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses, before deferred tax, recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in respect of funded retirement benefit obligations is 239m 2006: 170m.
An actuarial loss of 1m 2006: nil has also been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in respect of the unfunded pension scheme, therefore the total actuarial gain taken to equity is 68m see note 28.

Called Up Share Capital continued Convertible Shares the nlf has the right from time to time to convert all or part of its entitlement to the cash sweep payment into convertible shares in the company the nlf conversion right.
subsequent to a conversion, the nlf may dispose of its convertible shares which on disposal become ordinary shares at any time subject to certain restrictions.
Amongst other things, the nlf may not exercise the nlf conversion right or dispose of any convertible shares if such disposal would require British Energy to have produced listing particulars or a prospectus more than five times in a consecutive period of 7.5 years.
the convertible shares may only be held by nuclear liabilities fund limited or its successor in title, a minister of the crown, the treasury, a department, nondepartmental body or other agency of the crown, any body corporate established by statute some or all of the members of which are appointed by a minister of the crown or other uK government entity or any person directly or indirectly wholly owned by, or held on trust for, the secretary of state or other minister of the crown.
save in respect of voting rights, the convertible shares have the same rights, are subject to the same restrictions and rank pari passu with the ordinary shares of the company in all respects.
the number of votes that the holder of the convertible shares is entitled to exercise in respect of its holding of convertible shares is the lesser of: i 29.9% and, for this purpose, taking into account the voting rights attributable to any other ordinary shares held or acquired by any person acting in concert with the holder : and ii the number of convertible shares which the holder would otherwise be entitled to vote if the convertible shares were ordinary shares.
the convertible shares will convert into ordinary shares of the company automatically on transfer to a third party by the holder but are not convertible at the election of the holder prior to such a transfer.
Special Rights Redeemable Preference Share of 1 the special share is redeemable at par at any time after 30 september 2006 at the option of the secretary of state, after consulting the company.
this share, which may only be held by and transferred to one or more of her majestys secretaries of state, another minister of the crown, the solicitor for the affairs of her majestys treasury or any other person acting on behalf of the crown, does not carry any rights to vote at general meetings, but entitles the holder to attend and speak at such meetings.

the consent of the holder of the special share is required for certain matters including the alteration or removal of the provisions in the companys Articles of Association relating to the special share and to the limitations on shareholdings.
in addition, consent of the holder of the special share is required in relation to, amongst others, certain amendments to the Articles of Association of British Energy holdings plc, British Energy limited, British Energy generation limited or British Energy generation uK limited, or a disposal by the company of its shares in these companies.
however, the holder of the special share will only be entitled to withhold consent to such an amendment or disposal if, in the holders opinion, the matter in question would be contrary to the interests of national security.

iii Capital Reserve the restructuring involved bondholders and significant creditors compromising their claims against the group in exchange for, amongst other things, the issue of Bonds see note 20 by British Energy holdings plc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and new ordinary shares of the company.
the capital reserve was created on the issue of shares at rED and represents the excess of the fair value of the claims of the significant creditors and bondholders over the legal liability foregone.
the capital reserve is not distributable.
iv Hedge Reserve the 46m gain 2006: 12m loss in the hedge reserve in the year reflects the fair value movement, before the deferred tax charge of 14m 2006: 3m credit, of the contracts that have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
this movement comprises a 3m net gain 2006: 31m net loss on hedging instruments recognised in the period, plus 43m 2006: 19m removed from the hedge reserve and included in the consolidated income statement.
Where hedge accounting is permitted, gains and losses on hedging instruments are recognised directly in equity until the contract is settled, at which point the gain or loss is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
When trades are fide-designated as hedging instruments, cumulative gains or losses are retained in equity until the forecast transaction is settled.

Share-based Payments the expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year ended 31 march 2007 was 2m 2006: 3m see note 6 and related entirely to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Details of each of the employee share plans are given below.
Share Incentive Plan under the share incentive plan sip, employees, including the Executive Directors, who are resident in the uK and meet the service requirements, are eligible for awards under the sip.
Awards under the sip are limited each year by relevant tax legislation and for the year ended 31 march 2007 will take the form of free shares.
the value of the annual awards is linked to performance conditions which for the year ended 31 march 2007 relate to output, uclf and an outage indicator.
these are considered to be non-market conditions under ifrs 2 and dividends attach to the awards, therefore the shares are fair valued at the market value on the date of grant.
the free shares are initially held in a trust and vest unconditionally for participating employees after being held within the trust for three years contingent upon participants being in continued employment by the group.
Any dividends paid on shares held within the trust are converted into additional shares.
the following table illustrates the number and movements in, share awards under this scheme during the year: 2007 2006 Number number granted during the year 764,308 forfeited during the year 15,375 Unvested at 31 March 748,933 the fair value of shares granted during the year was 6.93 per share.

Share-based Payments continued Long Term Deferred Bonus Plan the long term Deferred Bonus plan lt plan is available to certain Executive Directors and selected senior executives who are eligible to receive conditionally awarded options in shares in the company at nil cost.
the value of the award is subject to the achievement of performance targets which for the year ended 31 march 2007 were based on output and uclf.
the share options vest over a three year period from the date of grant and the contractual life of each option granted is 10 years.
in the first year of each new award, awards for Executive Directors will comprise a combination of cash and share options and in the second and third years all awards will be entirely comprised of share options.
the following table illustrates the number and movements in share options under this scheme during the year: 2007 2006 Number number granted during the year 296,301 forfeited during the year 1,672 Exercised 17,777 Outstanding at 31 March 276,852 Exercisable at 31 March 57,256 the fair value of options granted during the year was 4.86. the weighted average share price of options exercised during the year was 4.65 per share.
the remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 31 march 2007 was 9.7 years.
An amendment to the lt plan was approved by shareholders at the Agm on 20 september 2006 meaning that awards under this scheme can now be satisfied by treasury or market purchased shares, in addition to a new issue of shares.
the modification to the lt plan did not result in a significant increment to the level of remuneration granted under the scheme.
Deferred Incentive Plan the Deferred incentive plan Dip is available to selected senior employees who are eligible to receive conditionally awarded options in shares in the company at nil cost.
the value of the award is subject to the achievement of performance targets which for the year ended 31 march 2007 were based on a number of operational and financial measures.
the share options vest over a period of between one and three years from the date of grant dependant on the percentage of performance targets achieved and the contractual life of each option granted is 10 years.
the level of the Dip awards for the year ended 31 march 2007 will be based on a cash award of 2m 2006: nil which has been calculated using an expected performance payout of 44%.
this cash will be used to purchase shares after the announcement of the companys results for the year ended 31 march 2007. the number of options to be awarded is calculated by dividing the value of the award, calculated as a proportion of salary, by the average share price of British Energy group plc based on the 60 business days of share trading prior the award date.
As at the date of this report, the number of options awarded is still to be determined.
British Energy Executive Share Option Plan 2004 the British Energy Executive share option plan 2004 is available to certain full-time directors or qualifying employees.
the following table illustrates the number and the exercise prices of, and movements in, share options under this scheme during the year: Weighted Weighted average average exercise price exercise price 2007 2007 2006 2006 Number number outstanding at 1 April 240,000 5.00 granted during the year 275,000 4.80 240,000 5.00 Outstanding at 31 March 515,000 4.89 240,000 5.00 Exercisable at 31 March British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 82 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 30.
Share-based Payments continued these options were granted on 24 november 2006 and 20 December 2005 and are dependent on a performance condition based on nuclear output during the financial year ending 31 march 2008. subject to this performance condition the options granted will vest on the third anniversary of the dates of the grants, on 24 november 2009 and 20 December 2008 respectively.
the contractual life of each option granted is 10 years.
the weighted average remaining contractual lives of options outstanding at 31 march 2007 was 9.2 years.

the awards were based on a proportion of salary and vest over a three year period, with one third of the award vesting immediately, one third after one year and the final third after two years.
the following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, share options under this scheme during the year.
the exercise price of these options is nil.
2007 2006 Number number outstanding at 1 April 101,910 124,263 settled during the year 44,704 Exercised 22,353 Outstanding at 31 March 57,206 101,910 Exercisable at 31 March 38,138 19,070 the remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 31 march 2007 was 8.3 years.
Share Option Schemes Granted by British Energy Limited share options were granted in previous years by British Energy limited.
legal advice has been obtained to the effect that the changes in the corporate structure of the group as a result of the restructuring did not trigger the early exercise provisions under these options.
the remuneration committee decided not to allow holders of the options in British Energy limited to roll them over into options over shares in the company.
the options granted by British Energy limited are still capable of exercise, but immediately on exercise the shares will be converted into shares in the company in the ratio of 50:1.
Accordingly the effective exercise price of the options is significantly higher than the current share price and it is unlikely the options will be exercised.
Contingent Assets the group has certain contingent assets as a result of its disposal of its 82.4% interest in Bruce power lp.
in addition to the consideration payable by the consortium under the master purchase agreement, up to a further c$100m was payable to British Energy contingent upon the restart of two of the Bruce A units under a trust agreement the trust Agreement entered into on the same date.
had the first unit restarted by 15 June 2003, c$50m would have been released to British Energy and an additional c$50m would have been released to British Energy had the second unit restarted by 1 August 2003.
An amount of c$5m was to be deducted from the c$50m payable in respect of each unit for its failure to restart by the scheduled restart date or by the first day of each successive calendar month following the scheduled restart date.
the group received c$20m on 22 march 2004 and c$10m on 25 may 2004 in partial consideration under the trust Agreement.
British Energy commenced arbitration proceedings in ontario against the ontario provincial government the province in December 2004 seeking the payment of additional consideration under the trust Agreement on the basis that Bruce A units 3 and 4 restarted earlier than the dates claimed by the province.
no additional amounts appear on the consolidated balance sheet at 31 march 2007 because of uncertainties regarding their realisation.
the amounts recoverable in respect of the restarted units will be substantially lower than the maximum c$100m but the amounts and timing of the payments have still to be confirmed.
the treatment of expenditure at the Bruce power station during the period of the groups part ownership is currently being considered by the canadian tax authorities and could result in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the group see note 32. f i n A n c i A l s tAt E m E n t s British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 83 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 32.
Contingent Liabilities on 12 february 2004 British Energy limited and British Energy international holdings limited received a notice of warranty claims from the consortium which purchased the groups 82.4% interest in Bruce power lp alleging breach of certain warranties and representations relating to tax and to the condition of certain plant at the Bruce power station.
the principal tax claim relates to the treatment of expenditure at the Bruce power station during the period of the groups part ownership and is currently being considered by the canadian tax authorities.
the treatment proposed by the group could result in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the group that has not been recognised in the consolidated financial statements: it is impracticable to provide an estimate of the potential amount of the tax rebate.
the consortium claims that allowance of the expenditure for that period would cause it to lose future deductions.
British Energy international holdings limited has rejected the tax claim and expects to defend it if it is pursued further.
the group is confident that the amount of the claim should not, in any event, materially exceed the amount of the rebate, and that the tax claim should have no material cash flow impact on the group.
the claim relating to the condition of the plant is based upon alleged erosion of certain parts of the steam generators, including the support plates, through which boiler tubes pass, which it is alleged resulted in an extended outage of one unit at the plant to carry out repair works and loss of revenues and costs of approximately c$64.5m.
the consortium also claims that the alleged erosion may reduce the operating life of the unit and or result in further repairs involving further losses.
on 10 february 2006, British Energy limited and British Energy international holdings limited filed a notice of Action against ontario power generation opg and Bruce power lp with the ontario superior court of Justice seeking a contribution and indemnity from opg and Bruce power lp with respect to any amounts for which British Energy limited or British Energy international holdings limited may be found liable as a result of the steam generator claim brought on 12 february 2004 by the consortium which acquired British Energy limiteds 82.4% interest in the Bruce power plant.
on 7 December 2006, the consortium served a notice of arbitration on British Energy limited and British Energy international holdings limited in relation to the purchase price payable by the consortium on the purchase of Bruce power lp.
under the disposal arrangements, the parties agreed a post-completion adjustment to the purchase price to account for the value of the Bruce power pension plan as determined by a mutually appointed actuarial advisor.
the consortium alleges that the valuation was incorrect, resulting in British Energy benefiting by c$23.1m which the consortium is now claiming together with interest and costs.
British Energy expects to defend the claim.
the consortium has also commenced legal proceedings against the actuaries responsible for evaluating the Bruce power pension plan and post-completion adjustment to the purchase price payable by the consortium.
on 15 may 2007, the defendants in the consortiums legal action served notice of a third party action on British Energy limited and British Energy international holdings limited seeking an indemnity against any amounts for which the defendants may be found liable approximately c$23.1m together with interest and costs.
if the consortium is successful in its action against the actuaries, it is very unlikely that the arbitration commenced by it against British Energy in December 2006 will proceed.
under the agreement with the consortium c$20m is retained in trust to meet any representation and warranty claims, and this may be retained pending agreement or determination of the claims.
the group has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of its subsidiary undertakings.
no losses are anticipated to arise under these indemnities and guarantees, provided relevant subsidiary undertakings continue on a going concern basis.
the group is involved in a number of other claims and disputes arising in the normal course of business which are not expected to have a material effect on the groups financial position.

of this, 3m tonnes 2006: 2m tonnes with an approximate value of 116m 2006: 77m falls due within one year and 1m tonnes 2006: 2m tonnes with an approximate value of 23m 2006: 65m falls due after more than one year but not more than three years.
in addition to the liabilities and provisions recognised and described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the group has provided certain guarantees and commitments in respect of the extent of capital expenditure by Eggborough power limited.
the group also enters into commitments to purchase and sell electricity in the normal course of business.
the group has a commitment to make the cash sweep payment as described in note 2 xvii.
therefore, it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable.
Related Parties the company is a public limited company owned by our shareholders and operates within an extensive contractual framework established as part of the restructuring.
the most significant contract, in terms of the limitations it places on the business, is the contribution Agreement between the secretary of state and the company.
