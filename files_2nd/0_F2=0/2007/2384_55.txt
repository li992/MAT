The provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% 2006 2.0%.
These costs are generally expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount is reliably determinable.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% 2006 2.0%.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.

They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
Included within the litigation and other category at 31 December 2007 are provisions for litigation of $1,737 million 2006 $1,474 million for deferred employee compensation of $761 million 2006 $760 million and provisions for expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties of $320 million 2006 $320 million.

To the extent that these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 4.5% 2006 4.5% or a real discount rate of 2.0% 2006 2.0%, as appropriate.
