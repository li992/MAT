Notes to the financial statements Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 7 March 2008.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale assets which are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 29.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Accounting policies Business combinations The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of or consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given and liabilities taken on or assumed in return for the acquisition plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
On acquisition, identifiable assets and liabilities are measured initially at fair value, with any excess of consideration being recognised as goodwill.
Accounting policies of subsidiary undertakings have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with those adopted by the Group.
Revenue Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties and land is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion of the sale transaction.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenditure.
Net financing costs Net finance costs comprise: interest payable on borrowings, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: interest receivable on funds invested accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: dividend income recognised on the date the right to receive payments is established: pension finance costs or benefits being the net of interest costs on liabilities and expected return on assets linked to the Defined Benefit Scheme: and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Accounting policies continued Taxation Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts where deemed appropriate to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
Where the derivative instrument, typically an interest rate swap, is deemed an effective hedge over the exposure being hedged, the derivative instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge and hedge accounting applied.
Under a cash flow hedge, gains and losses on the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Goodwill Where the fair value of consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the excess is recognised as goodwill arising on consolidation and is capitalised as an asset.
Once capitalised, this asset is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment arising requiring immediate recognition in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost as deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, this being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Regular reviews of the carrying values of property are completed to assess any impairment in value.
When impairment is identified, the assets recoverable amount is assessed and any shortfall is written off through the income statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value which is reassessed annually of assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is charged on property in respect of the value of the building.
The basis of depreciation for each class of asset is as follows: Buildings straight line over 50 years Plant and machinery 33.3% reducing balance Computer equipment straight line over 3 years Office equipment 25% reducing balance The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Following the issue of IFRIC8 in 2007, the parent company accounts for the share-based payments granted to subsidiary employees as an increase in the cost of its investment in subsidiaries.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 53 Notes to the financial statements continued 4.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, no adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date.
Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option.
The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Available for sale financial assets At each balance sheet date, these financial assets are measured at fair value.
Movements in this fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the asset is divested.
At point of disposal, the difference between carrying value and the consideration received plus cumulative fair value movements previously recognised in equity, is recognised in the income statement.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.
Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2: Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS1, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products and services business segment, or in providing products and services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied The Group has not applied IFRS8: Operating segments in these financial statements.
This standard is available for early adoption and is applicable for years commencing on or after 1 January 2009.

Goodwill The Goodwill balance relates to the acquisition of Elite Homes Group Ltd during 2007.
Goodwill has arisen as a result of two main factors.
Firstly, synergy arising from the integration of and subsequent rationalisation of Elite Homes with the existing Bovis Homes Northern region as a result of the overlap and duplication of the organisational structures existing alongside each other in the North West and Yorkshire in a highly replicated way.
Secondly, the acquisition has allowed the Group access to the expertise and contacts of the Elite Homes land buying team which the Group anticipates will offer future strategic and consented land opportunities.
The Group has performed an impairment review on Elite Homes, and is satisfied that its recoverable amount as determined by value-in-use calculations is in excess of the carrying value of assets and liabilities, together with the goodwill arising on consolidation.
The key assumptions for this include a discount rate of 7.0% based on the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and the internal management forecasts covering the period determined by the full utilisation of the existing consented land bank.
These forecasts were generated at the point of acquisition, using forward looking estimates and growth rates based on market assessments made at the time of the transaction, and have been reviewed following the first quarters trading.
For the purposes of this review the goodwill has been allocated to the cash generation unit of Elite Homes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Group Assets Liabilities Net 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 259 310 56 61 203 249 Non current trade payables 3,098 2,974 - - 3,098 2,974 Interest rate swaps - 48 - - - 48 Employee benefits - pensions - 1,542 282 - 282 1,542 Employee benefits - share-based payments 364 1,137 - - 364 1,137 Provisions 159 139 - - 159 139 Fair value adjustment - - 309 - 309 - Tax assets liabilities 3,880 6,150 647 61 3,233 6,089 The Finance Bill 2007, which has been substantively enacted, changes the UK Corporation Tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
As a result, the balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2007 reflects a deferred tax asset 230,000 lower as a result of the Group's deferred tax balances being revised by the application of 28% in place of 30% as the rate at which timing differences are expected to reverse.

The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2007, 11,066,000 2006: 9,913,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a surplus of 1.0 million.
As at 31 December 2007 a deferred tax liability of 282,000 was recognised.

As at 31 December 2007, the Group had 1.9 million of receivables past due.
The Group has reviewed the items which comprise this balance, and believes that these amounts will be recovered.
As part of this exercise the Group has provided for receivables it regards as doubtful.
The total of this provision is 0.1 million.
The carrying value of amounts due from subsidary undertakings represents the Companys maximum credit risk.
The directors consider these amounts to be fully receivable at year end.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale assets relate to legal completions where the Group has retained a stake in the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Groups position.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of available for sale assets on initial recognition reflects fair value as the time value of money and credit risks are taken into account when assessing carrying value.

These fair value adjustments are provisional and will be confirmed within 1 year of the transaction.
Elite Homes contributed 16.7 million of revenue and 2.9 million to gross profit for the period 12 October to 31 December 2007.
Had the acquisition been made on the first day of 2007, the combined revenue of the Group would have been 593.5 million and the combined operating profit would have been 125.7 million.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 31 December 2007 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 86,859,000 2006: 95,038,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2007 of 119,984,811 2006: 119,103,010, calculated as follows: Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 2007 2006 000 000 Profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 86,859 95,038 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 2007 2006 Issued ordinary shares at 1 January 120,576,542 119,398,936 Effect of own shares held 712,139 775,381 Effect of shares issued in year 120,408 479,455 Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 119,984,811 119,103,010 Diluted earnings per share The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 31 December 2007 was based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 86,859,000 2006: 95,038,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2007 of 120,244,911 2006: 119,523,151.
The average number of shares is diluted in reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts, and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Hedging The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on which management form judgements.
These matters include management's view of likely cashflows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and other macroeconomic factors looking ahead.
These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision being made.
Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making.
At 31 December 2007, the Group held no interest rate swaps.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 19.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 491,000 year ended 31 December 2006: decrease of 140,000. Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding is 7.3 million 2006: 4.5 million.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade receivables, the carrying value of which equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 19 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
Capital management The Board's objective in managing capital is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to underpin the future development of the business in the interests of the shareholders.
In order to maintain or adjust the Group's capital structure, the company may, from time to time, raise new medium or long term debt, or issue new shares.
From time to time, the Company may purchase its own shares in the market: the timing of which may depend on market prices.
Financial instruments Fair values There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.

Interest rate swaps At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
70 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
co. uk plc Notes to the financial statements continued Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
For the year ended 31 December 2007 the interest rate used to discount was 6.5% year ended 31 December 2006: 6.4%.

Contingencies The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bonds and other agreements entered into in the normal course of business and the Company has guaranteed the performance of certain of these agreements entered into by its subsidiary companies.
The Company had guaranteed the repayment of bank loans made to one of its subsidiaries under bilateral loan facility agreements which amounted to 41 million at 31 December 2007 31 December 2006: 40 million.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a recoverable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
Based on the appraisals completed at or close to the year end, there were no net realisable value write offs necessary and management remain content that the inventory values are fully recoverable.
Part exchange properties The carrying values of part exchange properties are assessed based on external valuations completed on the properties.
These valuations are based on the prevailing market conditions in the second hand housing market and to the extent that housing market pricing levels change, the values of the part exchange properties may vary.
Part exchange property values at the end of the financial year were based on recent valuations and were based on realistic market expectations.
Financial instruments The Group mitigates its exposure to interest rates through using interest rate swaps where appropriate.
These interest rate swaps are held at their fair value.
This fair value is based on the likely income or cost associated with terminating the swap at the balance sheet date.
Where interest rates are volatile, the fair value of the interest rate swaps may vary as interest rates change.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps reflected the interest rate position at the balance sheet date.
Pension assumptions The Group has utilised a range of assumptions including a rate of return on assets, a discount rate and mortality assumptions having been advised by its actuary.
To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
Goodwill At least annually, the Group assesses its goodwill to understand whether impairment is indicated.
This assessment requires judgement in estimating future cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate by which to perform a value-in-use calculation and so to determine the present value of cash flows and thus recoverable amounts.
