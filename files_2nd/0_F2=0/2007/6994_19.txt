EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 19 and has been adjusted for the issue repurchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 30 March 2007.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value of derivative financial instruments The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest swaps.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on future expected purchases.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency transactions, which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts, are translated at the contracted rates.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or borrowings effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.

Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 30 March 2007 will be released to the income statement at various dates between one and thirteen months from the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 30 March 2007 was 70m 2006: 120m.
At 30 March 2007 the fixed interest rate was 5.165% and the floating rate is LIBOR.
Treasury policy The Groups objective in using financial instruments is to minimise its exposure to financial risk.
The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group: and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
The main risk arising from the Groups financial instruments is interest rate risk.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The latest policy review was performed in December 2006.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the next three to five years at a reasonable cost and ensure adequate flexibility to meet the changing needs of the enterprise.
Financial risk The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of the trading profit and the strength of the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The Group maintains its policy to minimise interest rate risk on its borrowings and deposits by using interest rate derivatives where appropriate.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The aim is to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rates movements by hedging at least 40% of the following periods net interest rate exposure, whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct source purchases of its supplies from the Far East, with most of the trade being specifically US dollar denominated.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business for a minimum period of twelve months forward to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling business whilst they remain immaterial.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise the risk that foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties, the holders of surplus cash and the providers of debt will be unable to fulfil their obligations and also, in the case of lenders, unwilling to renegotiate the terms of the borrowings.
The Group ensures that such counterparties used for credit transactions hold at least an A credit rating.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when required.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient funding to meet its Business Plan requirements so that it is not reliant on there being sufficient liquidity in the market when it needs the funding.
Fair values of non-derivative financial liabilities The following table is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 30 March 2007 and 31 March 2006.

Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

On 17 May 2007 the Company applied for block listing of a total of 6,000,000 ordinary shares of 1p each to be admitted on allotment to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trade on the London Stock Exchange market for listed securities.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS At present the Group has three share award plans: 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOP 2.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP 1.
The Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOP was introduced in June 2004.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three-year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 6% for 2004 05 grants, 5% for 2005 06 grants and 3.5% for 2006 07 grants.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
For increases in excess of 6% but less than 10% a proportion of the option in excess of 150% of salary can be exercised.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
Grants in excess of 150% of salary have only been made under the 2004 05 scheme.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations were as follows: Grant Date 6 July 2006 13 July 2005 2 June 2004 Share price at grant date 3.010 2.955 2.600 Exercise price 3.010 2.955 2.600 Number of employees 36 42 3,598 Shares under option 252,000 294,000 6,556,953 Vesting period years 333 Expected volatility 35% 37% 40% Option life years 10 10 10 Expected life years 4.85 4.85 3.85 Risk-free rate 4.70% 4.68% 4.68% Expected dividend yield 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 32% 32% 34% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% Fair value per option 0.77 0.79 0.70 Number of options outstanding at 30 March 2007 252,000 259,000 4,709,030 2.

The Long-Term Incentive Plan The introduction of a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
To date two schemes have been approved for 2005 06 and 2006 07.
The extent to which rights vest will depend upon the Groups performance over the subsequent three financial years.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Groups relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Groups absolute earnings per share performance against RPI.
The Groups TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator group.
No retesting will be permitted.
