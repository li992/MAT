Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Basis of Preparation a Accounting standards applied The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
For these purposes, IFRS comprise the Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC that have been endorsed by the European Union EU.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except as follows: IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
This standard will require different disclosures relating to the Groups operating segments and how these are identified when it comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This interpretation requires the present classification of certain assets acquired through the Groups water concession within property, plant and equipment, to be reassessed when it comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008. b Change in accounting policy and adoption of new accounting standards i The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 January 2007.
From that date, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows have been recognised directly in equity, with any ineffective portion recognised immediately in the income statement.
Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement have been recorded within turnover.
Prior to 1 January 2007 derivatives were measured at fair value through the income statement, with gains or losses on commodity derivatives being recorded within other operating income or expense.
This change in accounting policy must be applied prospectively and accordingly no restatement of prior period information is required.
ii The Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which is effective from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 82 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Principal Accounting Policies a Accounting convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the use of fair values to measure certain financial instruments, principally provisionally priced sales as explained in Note 2 d and financial derivative contracts as explained in Note 2 s. b Basis of consolidation The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Antofagasta plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively the Group.
i Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating inter-company balances and transactions.
For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net earnings attributable to minority shareholders are presented as Minority Interests in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or jointly control, through the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity.
The Groups share of the net assets, the results post tax and post acquisition reserves of associates are included in the financial statements.
This requires recording the investment initially at cost to the Group and then, in subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the Groups share of the associates results less any impairment of goodwill and any other changes to the associates net assets such as dividends.
iii Jointly controlled entities A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and shares joint control over the operating and financial decisions with one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using proportionate consolidation, which combines the Groups share of the results of the jointly controlled entity on a line by line basis with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
iv Other investments The accounting treatment of investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities is set out in Note 2 s relating to other financial instruments.
v Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions and disposals are treated as explained in Note 2 e relating to business combinations and goodwill.
c Currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions other than those in the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are retranslated at year end exchange rates.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period within other finance items.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 83 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued c Currency translation continued The presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Company is the US dollar.
On consolidation, income statement items for entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on translation of the net assets of such entities are taken to equity and recorded in a separate currency translation reserve.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition date to IFRS are recognised as income or as expenses in the income statement in the period in which an operation is disposed of.
On consolidation, exchange gains and losses which arise on balances between Group entities are taken to reserves where that balance is, in substance, part of a parents net investment in its subsidiary, i. e. where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
All other exchange gains and losses on Group balances are dealt with in the income statement.
Fair value adjustments and any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the period end rate.
d Revenue recognition Turnover represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties during the year.
Turnover is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, and excludes any applicable sales tax.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed.
This is generally when title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location or when any services have been provided.
Turnover from mining activities is recorded at the invoiced amounts with an adjustment for provisional pricing at each reporting date, as explained below.
For copper and molybdenum concentrates, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing, the invoiced amount is the market value of the metal payable by the customer, net of deductions for tolling charges.
Turnover includes revenues from the sale of by-products.
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange LME copper price or the monthly average market molybdenum price for specified future periods.
This normally ranges from 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer.
Such a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is required to be separated from the host contract.
The host contract is the sale of metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the provisional invoice price less tolling charges deducted, and the embedded derivative is the forward contract for which the provisional sale is subsequently adjusted.
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal sales together with any related tolling charges are marked-to-market, with adjustments both gains and losses being recorded in turnover in the consolidated income statement and in trade debtors in the balance sheet.
Forward prices at the period end are used for copper concentrate and cathode sales, while period-end average prices are used for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment have been established.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued e Business combinations and goodwill i Acquisitions The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, joint venture entity or an associate which can be measured reliably are recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition.
Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
ii Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is separately disclosed, while any goodwill on the acquisition of associates is included within investments in equity accounted entities.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
Where the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired exceed the cost of the acquisition, the surplus which represents the discount on the acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
iii Disposals The results of businesses sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period up to the effective date of disposal.
Gains or losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sales proceeds net of expenses and the net assets attributable to the interest which has been sold.
Where a disposal represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, the net results attributable to the disposed entity are shown separately in the income statement.
f Intangible assets i Concession right In 2003, the Groups wholly owned subsidiary, Aguas fide Antofagasta S. A. was awarded a 30 year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile previously controlled by Empresa fide Servicios Sanitarios fide Antofagasta S. A. ESSAN.
The Group has recognised on its balance sheet the tangible assets transferred to it by way of concession where the economic benefits are primarily to be consumed over the life of the concession arrangement.
An intangible asset a concession right has been recognised in respect of the right to use those assets not recognised as their lives extend substantially beyond the period of the concession.
The concession right was measured as the difference between the cost of the concession and the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition.
ii Exploration licences In 2006, the Group acquired Tethyan Copper Company Limited Tethyan, a company with copper-gold interests in Pakistan, and entered into a joint venture over Tethyans mineral interests with Barrick Gold Corporation through the disposal of a 50% interest in Tethyan.
An intangible asset has been recognised for the Groups proportionate share of the full unencumbered value attributed to the interest in the exploration licences held by Tethyan in Pakistan.
g Exploration expenditure Exploration is expensed in the year in which it is incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining project is commercially viable normally when the project has reached the pre-feasibility stage all further directly attributable pre-production expenditure is capitalised.
Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 85 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued h Property, plant and equipment The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the year in which they are incurred.
The cost of plant, property and equipment comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended.
Once a project has been established as commercially viable, related development expenditure is capitalised.
This includes costs incurred in preparing the site for mining operations, including pre-stripping costs.
Capitalisation ceases when the mine is capable of commercial production, with the exception of development costs which give rise to a future benefit.
Interest on borrowings directly related to construction or development of projects is capitalised, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale which, in the case of mining properties, is when they are capable of commercial production.
i Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the operation if shorter, to residual value.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: i Land Freehold land is not depreciated.
Any leasehold land is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Mining properties mining properties, including capitalised financing costs, are depreciated on a unit of ii production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable reserves at the beginning of the year.
iii Buildings and infrastructure straight-line basis over 10 to 25 years.
iv Railway track including trackside equipment straight-line basis over 20 to 25 years.
v Wagons and rolling stock straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years.
vi Machinery, equipment and other assets straight-line basis over 5 to 10 years.
vii Assets under construction no depreciation until asset is available for use.
viii Assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at least annually, and changes to residual values and useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
The concession right is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession.
j Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 86 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued j Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill continued For mining properties, estimates of future cash flows are based on estimates of the quantities of proven and probable reserves, and assumptions as to future production levels, commodity prices, cash costs of production and capital expenditure.
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets includes a number of restrictions on the future cash flows that can be recognised in respect of future restructurings and improvement related expenditure.
When calculating value in use, it also requires that calculations should be based on exchange rates current at the time of assessment.
For operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is conducted in the relevant functional currency.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of recoverable amount, but so that the increase carrying amount does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined if no impairment had previously been recognised.
A reversal is recognised in the income statement immediately.
k Investment property Investment property is property held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation and includes land held for a currently undetermined future use.
The Group has elected to adopt the cost model in IAS 40 Investment Property.
Accordingly, investment property is measured initially at cost, which includes transaction costs for the acquisition of the property and, as detailed in Note 2 i relating to property, plant and equipment, is not depreciated.
l Inventory Inventory and work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The production cost of inventory includes an appropriate proportion of depreciation and production overheads.
Raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a weighted average basis.
Finished products are valued at raw material cost, plus labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses including depreciation.
m Taxation Tax expense comprises the charges or credits for the period relating to both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit may differ from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable and deductible in different years and also excludes items that are not taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates for each entity in the consolidated financial statements which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences i. e. differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences with certain limited exceptions as follows: i tax payable on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is provided except where the Group is able to control the remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance of past profits earned in the foreseeable future: ii deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not affect accounting profit or taxable profit and is not a business combination: nor is deferred tax provided on subsequent changes in the carrying value of such assets and liabilities, for example where they are depreciated: and Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 87 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued m Taxation continued iii the initial recognition of any goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered through sufficient future taxable profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to equity.
n Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs An obligation to incur decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs occurs when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property.
Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular formal review.
Such costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are provided and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These decommissioning costs are charged against profits over the life of the mine, through depreciation of the asset and unwinding or amortisation of the discount on the provision.
Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding of the discount is included as financing costs.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period.
The costs for restoration of site damage, which is created on an ongoing basis during production, are provided for at their net present values and charged against operating profits as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to site damage created during production is charged against operating profit.
o Provision for termination of water concession Under the terms of the water concession from ESSAN, certain items of working capital recognised by Aguas fide Antofagasta as described in Note 2 f above are to be transferred to the state-owned operator ESSAN at the end of the concession period for nil consideration.
Provision is made for the estimated net present value of these assets and liabilities which are expected to be in existence when the concession comes to an end.
The unwinding of the discount is charged within financing costs.
p Post-employment benefits The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees.
For such schemes, the amount charged to the income statement is the contributions paid or payable in the year.
Employment terms may also provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to an end.
This is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service and based on final salary level.
The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the calculation is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method which are regularly updated.
The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the severance indemnity obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in the income statement within operating cost.
q Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net of bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand.
Cash and cash equivalents normally have a maturity period of three months or less.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 88 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued r Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement account in equal annual amounts over the term of the lease.
Assets under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by discounting at the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element is charged within financing costs so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
s Other financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Investments Investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available for sale, and are normally measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 24 b.
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.
Securities are classified as held-for-trading when they are acquired principally for the purpose of sale in the short-term, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
Other investments are classified as available-for-sale, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, within the Fair value reserve, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Dividends on available for sale equity investments are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
ii Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables do not generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal value less any impairment.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised within an allowance account unless the Group considers that no recovery of the amount is possible, in which case the carrying value of the asset is reduced directly.
iii Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are generally not interest bearing and are normally stated at their nominal value.
iv Borrowings loans and preference shares Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Amounts are either recorded as financing costs in the income statement or capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2 h. Finance charges are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued s Other financial instruments continued The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus.
They are accordingly classified within borrowings and translated into US dollars at period end rates of exchange.
Preference share dividends are included within finance costs.
v Equity instruments Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments of the Company comprise its sterling-denominated issued ordinary share capital and related share premium.
As explained in Note 2 c, the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated into US dollars at historical rates of exchange based on dates of issue.
vi Derivative financial instruments As explained in Note 24, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price movements.
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for trading purposes.
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 January 2007.
From that date, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement are recorded within turnover.
The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income statement within other finance items.
Prior to 1 January 2007 derivatives were measured at fair value through the income statement, with gains or losses on commodity derivatives being recorded within other operating income or expense, and gains or losses on interest and exchange derivatives being recorded within net finance costs.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value are reported in the income statement for the period.
The treatment of embedded derivatives arising from provisionally-priced commodity sales contracts is set out in further detail in Note 2 d relating to turnover.
vii Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For loans and receivables the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables.
With the exception of available-for-sale equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 90 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued s Other financial instruments continued extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of available-for-sale equity instruments, any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
3 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty Determining many of the amounts included in the financial statements involves the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimates is included in the principal accounting policies in Note 2 or the other notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are set out below.
a Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment and ore reserve estimates As explained in Note 2 i, mining properties, including capitalised financing costs, are depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable reserves at the beginning of the year.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change when new information becomes available.
These include assumptions as to grade estimates and cut-off grades, recovery rates, commodity prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation costs and discount rates.
The actual volume of ore extracted and any changes in these assumptions could affect prospective depreciation rates and carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the appropriateness of useful economic lives at least annually and, again, any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
b Impairment of assets As explained in Note 2 j, the Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
In making assessments for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are allocated to an appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of those assets, or CGU, is measured at the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets to CGUs, in estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash flows and in selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the value in use calculation.
Subsequent changes to CGU allocation or estimates and assumptions in the value in use calculation could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
c Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs As explained in Note 2 n, provision is made, based on net present values, for decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs as soon as the obligation arises following the development or ongoing production of a mining property.
The provision is based on a closure plan prepared with the assistance of external consultants.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and in the case of capitalised decommissioning costs amortise these estimated costs over the life of the mine.
The ultimate cost of decommissioning and site rehabilitation cost is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites.
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change, for example in response to changes in ore Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 91 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty continued c Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs continued reserves or processing levels.
As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would affect future financial results.
d Post-employment benefits As explained in Note 2 p, the expected costs of severance indemnities relating to employee service during the period are charged to the income statement.
Any actuarial gains or losses, which can arise from differences between expected and actual outcomes or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately within operating costs in the income statement.
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set in consultation with an independent actuary.
These include the selection of the discount rate used, service lives and expected rates of salary increases.
While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would impact the earnings of the Group.
e Deferred taxation As explained in Note 2 m, deferred tax is not provided for future tax payable on undistributed earnings where the Group is able to control the remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance of past profits earned in the foreseeable future.
Management uses its judgement in estimating the probability of such remittances.
These are based on Group forecasts and include assumptions as to future profits and cash flows which depend on several factors including commodity prices, operating costs, production levels, capital expenditures, interest costs, debt repayment and tax rates and cash requirements which may also depend on several factors including future dividend levels.
A change in the assumptions used or in the estimate as to the probability that past profits will be remitted would impact the deferred tax charge and balance sheet provision.
4 Revenue and Total Profit from Operations and Associates An analysis of the Groups total revenue is as follows: 2007 2006 US$m US$m Sales of goods 3,716.0 3,770.7 Rendering of services 110.7 99.3 Group turnover 3,826.7 3,870.0 Other operating income 31.2 10.3 Investment income 113.4 78.3 Total revenue 3,971.3 3,958.6 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 92 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4 Revenue and Total Profit from Operations and Associates continued Operating profit from subsidiaries and joint ventures and total profit from operations and associates is derived from Group turnover by deducting operating cost as follows: 2007 2006 US$m US$m Group turnover 3,826.7 3,870.0 Cost of sales 966.5 805.1 Gross profit 2,860.2 3,064.9 Administrative expenses 183.1 152.6 Closure provision 0.5 0.6 Severance charges 5.3 7.7 Exploration costs 38.1 21.5 Other operating income 31.2 10.3 Other operating expenses 11.0 88.7 Operating profit from subsidiaries and joint ventures 2,653.4 2,804.1 Share of income from associate 1.4 1.1 Total profit from operations and associates 2,654.8 2,805.2 Notes to total profit from operations and associates i In 2007, cost of sales includes an inventory write-off of US$18.8 million relating to high carbonate ore inventories at El Tesoro see Note 19. ii In 2007, other operating income includes a gain of US$10.5 million relating to the disposal of shares held in Mercator Minerals Ltd see Note 18, a gain of US$9.7 million relating to the disposal of the Cordillera fide las Minas joint venture to Panoro Minerals Ltd see Note 17 a, and a gain of US$1.6 million from a settlement in respect of the remaining consideration receivable for the disposal of Minera Tamaya S. A. in 2002.
These items totalled US$21.8 million.
iii In 2006, other operating expenses included losses on commodity derivatives prior to the application of the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 January 2007 see Note 5 a i iii and Note 24 e. 5 Segment Information Based on risks and returns, the Directors consider the primary reporting format is by business segment and the secondary reporting format is by geographical segment.
The Group considers its business segments to be Los Pelambres, El Tesoro, Michilla, Esperanza, Exploration, Railway and other transport services and the Water concession.

Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences with certain limited exceptions.
The Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of profits from Chile and the other countries in which it operates and deferred tax is provided on undistributed earnings to the extent that remittance is probable in the foreseeable future.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 101 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Taxation continued The rate of first category i. e. corporation tax in Chile was 17% for both 2007 and 2006.
Los Pelambres, El Tesoro and Michilla are also subject to a mining tax royalty which imposes an additional tax of 4% of tax-adjusted operating profit.
For 2006 and 2007, 50% of the mining tax could be offset against first category tax and the remaining 50% was tax deductible i. e. an allowable expense in determining liability to first category tax.
From 2008, when the ability to offset will no longer be available, 100% of the mining tax will be tax deductible.
The effect is to increase the effective tax rate of these three operations before taking into account deductibility against corporation tax by approximately 2% in 2006 and 2007 and 4% thereafter.
In addition to first category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of profits from Chile.
Withholding tax is levied on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category tax already paid.
Accordingly, the effective tax rate of withholding tax for the purpose of paying dividends to Group shareholders is approximately 18% of the amount remitted or expected to be remitted.
The effective tax rate for the year was 23.2% in 2007 and 23.3% in 2006, compared with the Chilean statutory tax rate of 17.0%.

A.
The Group had a joint venture agreement, entered into during 2002, with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce Vale of Brazil, with the objective of developing mineral exploration activities in a defined area of interest in southern Peru.
In March 2007 the Group agreed to sell its 50% interest in the joint venture vehicle Cordillera fide Las Minas S. A. CMSA to Panoro Minerals Limited Panoro, a company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
The agreement was subject to a number of conditions including financing by Panoro and regulatory approvals.
These conditions were fulfilled in June 2007 and the disposal was completed at that point.
The fair value of the consideration received, being US$6.0 million in cash plus six million common shares in Panoro, was US$9.7 million.
The joint venture had a nil carrying value in the Groups balance sheet, and accordingly the disposal has resulted in a gain of US$9.7 million being recognised during the year, recorded within other operating income.
b Tethyan Copper Company Limited As explained in Note 30 a, in 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tethyan Copper Company Limited Tethyan for cash consideration including transaction costs of US$170.4 million.
In the same year, the Group subsequently entered into a joint venture agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation Barrick Gold, to establish a 50:50 joint venture in relation to Tethyans mineral interests in Pakistan.
Further details of the part-disposal of Tethyan to Barrick Gold to give effect to the joint venture are set out in Note 31 a.
During 2007 and 2006 Tethyan was wholly engaged in mineral exploration activities and did not generate any revenue in the period before or after acquisition by the Group.
The Groups operating loss resulting from Tethyan for the year was US$34.0 million 2006 US$5.3 million, which relates mainly to exploration costs expensed in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.

The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Other debtors include US$40.2 million 2006 US$28.9 million relating to prepayments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and US$4.7 million 2006 US$12.9 million of Chilean VAT relating to the acquisition of the water concession in 2003.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 109 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents had a maturity period of three months or less from the date of acquisition at both 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006, and carried floating rates of interest.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different from the carrying values presented.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 113 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 24 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management a Categories of financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, grouped according to the categories defined in IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement, were as follows: 2007 2006 US$m US$m Financial assets Financial assets held for trading derivatives not in designated hedge accounting relationships 7.3 Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 1.9 Available for sale investments 3.3 6.2 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents 2,784.9 2,354.9 Financial liabilities Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 1.4 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 515.1 575.0 2,273.6 1,793.4 b Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices: the fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions: and the fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis based on the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
The fair value of each category of financial asset and liability is not materially different from the carrying values presented for either 2007 or 2006. c Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established the Quality and Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Quality and Risk Management Committee.
i Commodity price risk The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes output at prevailing market prices, subject to final pricing adjustments which may be 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market prices for copper and molybdenum both in respect of future Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 114 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued c Financial risk management continued sales and previous sales which remain open as to final pricing.
In 2007, sales of copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes represented 95.2% of Group turnover and therefore revenues and earnings depend significantly on LME and realised copper prices.
The Group uses futures, min-max instruments and options to manage its exposure to copper prices.
These instruments may give rise to accounting volatility due to fluctuations in their fair value prior to the maturity of the instruments.
Details of those copper and molybdenum concentrate sales and copper cathode sales which remain open as to final pricing are given in Note 24 d. Details of commodity rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 24 e. Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the copper price on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date.
A movement in the copper forward price as at the reporting date will affect the final pricing adjustment to sales which remain open at that date, impacting the trade receivables balance and consequently the income statement.
A movement in the copper forward price will also affect the valuation of commodity derivatives, impacting the hedging reserve in equity if the fair value movement relates to an effective designated cash flow hedge, and impacting the income statement if it does not.
The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, remain constant.
If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had increased by 10 cents, net earnings would have increased by US$6.5 million 2006 US$11.6 million and there would have been no additional impact on equity.
If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had decreased by 10 cents, net earnings would have decreased by US$6.5 million 2006 US$10.9 million and there would have been no additional impact on equity.
In addition to the above analysis of the impact of a movement in the forward copper price on the financial instruments held at the reporting date, a movement in the average copper price during the year would impact revenue and earnings.
A one cent change in the average copper price during the year would affect net earnings by US$5.3 million 2006 US$5.9 million and earnings per share by 0.5 cents 2006 0.5 cents, based on production volumes in 2007, without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing and hedging activity.
A one dollar change in the average molybdenum price for the year would affect net earnings by US$10.7 million 2006 US$10.5 million, and earnings per share by 1.1 cents 2006 1.1 cents, based on production volumes in 2007, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing.
ii Currency risk The Group is exposed to a variety of currencies.
The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the majority of the Groups sales are denominated.
Operating costs are influenced by the countries in which the Groups operations are based principally in Chile as well as those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
After the US dollar, the Chilean peso is the most important currency influencing costs and to a lesser extent sales.
Given the significance of the US dollar to the Groups operations, this is the presentational currency of the Group for internal and external reporting.
The US dollar is also the currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of this may be held in other currencies, notably Chilean pesos and sterling, to meet short term operational and capital commitments and dividend payments.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 115 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 24 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued c Financial risk management continued When considered appropriate, the Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group may also use these instruments to reduce currency exposure on future transactions and cash flows.
Details of any exchange rate derivatives entered by the Group in the year are given in Note 24 e. The currency exposure of the Groups cash and cash equivalents is given in Note 21, and the currency exposure of the Groups borrowings is given in Note 22.
The effect of exchange gains and losses included in the income statement is given in Note 6.
Exchange differences on translation of the net assets of entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar the most material of which is Aguas fide Antofagasta S. A. are taken to the currency translation reserve and are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 81.
Currency sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the US dollar Chilean peso exchange rate on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date.
The impact on profit or loss is as a result of the retranslation of monetary financial instruments including cash, trade receivables, trade payables and borrowings.
The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are effective designated cash flow hedges, and changes in the fair value of available for sale equity investments.
The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as interest rates, remain constant.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, net earnings would have decreased by US$3.2 million 2006 US$6.0 million : there would have been no additional impact on equity.
If the US dollar had weakened by 10% against the Chilean Peso as at the reporting date, net earnings would have increased by US$3.9 million 2006 US$7.4 million : there would have been no additional impact on equity.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates.
Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the Groups net finance income or cost, and to a lesser extent on the value of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group occasionally uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage interest rate exposures on a portion of its existing borrowings.
Details of any interest rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 24 e. The interest rate exposure of the Groups cash and cash equivalents is given in Note 21, and the interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings is given in Note 22.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in interest rates in relation to the financial instruments held as at the reporting date.
The impact on profit or loss is as a result of the effect on interest expense in respect of floating rate borrowings, and interest income in respect of cash and cash equivalents.
The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are effective designated cash flow hedges.
If the interest rate increased by 1%, based on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date, net earnings would have increased by US$15.1 million 2006 US$11.2 million.
There would have been no additional impact on equity.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 116 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued c Financial risk management continued iv Other price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on its available for sale equity investments.
Equity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the equity values of the available for sale financial assets held as at the reporting date.
If the value of the available for sale investments had increased by 10% as at the reporting date, equity would have increased by US$0.3 million 2006 US$0.6 million.
There would have been no impact on the income statement.
v Cash flow risk The Groups future cash flows depend on a number of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales levels, operating costs, capital expenditure levels and financial income and costs.
Its cash flows are therefore subject to the exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks described above as well as operational factors and input costs.
Further information on production and sales levels and operating costs are given in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 25. vi Credit risk Credit risk arises from trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily to trade receivables.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and on derivative financial instruments is limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
All customers are subject to credit review procedures, including the use of external credit ratings where available.
Credit is provided only within set limits, which are regularly reviewed.
Outstanding receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for any doubtful receivables.
vii Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and financing facilities, through the review of forecast and actual cash flows.
The Group typically holds surplus cash balances in either demand deposits or short-term deposits, while the majority of borrowings comprise corporate loans at Los Pelambres and El Tesoro which are repayable in semi-annual instalments over three years and one year remaining respectively.
At the end of both 2007 and 2006, the Group was in a net cash position, as disclosed in Note 33 c. Details of cash and cash equivalents are given in Note 21, while details of borrowings including the maturity profile are given in Note 22.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are also given in Note 22.

viii Capital risk management The Groups objective when managing its capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimal capital structure.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22, cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in Note 21 and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 28.
The Group reviews its capital structure on a regular basis.
Based on this, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of ordinary and special dividends, the issue of new shares or repurchase of existing shares, the raising of additional debt or the redemption of existing debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from the prior year.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued d Embedded derivatives provisionally priced sales Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly average molybdenum price for specified future periods.
Under IFRS, both gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open sales are recognised through adjustments to turnover in the income statement and to trade debtors in the balance sheet.
The Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market for that commodity.

e Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
From that date, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows have been recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.

A gain of US$0.7 million was recognised within other finance items, comprising a gain of US$0.2 million at El Tesoro and a gain of US$0.5 million at Michilla, in respect of the time value element of the mark-to-market adjustments, which is excluded from the designated hedging relationship.
A loss of US$0.2 million was recognised within reserves, relating to El Tesoro, in respect of the intrinsic value element of the mark-to-market adjustments, which forms part of the designated effective hedging relationship.
During the year ended 31 December 2006 a loss of US$84.5 million was recognised within other operating expenses, comprising US$44.8 million at El Tesoro and US$39.7 million at Michilla.
This comprised losses on derivatives which matured in the year of US$136.3 million partly offset by mark-to-market gains of US$7.3 million at 31 December 2006 in respect of derivatives maturing after the year end, and the reversal of opening mark-to-market losses of US$44.5 million.

At 31 December 2007, the Group also had futures for 6,500 tonnes, to both buy and sell copper production at El Tesoro, with the effect of swapping COMEX prices for LME prices without eliminating underlying market price exposure, covering a period to 31 January 2009.
The remaining weighted average period covered by these instruments was 7 months.
Between 31 December 2007 and the date of this report, Michilla entered into further min max instruments for 15,000 tonnes of copper production, covering a total period up to 31 December 2008.
The weighted average remaining period covered by these hedges calculated with effect from 1 January 2008 is 6.5 months.

25 Post-Employment Benefit Obligations a Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees.
The amount charged to the income statement in both 2006 and 2007 was less than US$0.1 million, representing the amount paid in the year.
There were no outstanding amounts which remain payable at the end of either year.
b Severance provisions Employment terms at some of the Groups operations provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to an end.
The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the obligation recognised is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated.
The most recent valuation was carried out in 2007 by Ral Benavente, a qualified actuary in Santiago-Chile who is not connected with the Group.
The main assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows: 2007 2006 Average nominal discount rate 5.5% 5.5% Average rate of increase in salaries 2.0% 1.5% Average staff turnover 4.5% 3.9% Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 123 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25 Post-Employment Benefit Obligations continued b Severance provisions continued Amounts included in the income statement in respect of severance provisions are as follows: 2007 2006 US$m US$m Current service cost charge to operating profit 1.8 5.1 Actuarial gains and losses charge to operating profit 3.5 2.6 Interest cost charge to interest expenses 0.7 0.8 Foreign exchange charge credit to other finance items 2.1 0.8 Total charge to income statement 8.1 7.7 Movement in the present value of severance provisions were as follows: 2007 2006 US$m US$m Balance at the beginning of the year 24.1 20.6 Current service cost 1.8 5.1 Actuarial gains and losses 3.5 2.6 Interest cost 0.7 0.8 Paid in the year 3.1 4.2 Foreign currency exchange difference 2.1 0.8 Balance at the end of the year 29.1 24.1 26 Deferred Tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during 2006 and 2007.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of US$55.8 million 2006 US$4.3 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining US$16.3 million 2006 US$17.4 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2007, other deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets were recognised in the balance sheet amounted to US$5.7 million 2006 US$13.9 million.
At 31 December 2006, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was US$2,882.4 million 2006 US$2,184.5 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with the interest in associate are insignificant.

Information relating to the remuneration of key management personnel including the Directors is given in Note 7 c. 38 Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities There are a number of claims currently outstanding to which Antofagasta plc or its subsidiaries the Group is a party, for which no provision has been made in the financial statements and are currently not expected to result in any material loss to the Group.
Details of the principal claims are set out below: a Los Pelambres Mauro tailings dam i In November 2006, the Court of Appeals of Santiago upheld a challenge by claimants in the Pupio Valley against the Chilean Water Authority Direccion General fide Aguas in relation to the award of one of the sectoral permits issued during 2005 for the construction of the Mauro tailings dam by Los Pelambres.
The Court of Appeals has rejected four requests by the claimants that work on the dam should be suspended.
This has enabled Los Pelambres to continue construction pending a final resolution by the Chilean Supreme Court, where Los Pelambres has sought to reverse the November decision as an affected party together with the Direccion General fide Aguas.
The Group believes that Los Pelambres has received all the necessary technical and legal permits and that these have been properly applied for and granted entirely in accordance with the applicable regulations.
It is confident that this view will be upheld by the Chilean Supreme Court.
ii On 19 April 2007 a first instance court in Santiago upheld a claim relating to a purchase agreement entered into in 1992 between two former owners of land in the area of the Mauro tailings dam, in which the validity of that purchase agreement was challenged by the plaintiff seller.
Los Pelambres, which acquired the land in 2001, participated in this trial to protect its interest and has appealed against this decision to the Court of Appeals of Santiago.
The appeal has the effect of suspending the effect of the first instance resolution.
The Group is confident that Los Pelambres legal title to the land in question will be upheld on appeal.
On 18 May 2007 the Court rejected a second petition by the plaintiff in that case that works on the Mauro tailings dam should cease immediately, confirming Los Pelambres right to complete its construction.
The court nevertheless has held that operation of the dam by depositing tailings cannot for the moment commence.
iii On 24 August 2007, a first instance court in Los Vilos notified Los Pelambres of a new claim made by the same individuals involved in other litigation against the Mauro tailings dam.
The claim was filed earlier the same Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 132 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 38 Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities continued a Los Pelambres Mauro tailings dam continued week and Los Pelambres was neither notified of nor represented in the hearing.
The court also notified Los Pelambres of an order to suspend those works which directly affect the Pupio stream.
Los Pelambres believes that it has obtained all the necessary approvals and permits for the construction of the Mauro tailings, which was 98.5% complete at the end of 2007. iv There are other claims at first instance currently in the Chilean courts against governmental authorities.
These claims are not against Los Pelambres, but in some cases the company has intervened in case an eventual judgement affects the project.
Current operations are unaffected as the Quillayes dam which is expected to have capacity until early 2009 remains in use.
b Tethyan Copper Company Limited Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture On 26 June 2007 the High Court of Balochistan at Quetta dismissed a petition which had sought to declare that the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture of 1993 and the exploration licences granted to Tethyan were null and void and overturned an injunction passed earlier by the Court.
The petition had been filed in November 2006 and was directed at several parties including the Group, the Government of Pakistan and the Government of Balochistan.
The petitioners have filed a Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal CPLA against the judgment and this will be heard by the Supreme Court to decide whether the appeal should be heard on its merits.
c Equatorial Mining Limited Errigal In July 2006, Equatorial Mining Limited Equatorial received notice of a claim by Errigal Limited in the New South Wales Supreme Court.
Errigal claims that it is a former minority shareholder in one of Equatorials subsidiaries whose interest was acquired by Equatorial in 1993.
The claim is for amounts payable under the 1993 acquisition agreement.
The Group does not agree with the interpretation of the 1993 agreement advanced by Errigal and the action will continue to be defended vigorously.
