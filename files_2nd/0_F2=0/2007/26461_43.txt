RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates separate fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes.
The assets of the fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Group in a separate trustee administered fund and the funds are primarily managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited, Investec Asset Management Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited.
The Company has no retirement bene t obligations.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME The fide ned bene t scheme is non-contributory and provides bene ts based on final pensionable pay related to salary earned in the last five years of employment.
The fide ned bene t scheme was closed to new members in 1999 but provides retirement bene ts to approximately 20 per cent of current and many former employees.
Pension scheme obligations and costs are determined by an independent quali ed actuary on a regular basis using the projected unit credit method.
The obligations are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme and are re ected in the Group balance sheet.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES The Groups fide ned contribution schemes are now the only schemes open to new employees.
A core contribution of eight per cent of pensionable pay is provided and the Group will match employee contributions up to a maximum of six per cent of pensionable pay.
