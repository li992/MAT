25 Value Added Tax VAT In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether VAT should be charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007, the European Court of Justice ECJ delivered its judgement on the case.
The judgement was favourable to the AIC and the Manager will be able to reclaim from HMRC the VAT charged to the Company from 1 October 2000 in respect of management services and paid to HMRC.
The amount estimated to be realised can be found in note 5 on page 43.
In addition, VAT charged in the period 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996 may also be recoverable from HMRC.
Further VAT may be recoverable from 5 December 1996 to 30 September 2000.
However, at this time the Company is unable to estimate with any certainty whether any benefit will be realisable.
