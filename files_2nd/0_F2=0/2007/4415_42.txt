Notes to the Group financial statements for the financial year ended 31 January 2007 24 Deferred tax Deferred income tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates applicable to the country in which they originate.
Deferred income tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred income tax assets to the extent they are regarded as recoverable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred income tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Due to the change in accounting policy concerning put options held by minorities referred to in note 1, the deferred tax balance brought forward has been restated as shown below.
