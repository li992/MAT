notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 January 31 December.
Assets liabilities held for sale The Group decided in June 2007 to dispose the energy activities in France.
A sales process was initiated which resulted in a divestment of the first part of the activities in September 2007.
The assets and liabilities attributable to the remaining activity, have been classified as held for sale and are presented separately in the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount at the date of the classification as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are not depreciated or amortised from the date when they are reclassified as held for sale.
The proceeds on disposal of the remaining activity are expected to be lower than the net carrying value of the relevant assets and liabilities, and accordingly, an impairment loss on goodwill of DKK 29 million has been recognised at 31 December 2007.
Subsequent to 31 December 2007 the remaining activity has been sold.
