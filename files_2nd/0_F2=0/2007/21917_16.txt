"Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ""IFRS""."
"These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ""IASB"", together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee ""IASC"" that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union."
The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The financial statements are also presented in pounds sterling.
a Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
"Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice ""the SORP"" for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies ""the AIC"" in January 2003 revised in December 2005 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP."
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
No Company Income Statement has been prepared as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. c Presentation of Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Company's status as a UK investment company under Section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Company's compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. d Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where an ex-dividend date is not available, dividends received on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits is accrued to the end of the year.
e Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses have been charged to revenue except as follows: The base management fee of 0.30% has been charged to revenue.
The remainder of the base management fee at the rate of 0.25% or 0.30% if the Company out-performs its benchmark index or under-performs by no more than 5% together with the performance element of the management fee are charged to capital: expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are recognised within the Income Statement as a capital item: expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
f Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
"In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the ""marginal basis""."
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable 34 BEST p22-60 07 P5:BEST p24-54 P2 12 11 07 13:51 Page 35 Annual Report & Accounts 2007 of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
g Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
In accordance with IFRS recognition and measurement principles all the Group's investments are classified as investments designated at fair value through profit or loss and are described in these financial statements as investments held at fair value.
All investments are designated as held at fair value upon initial recognition and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
These may include recent arm's length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost subject to any provision for impairment.
"Investments held by the subsidiary undertaking are classified as ""held for trading"" and are valued at fair value in accordance with the policies above for listed and unlisted holdings."
"Profits or losses on investments ""held for trading"" are taken to revenue."
Foreign exchange gains and losses for fair value through profit or loss on investments are included within the changes in their fair value.
h Movements in fair value Changes in fair value of not held for trading investments are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Income Statement as capital items.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and short-term deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
j Dividends payable Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
k Foreign currency translation Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary items that are fair valued and are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement.

Changes in its fair value are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
On cancellation, realised gains and losses are also recognised through the Income Statement as capital items.
Interest paid on the Index Stock is charged to the Income Statement as a revenue item.
m Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and are recognised through the Income Statement as revenue items.
This does not comply with the Statement of Recommended Practise for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, which would require the finance costs of the Debenture Stocks and the Index Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in the same proportions as the Management Fee.
However, the Directors consider that the treatment adopted, which is consistent with previous years, is the most appropriate given the liquidity of the Company and the nature of the Index Stock.
n Debenture pricing 1 3 The 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 and 10 per cent Debenture Stock 2011 are valued at amortised cost and secured by a floating 8 8 1 charge over all assets of the Company.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance of the 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 have 8 been capitalised and are amortised over the term of the finance.
Further details of the Debenture Stocks are disclosed in notes 13 and 19. o IFRS issued but not yet effective The Group has not adopted the following standards in the preparation of the financial statements as they were not effective at 30 September 2007: IAS1 paragraph 124A-124C Presentation of Financial Statements.

Financial instruments and fund risk profile The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Group's financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
The Group makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
The Group may also enter into derivative transactions which comprise forward foreign exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Group's investing activities and quoted options on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Group has not used derivatives during the current financial year as part of its investment strategy but reserves the right to do so in the future.
The Company, as stated in the Report of the Directors on page 22, conducts its affairs so as to enable it to qualify as an investment trust.
As part of the rules governing this status, no investment at the time of purchase can represent more than 15% by value of the Company's portfolio of investments.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are market price risk which comprises equity price changes, foreign currency exposure, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since 1 October, 2006.
There is no detailed disclosure of credit risk as this is not considered material in the context of the Group's overall activities.
Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to Shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 16 to 18.
Foreign currency risk The Group invests in overseas securities and holds short-term foreign currency cash balances both of which give rise to currency risks.
It is not the Group's usual policy to hedge this risk.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling upon receipt.
Interest rate risk When the Group retains cash balances the majority of the cash is held in deposit accounts.
The interest liability of the Index Stock moves in accordance with movements in the income returns of the FTSE All-Share Index.
This exposure may be reduced by investing in fixed assets expected to perform in line with the FTSE All-Share Index.
Liquidity risk The Group's assets comprise mainly realisable securities.

Contingencies, guarantees and financial commitments In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT, and in early November HM Revenue & Customs decided not to contest that ruling.
The Board had ensured that appropriate steps were taken to reclaim Back VAT and, following the decision by HM Revenue & Customs, will be quantifying those claims and their impact on the management contract with AVI.
It is not possible to estimate the quantum with any accuracy at present but they are unlikely to have a material impact on Net Asset Value.
Accordingly the Directors consider it is inappropriate to recognise any recoverable VAT in these financial statements.
At 30 September 2007 the Group had no contingent liability in respect of any investments carrying an obligation for future subscription or underwriting commitments 2006: nil.
