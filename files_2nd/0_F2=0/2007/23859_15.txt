ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts dated January 2003 and revised in December 2005. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the measurement at fair value of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate on the security.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term loans and deposits are dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Finance costs are accounted for on an effective interest basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves - realised and unrealised.
g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition investments are designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost and subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: Investments listed overseas are valued at bid prices, where the bid price is available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
Transaction costs FRS26 requires that the cost of purchasing investments be recognised and accounted for as a separate item from investment gains.
The Company includes these costs in the cost of investments purchased and has disclosed them in Note 9. h Loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2007 Page 37 Notes to the Financial Statements i Capital reserve realised Gains and losses on the realisation of investments, including listed derivatives, and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised, via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Capital reserve unrealised Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments, including listed derivatives, held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised, via the capital column of the Income Statement.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE Investment management fee 7,265 8,738 Irrecoverable VAT thereon 737 1,223 8,002 9,961 A summary of the terms of the Management Agreement is provided in the Directors Report on pages 20 and 21.
Following the decision of the European Court of Justice in the JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust AIC case C-363 05 which confirmed that the VAT exemption applicable to the management of special investment funds should also extend to investment trust companies, investment trust companies are entitled to recover VAT previously charged on such management fees and HM Revenue and Customs has withdrawn its appeal to the VAT tribunal.
There are uncertainties surrounding the recovery process and therefore no payment has been anticipated in the Companys NAV.
The Company expects to receive a certain amount of VAT paid over past years which is estimated to be in the order of magnitude of around 5 million.
However it is not certain to what extent the full recovery of VAT beyond this amount will be possible.
Discussions are on-going with Fidelity with regard to further recovery and the Company has not sought to estimate or disclose this.
The Company is no longer paying VAT on its management fees.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Management of risk The investment objective of the Company is detailed in the Objective & Highlights on page 1.
In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Euro borrowings to finance operations The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises equity price risk, foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Counterparty credit risk is not significant as transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, all transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Page 44 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through three euro denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loans, which fall due for repayment on 24 November 2008, 22 June 2010 and 15 December 2011.
The Company is exposed, therefore, to a fair value interest risk if euro interest rates change.
In addition the Company has the facility to draw on a revolving credit facility which expires on 15 December 2011.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities, which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Company's borrowing commitments are explained in Notes 11 and 12 to the financial statements.
Financial Assets The Companys financial assets comprise equity investments, short term debtors and cash.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial assets is shown below.
Financial Liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital, reserves and borrowings.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise its euro denominated unsecured loans and other short term creditors.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial liabilities is shown below.
