Following shareholder and Court approval during the year, the other reserve became distributable and has accordingly been transferred to the profit and loss account.
In addition, the Company also reduced the share premium account in existence on 30 June 2007 to nil, and thus has similarly been transferred to the profit and loss account.
The Company considers the share premium account, option reserve and other reserve as non-distributable.
Within the profit and loss account is 66,815,000 of credits in respect of FRS 20 employee share scheme charges in respect of services performed by employees of subsidiary undertakings and recorded as a capital contribution.
