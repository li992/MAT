Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental information The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products produced.
The Group is segmented into two divisions, Foods and Dairies, according to the nature of the products sold and markets serviced.
The Foods segment comprises predominantly branded cheese and spreads sold through major retailers.
It includes both the UK Spreads business and the St Hubert business acquired in January 2007 since both supply similar products to similar markets using the same production and distribution methods.
The Dairies segment comprises predominantly liquid milk sales through major retailers, middle ground or doorstep.
The household business is included within the Dairies segment as its operations are mutually interdependent with the liquid milk business.
Inter-segment sales are not material.
All revenue is derived from the sale of goods.
The Groups geographical segments are based on the location of the Groups assets.
The Group has two geographical segments being UK and Ireland and Rest of world.
The Wexford business, based in Ireland, generates the majority of its revenue from sales into the UK and operates under similar economic and political conditions to the UK.
As a result, the UK and Ireland businesses have been combined into one geographical segment.
Sales to Rest of world disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of customers.
The Rest of world category comprises the St Hubert business and ingredients and finished goods exports from the UK.
They exclude deferred taxation, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives held as hedges of borrowings.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities.
They exclude taxation, retirement benefit obligations, borrowings and related hedges.
This rationalisation includes the closure of certain depots the profit on which is shown above, acquisition of small infill dairy businesses and rationalisation of the ongoing household operations.
These activities represent a fundamental part of the ongoing ordinary activities of the household operations.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits other than in the trades in which they arose and the future profitability of these trades is uncertain.
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of 74.5 million 2006: 72.0 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable gains.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised.
The Group has realised capital gains amounting to 33.6 million 2006: 39.6 million for which rollover relief claims have or are intended to be made.
At 31 March 2007, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2006: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries in Ireland as the Group has determined that retained profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax liability arising from the investments in these subsidiaries, which has not been recognised, is 2.5 million 2006: 2.4 million.
The disposal was announced on 26 September 2006 and at the time of the interim accounts the assets to be disposed were classified as disposal group held for sale and the business was discontinued.
The disposal comprised a sale of assets and therefore the 20% minority interest in Haverfordwest Cheese Limited was purchased prior to disposal.
The post-tax results of this business and the estimated loss on disposal have been disclosed as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement.
The cash flow on disposal can be analysed as follows: Year ended 31 March 2007 m 15555555555555555555555555555555 5555 Proceeds from disposal 67.5 Acquisition of minority interest in Haverfordwest Cheese Limited prior to disposal 5.9 Dividend paid by Haverfordwest Cheese Limited prior to disposal 1.0 Professional fees and other separation costs 2.3 15555555555555555555555555555555 5555 58.3 15555555555555555555555555555555 5555 There were no significant cash flows from operating or financing activities in the period to 14 October 2006 2006: cash flow from operating activities 2.0 million, cash flow from financing nil.
56 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS on profit for the year is calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Basic EPS on continuing operations is calculated on the basis of Group profit for the year from continuing operations less profit attributable to minority interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the directors opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share have been calculated.
There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.

Following the annual review of the carrying value, a further impairment of 7.0 million has been recorded against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment of this business.
We continue to take actions to improve the efficiency and profitability of our speciality cheese business but the Stilton market in particular continues to be challenging.
These market pressures inevitably impact the cash generating capacity of this business and management considers it necessary to recognise an impairment to reflect this.
The carrying value is recorded at fair value since the value in use has been reduced to reflect slower than forecast progress in the recovery plan.
This fair value is based on managements best estimates.
The carrying value of these assets will continue to be reviewed annually although no further impairment is expected.
Further impairments of 0.4 million were crystallised on the disposal of the retailer-branded cheese business.
All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 9.3% 2006: 8% with the exception of St Hubert which is 10.1%.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese excluding speciality cheese is 2.5% pa being the Euro-zone long-term growth rate 2006: 2.5%.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for the Dairies CGU is 0%.
The extrapolated growth rate for Dairies reflects the underlying decline in the doorstep business within the wider Dairies CGU.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to CGUs at 31 March 2007 is: Dairies 64.3 million 2006: 61.5 million UK Spreads 65.5 million 2006: 65.5 million St Hubert 151.3 million 2006: nil Speciality cheese Nil 2006: nil Cheese excluding speciality cheese 2.1 million 2006: 4.1 million The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Gross margin percentages beyond three years are assumed to be constant.
Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group.
This is the benchmark used internally by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date actual prices and forecast price data available.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame.
For the Household business within Dairies, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward.
The directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash-generating unit and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
60 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 12 Goodwill continued Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Dairies CGU, there are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
These are discussed as follows: Future growth rates: Management has assumed no growth after year five in the value in use calculation.
Should any decline in the household business more than offset growth in the liquid products business, resulting in an overall rate of decline beyond year three, value in use for the CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
Gross margins: Management has assumed stable gross margins after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should the margin percentage deteriorate, value in use could be reduced towards a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
External valuers have analysed the intangible assets acquired and identified the St Hubert, Le Fleurier and Valle brands as having values of 127.5 million, 12.7 million and 6.7 million respectively.
On 1 October 2006 the Group acquired a three-year cheese supply contract for a total consideration of 1.4 million.
Customer contracts were acquired with the acquisition of the dairy business and assets of the Midland Co-operative Society in May 2005.
Computer software represents expenditure incurred on a new financials software package implemented across the Group in the year ended 31 March 2006.
The remaining amortisation life for computer software is 3.5 years and for acquired contracts is 13 years.

No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2007 2006: None.
On the acquisition of the Express Dairies depot operations and Liverpool and Nottingham Dairies from Arla Foods UK plc in August 2006, Dairy Crest Limited issued 200,000 non-cumulative irredeemable preference shares to the vendor as part of the consideration.
Each share has a nominal value of 1 and is only redeemable at the option of Dairy Crest Limited for a price of 1 per share.
The preference shares carry a dividend of 7% per annum, payable half-yearly in arrears on 30 June and 31 December.
The amount recorded as a liability above represents the fair value of the contractual dividend stream attached to the preference shares which equates to the full nominal value of those shares.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 65 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two defined benefit pension plans, the Dairy Crest Group pension fund and the Wexford Creamery pension fund, both of which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The Dairy Crest Group pension fund was closed for new employees joining after 1 July 2006.
Employees joining after this date are invited to join a Dairy Crest Group defined contribution plan.
Yoplait Dairy Crest, a 49% owned joint venture, also has a defined benefit pension plan.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004, by the funds independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially and a full valuation is currently being undertaken for 31 March 2007.
The Group has charged nil 2006 0.2 million in respect of a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURB for a director whose benefits are restricted by HMRC limits.
Under this defined contribution scheme, 42.7% of salary was contributed by the Group to his FURB in the year ended 31 March 2006.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the defined benefit plans.
These plans are all wholly or partly funded.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group Statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.
The experience adjustment arising on pension scheme assets in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 21.0 million gain and pension scheme liabilities was 2.3 million loss.
The expected rate of return on equities of 8% reflects historic UK equity returns and is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 5.3% is based upon the gross redemption yield available on a similar profile of gilts and corporate bonds.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, in consultation with the Trustees, action was taken to reduce the allocation of equities and increase the allocation of bonds within overall plan assets.
Included in the above analysis is the Wexford Creamery pension fund.
The net benefit expense in the year ended 31 March 2007 amounted to 0.3 million 2006: 0.3 million.
The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2007 was 8.1 million 2006: 7.1 million and the defined benefit obligation was 9.5 million 2006: 9.4 million resulting in a scheme deficit of 1.4 million 2006: 2.3 million.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 69 Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Share based payment plans Group The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in earnings per share or, from August 2006, economic profit.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years.
On 1 August 2006 542,392 options were granted under the LTISP scheme July 2005: 632,186.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
On 12 December 2005 1,611,689 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave scheme at a grant price of 388 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2007.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Companys shares could be exercised up to 2012 but all outstanding options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2007.
No options have been granted under this scheme since 22 July 2002.
There were no cash settlement alternatives.
At 31 March 2007 no ESOS share options were outstanding options outstanding at 31 March 2006 were exercisable at varying dates up to July 2012 at prices of 189 pence, 341.5 pence and 415 pence.
Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to September 2009 at prices ranging from 368 pence to 388 pence no change from 31 March 2006.
LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to August 2016.
The remaining average weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2007 is 8.29 years for the LTISP, nil years for the ESOS and 2.33 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2006: 8.39 years and 2.67 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 6.27 2006: 4.89, on exercise of ESOS options was 5.45 2006: 4.75 and on exercise of Sharesave options was 6.55 2006: 4.77.
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2005 is 31% giving a fair value of 1.50 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The number of share options granted has been adjusted for leavers in the period to 31 March 2007.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2005 grant were: Expected share price volatility 28%, risk free rate of interest 4.1% and dividend yield 3.5%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2007.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in August 2006 is 68% for the TSR element and 100% for the Economic Profit element July 2005: 65% TSR and 100% EPS giving a fair value of 4.42 per option granted 2006: 3.12.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on economic profit 2006: earnings per share and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
The earnings per share condition, where relevant, is not expected to be satisfied for any of the unvested LTISPs and therefore no charge has been assumed for this element.
There is a reasonable likelihood of the economic profit condition on the 2006 LTISP issue being met and a charge has been assumed for this element.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
70 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 26 Share based payment plans continued The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2007 were as follows: Term 3 years 2006: 3 years Volatility 29% 2006: 28% Risk free rate 4.8% 2006: 4.1% Average volatility of comparator TSR 24% 2006: 22% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 7% 2006: 9% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The weighted average share price at the date of grant was 5.34 for the 2006 grant and 4.83 for the 2005 grant.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2007 is 1.9 million 2006: 1.1 million See Note 10.
Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to September 2009 at a price of 388 pence.
The remaining average weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2007 is 8.18 years for the LTISP and 2.42 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2006: 8.48 years and 1.83 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of Sharesave options was 6.32 2006: 4.77 and on the exercise of ESOS options was 6.39 2006: none exercised.
The Company expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2007 was 0.4 million 2006: 0.2 million.

72 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 29 Business combinations On 16 January 2007 the Group acquired the entire share capital of St Hubert SAS, a branded French spreads company and its 100% owned subsidiary Uniq Foods Italia Srl for a consideration of 250.2 million net of cash on acquisition of 2.1 million.
The provisional fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the business at the date of acquisition was: Fair value Book to Group value m m 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Property, plant and equipment 4.8 4.8 Intangible assets 146.9 Deferred tax 47.5 1.4 Inventories 5.0 5.0 Receivables 10.8 10.8 Cash 2.1 2.1 Payables 19.2 19.2 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Net assets 102.9 4.9 5555 Goodwill 149.4 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 Consideration 252.3 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 Comprising: Cash consideration Eur 370.4 million 248.5 Professional fees 3.8 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 Provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities of St Hubert SAS have been used in order to calculate goodwill due to the proximity of the acquisition to 31 March 2007.
Final valuation will take place during the period to 15 January 2008.
Fair value adjustments comprise the recognition of brands as intangible assets see Note 13 and the related deferred tax liability.
From the date of acquisition, St Hubert contributed 1.3 million to Group profit for the year.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006, the Group profit for the year would have been 53.7 million and revenue from continuing operations would have been 1,359 million.
Included in the 149.4 million of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include an assembled workforce, technology, licence agreements and customer relationships.
On 19 August 2006, the Group acquired the business and assets of the Express Dairies depot operations and the Liverpool and Nottingham dairies from Arla Foods UK plc for a total consideration of 41.3 million including working capital.
The provisional fair value of the assets acquired and the resulting goodwill can be analysed as follows: Fair value Book to Group value m m 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Property, plant and equipment 31.9 25.8 Inventories 2.7 2.5 Receivables 21.9 21.9 Payables 17.3 18.0 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Net assets 39.2 32.2 5555 Goodwill 2.1 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 Consideration 41.3 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 Comprising: Cash consideration 38.9 Issue of preference shares 0.2 Fees 2.2 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 The trade and assets of the depot and dairies acquired from Arla Foods UK plc were absorbed into the wider Household business within Dairy Crest Limited.
As a result, disclosure of the profit for the year to 31 March 2007 is impracticable.
Similarly, it is impracticable to disclose what Group profit and revenue from continuing operations would have been if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006.
Fair value adjustments comprise an upward revaluation of land and buildings based on external valuations 6.3 million, a reclassification between property, plant and equipment and inventories 0.2 million and an adjustment to accruals 0.7 million.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled milk buyers for cash consideration of 0.7 million resulting in goodwill of 0.7 million after accounting for the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired of nil book value nil.
During the year, the Group acquired cheese supply contracts for a consideration of 1.4 million, of which 0.3 million was deferred.
No goodwill was recognised on this acquisition see Note 13.
Included in goodwill for Express Dairies and the smaller bottled milk buyers are certain intangible assets that cannot be separably identified and measured due to their nature.
These include acquired milk round lists and assembled workforces.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
The majority of the value was assessed to comprise synergy benefits expected to be achieved by merging the business acquired into the Groups existing operations.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 73 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Business combinations continued During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group acquired: The entire share capital of Starcross Foods Limited, a dairy in Foston, Derbyshire, for a consideration of 17.0 million including debt on acquisition of 9.1 million.

30 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that forecast net debt, plus a reasonable operating headroom, are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
At 31 March 2007 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 638 million 2006: 405 million excluding finance leases of 17 million 2006: 18 million.
The facilities consist of: a term loan of 45 million repayable in three semi-annual instalments from December 2007 to December 2008 2006: 80.0 million, repayable from December 2007 to June 2009 : a 250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in June 2009 2006: 270 million : a 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011 2006: nil : a 100 million 364 day multi-currency revolving credit facility with term out option repayable in November 2007 this was repaid on 5 April 2007 with the proceeds from an additional loan note issue of 150 million see Note 34 2006: nil : and Loan notes totalling 143 million after the impact of cross-currency swaps repayable in April 2013 61.7 million and April 2016 81.3 million 2006: nil.
Undrawn facilities at 31 March 2007 amounted to 180.6 million 2006: 128.3 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts, specifically to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 31 March 2007, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps and excluding finance leases, approximately 44% of the Groups net debt was at a fixed rate of interest 2006: 40%.
Note that after the issue of 110 million fixed rate loan notes on 4 April 2007, approximately 70% of the Groups net debt is at a fixed rate of interest.
Foreign currency risk Transaction exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of our overseas subsidiaries St Hubert SAS and Wexford Creamery Limited.
Our policy is to hedge between 80% and 120% of the net asset exposure through borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
No hedging of earnings exposure is undertaken.
At present, our only translation exposure is in Euros.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter, Stilton and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed.
In addition, a substantial part of Yoplait Dairy Crests purchases are denominated in Euros, which are hedged for at least 1 year in advance by foreign exchange contracts.
There are currently no sales between the UK business and St Hubert SAS.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
74 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Commodity risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability.
In certain circumstances, forward contracts have been put in place in order to fix future prices, principally for gas and electricity.
These contracts are only entered into with the approval of the executive directors.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant in the context of the Group.
The household business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 175.8 million 2006: 149.6 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be low.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2007 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial instruments continued The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity of the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.

Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2007 was 50 million 2006: 100 million.
Interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next 5 years being the life of the swap.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2007 was $233 million and relate to the $US loan notes issued on 4 April 2006 2006: nil.

The gain deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next 7 to 10 years being the life of the swaps.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of i the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its subsidiary in France ii the net asset investment in Wexford Creamery Limited, its subsidiary in Ireland.
The fair value of the euro borrowings at 31 March 2007 was 265.6 million 2006: 15.3 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 2.7 million 2006: nil on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in reserves.
Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2007 of 180.6 million 2006: 128.3 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These undrawn facilities expire in June 2009.
On 5 April 2007, 100 million of revolving credit facilities were repaid and cancelled.
These facilities were replaced by loan notes of 150 million and 10 million issued on 4 April 2007 maturing 4 April 2014 and 4 April 2017.

Other receivables comprise intercompany balances with Dairy Crest Limited.
All intercompany balances are repayable on demand and those on which interest is receivable payable include: an intercompany loan to Dairy Crest Limited of 150.6 million 2006: nil on which interest is receivable at 5.3%: an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of 42.2 million 2006: 39.9 million on which interest is payable at LIBOR 100 basis points 2006: LIBOR 100 basis points.
A convertible loan was issued by Dairy Crest Limited to Dairy Crest Group plc on 15 January 2007.
The loan had a principal value of 236.0 million with a coupon of 0.1% per annum.
On 31 March 2009 it will either be repaid in full by Dairy Crest Limited or convert into 57.8 million ordinary shares in Dairy Crest Limited and 23.6 million of loan notes paying LIBOR plus margin maturing 29 March 2019.
The convertible has been designated as at fair value through profit and loss having satisfied the conditions in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
Since the loan is neither an equity investment nor currently convertible, it is within the scope of IAS 39.
In addition, as described above, the convertible loan contains a derivative, namely a call option to acquire an equity interest in Dairy Crest Limited which meets the requirements in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
The convertible loan is carried at fair value with any gains or losses taken to the income statement.
At 31 March 2007 an external valuation was undertaken resulting in a gain on the convertible loan of 4.0 million.
The convertible loan is not traded in a publicly quoted market therefore a Black Scholes Option Pricing model was used in order to value the equity portion of the loan.
The input assumptions used were as follows: dividend yield 2.6%, volatility 21%, risk free rate 5.4%, time to expiry 2 years.
Dairy Crest Limited is the principal UK Group trading company and therefore the exposure to credit risk on the convertible loan is nil.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2007 was 50 million 2006: nil.
Cross currency swaps External The notional principal amount of the outstanding cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2007 was $233 million and relate to the $US loan notes issued on 4 April 2006 2006: nil.
Intercompany The notional principal amount of the outstanding cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2007 with Dairy Crest Limited was 351.8 million 2006: nil.
The Company will receive 351.8 million and pay 236 million on 15 January 2008.
Intercompany cross currency swaps have not been designated as cash flow hedges and any gain or loss arising on revaluation is credited or charged to the income statement.
The gain recorded in the year ended 31 March 2007 was 2.6 million 2006: nil.
Borrowing facilities The Company has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2007 of 180.6 million 2006: 128.3 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.

Under IFRS, Dollar long-term borrowings are retranslated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
The cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value Note 31 and incorporate movements in both market exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group defines net debt so as to include the effective Sterling liability where cross-currency swaps have been used to convert foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.
The 14.3 million adjustment included above converts the Sterling equivalent of Dollar loan notes from year end exchange rates 118.7 million to the fixed Sterling liability 133.0 million.
This amount forms part of the overall swap fair value of 7.9 million 2006: nil shown in Note 31.
The loan notes mature in two tranches of 7 and 10 years.
The effective interest rate on the combined issue is 4.9%.
On completion of this transaction and subsequent repayment of certain revolving credit facilities of 100 million, Group long-term borrowing facilities, including finance leases, total 667 million.
On 14 May 2007 the Group announced that it was considering the potential closure of its Totnes site subject to a 90-day employee consultation process.
Should this process result in closure of the site in the second half of the year, exceptional costs of around 6 million are anticipated.
Approximately 3 million of these costs would relate to the write-down of property, plant and equipment.
Their carrying value at 31 March 2007 was supported by their underlying value in use and therefore no impairment was recognised at that date.
35 Corporate information The consolidated accounts of Dairy Crest Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2007 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 21 May 2007 and the consolidated and Company balance sheets were signed on the boards behalf by Mr A S N Murray and Mr M Allen.
