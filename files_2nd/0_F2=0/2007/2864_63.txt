Although the Company had sufficient reserves to make these purchases at each transaction date, interim accounts as defined in the Companies Act 1985 showing the requisite level of distributable profits had inadvertently not been filed with the Registrar of Companies, as required by the Companies Act 1985.
As a result of this technical infringement, the repurchase and cancellation of 36.8m shares, equating to 175.4m was invalid.
This situation was rectified during the year with no net impact on share capital, capital redemption reserve and retained earnings.
