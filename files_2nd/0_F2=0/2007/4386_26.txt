The diluted earnings per share of 70.49p 2006: 47.59p is calculated on the diluted profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent of 64,661,000 2006: 41,235,000 being the profit for the year of 62,093,000 2006: 41,235,000 plus the convertible bond interest net of tax of 2,568,000 2006: Nil divided by 91,726,521 dilutive potential ordinary shares 2006: 86,649,511, calculated as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Basic weighted average number of shares 86,037 85,481 Dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share Option schemes 1,754 1,169 Convertible bonds 3,936 91,727 86,650 There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements which require to be disclosed.
11. iNtANgiBLE AssEts The movements during the year were as follows: Exploration and Evaluation Goodwill Assets Total 000 000 000 Cost and Net Book Value: At 1 January 2006 106,797 106,797 Additions 21,676 21,676 Transfers and reclassifications 31,391 31,391 At 31 December 2006 97,082 97,082 Arising on acquisition 145,773 20,355 166,128 Exchange adjustments 8,484 1,166 9,650 Additions 69,760 69,760 Unsuccessful exploration and evaluation 12,691 12,691 Disposals 3,275 3,275 At 31 December 2007 154,257 172,397 326,654 Exploration and Evaluation Additions to exploration and evaluation assets represent the ongoing execution of the underlying work programmes and the fulfillment of individual licence requirements.
During the year, following completion of geotechnical evaluation activity, certain licences were relinquished, and wells declared unsuccessful.
Accordingly the related licence expenditures were expensed.
During 2007, the principal exploration write-offs were Mauritania Block 8, Kenya L5, Clachnaben in the UK.
The GAB acreage in Australia was also relinquished.
Disposals represent costs incurred on Causeway licence sold during the year.
The remaining net book value of exploration and evaluation assets at 31 December 2007 represents ongoing evaluation work in progress.
74 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2007 Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is described more fully in note 29 Acquisition of Subsidiaries, on pages 90 to 92.
The Group has one class of business, the exploration for and production of hydrocarbons liquids and gas: and has determined that this primary business segment will be used, for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations on an annual basis.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The recoverable amount of the primary business segment is determined by value in use calculations which measure the net present value at the reporting date of the anticipated cash flow projections from each individual asset which comprise the portfolio underpinning the business segment.
Life of field cash flow projections are used for development and producing assets, applying generally accepted market assumptions for commodity price and future inflation.
The cash flows are then discounted at 8%.
For exploration assets a risked valuation is used which combines an assessment of the expected chance of commercial success, and likely development cost.
The calculation of value in use for the segment is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Commodity price Production Operating costs Capital costs Value attributable to exploration Commodity prices reflect the Boards estimate of the future prices.
For the 2007 acquisitions, the budgeted prices were used which were $60 boe and 35p therm for oil and gas respectively.
Production profiles are estimated for each individual asset within the Group Development and Production portfolio by the technical management team.
Operating Costs and Capital Costs are estimated using information from either the Operator for non-operated assets or by the technical management team for operated assets.
A rate of 2.5% is used as an annual inflation factor.
Value attributable to exploration from the Groups extensive exploration portfolio, is derived from two sources: one, being the market value of existing discoveries which have established the presence of hydrocarbons, but where further appraisal activity is required, and the other, being the economic monetary value of the future drilling portfolio taking account of geological risking less the expected post-tax exploration cost: in both cases, using valuation multiples in line with precedent transactions.
The Board considers the value attributable to exploration to be significantly ahead of the current carrying value but on the basis of current calculations, this does not require to be invoked for the Goodwill impairment review.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions There are possible changes to the other key assumptions above which might be considered reasonably likely and cause the carrying value of the segment to exceed its recoverable amount.
Commodity price the Board has considered the possibility of lower than planned oil and gas prices.
A reduction in oil price to $43 per barrel would result in the value in use being reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount assuming no incremental exploration value.
Production the Board recognise that production profiles may be adjusted at each future reserve estimate review.
An across-the-board reduction of 19.53% in production accompanied by an oil price of $60 per barrel would result in value in use being reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount, again assuming no incremental exploration value.
The Board considers that the market capitalisation of the Company is a good indicator of the recoverable amount of the business segment including exploration value.
At 31 December 2007 the market capitalisation was 595,467,000 greater than the segment carrying amount.
