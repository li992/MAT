The CGUs have been defined as the operating business to which the goodwill relates.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2007 2006 m m Solway Foods 30.1 30.1 Fletchers 17.2 Green Isle 14.9 15.2 Park Cakes 2.9 45.0 65.4 The disposals of goodwill relate to the sale of the Assets on 13 January 2007.
For further details see note 11.
The group tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using the groups weighted average cost of capital.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate used is not more than 3.0% 2005 06: not more than 3.0% and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the groups post tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% 2005 06: 7.0%.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.

The carrying amount of the groups leasehold property includes an amount of nil 2005 06: 0.9m in respect of assets held under finance leases.
Impairment Discontinued operations A net 5.0m impairment charge was incurred during the period relating to discontinued operations.
As part of its business review, management identified impairment losses of 10.0m relating to the closure of the Trafford Park Bakery.
This impairment was partly offset by a 5.0m reduction in a previous impairment of other operations within the chilled Pastry category.
The impaired assets have been sold during the period as part of the sale of the Assets therefore the impairment has been included within discontinued operations.
The impairment losses identified represent the difference between the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations unless management is committed to closing or selling the business.
If the value of the business is to be recovered through sale or closure then the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell.

The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
The directors consider the maximum credit risk at the balance sheet date is equivalent to the carrying value of trade and other receivables.
21 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
22 Credit risk The groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trading investments.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful trade receivables, estimated by the groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The groups top five customers, all leading UK retailers, represent more than 75% of the groups revenue.
These customers have favourable credit ratings and consequently reduce the credit risk for the groups overall trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The amount written off in respect of credit risk was 0.3m 2005 06: 0.1m.

The carrying amounts of short term borrowings and the revolving credit facility 2010 approximate to fair value.
The fair value of the Senior loan notes 2012-2017 is disclosed below: 2007 2007 2006 2006 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value mm mm Senior loan notes 2012-2017 132.6 132.0 142.9 142.9 At the period end the group had available 375.0m 2005 06: 190.0m of undrawn committed facilities on the revolving credit facility 2010 and 14.6m bank overdrafts 2005 06: 18.8m, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Currency exposure The group operates primarily in the UK with a functional currency of sterling.
The functional currency of the overseas companies is euros, giving rise to foreign currency exposure.
The average and closing rates used in the accounts to translate euros to sterling were 1.464 1 and 1.474 1 respectively 2005 06: 1.466 1 and 1.433 1 respectively.
26 Financing Bank overdrafts All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured and repayable on demand, and are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest rate on bank overdrafts is 1.0% 2005 06: 1.0% above the Bank of England base rate.
Revolving credit facility 2010 The group holds a five year syndicated revolving credit facility of 460.0m.
At the period end, the amounts due under the facility were 85.0m 2005 06: 270.0m.
The amount drawn down is repayable in periods of up to one year but is capable of being immediately refinanced as part of the committed revolving credit facility 2010.
The rate of interest fluctuates in line with market rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Senior loan notes 2012-2017 The company has approximately 142.7m of senior guaranteed loan notes in the US Private Placement debt market.
Notes are in both US dollars USD $155.0m and pounds sterling 54.3m.
The notes are fixed rate and unsecured.
Part of the Senior loan notes 2012-2017 will be repayable at face value during 2007 08 to the extent that a proportion of the proceeds from the business disposals have not been reinvested in acquisitions or capital investment.
The maturity profile of the Senior loan notes 2012-2017 is as follows: Tranche Maturity Amount m Rate Series A December 2012 $35.0 5.63% Series B December 2015 $82.5 5.77% Series C December 2017 $37.5 5.87% Series D December 2012 28.5 5.47% Series E December 2015 25.8 5.47% All US dollar cash flows are hedged using cross currency swaps.
Northern Foods will receive each 20 December and 20 June the bond interest payment dates fixed USD sufficient to fully cover interest due to holders of the USD denominated bonds, in exchange for payment of fixed pounds sterling on the same date.
The weighted average interest rate payable in pounds sterling by the company is approximately 5.5%.
Additionally, the swap contracts provide for an exchange of the principal amounts at maturity at the same rate of exchange as the initial principal was translated 1 US$1.752.
Loan notes The loan notes were all redeemed during the period 2005 06: 0.2m.
The loan notes bore interest at 1.0% below the base rate, and could be redeemed at amounts of 20,000 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount half yearly on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed would have been redeemed at their nominal amount on 30 June 2008.
74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc 27 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency interest rate swaps The company has cross currency interest rate swaps to provide a cash flow hedge against currency and interest rate movements on the US$155.0m loan notes.
Swap contracts with nominal value of US$155.0m 88.5m have fixed sterling interest payments at an average rate of 5.5% for periods up to 2017 and have fixed USD interest receipts at an average rate of 5.76%.
As at the period end, swaps had a negative fair value of 6.5m 2005 06: 1.6m.
Other currency derivatives From time to time the group has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exchange rate exposure.
The instruments purchased are denominated in euros.
The total notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the group has committed is nil 2005 06: nil.
The fair value of the groups currency derivatives is estimated to be approximately nil 2005 06: nil.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to nil have been charged to the income statement in the year 2005 06: nil.
28 Analysis of net debt References to net debt refer to the total borrowings of the group, including both short term and long term bank loans, bonds, loan notes and finance leases, after offsetting the cash and cash equivalents of the business and short term investments.
Net debt will also include the proportion of the fair value of the currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the groups dollar denominated loan notes.
The table below reconciles net debt to the corresponding balance sheet captions: 2007 2006 m m Cash and cash equivalents 48.3 40.7 Trading investments 4.9 9.6 Bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes due within one year 0.4 1.4 Revolving credit facility 2010 85.0 270.0 Senior loan notes 2012-2017 132.6 142.9 Currency element of fair value of swaps hedging the groups dollar denominated loan notes 9.4 0.9 Net debt 174.2 363.1 Net debt Net debt is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled non-IFRS debt measures reported by other companies.
The group adopts this measure because it is used in calculating the banking covenants.
It is also the measure used for internal debt analysis.
In addition, the net debt balance provides an indication of the net borrowings on which the company is required to pay interest.

No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of losses of 4.0m incurred by Northern Foods Insurance Limited relating to the fire in the Speciality bread category.
The losses will be carried forward for future offset but it is unclear as to when the asset will be realised.

78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc 35 Share based payments continued Performance conditions notes A No performance condition attached.
B Performance condition measured by reference to total shareholder return TSR.
The company met the performance condition by finishing above the median point against the comparator group of companies.
C Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The target requires that the real growth in earnings per share over the three year performance period is greater than 3% per annum compound.
The performance condition allows for retesting after years four and five against the full period from the grant.
D Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The performance condition does not allow for retesting.
E The LTIP has two performance conditions: TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on how the TSR in relation to an ordinary share of Northern Foods over the relevant performance period compares with TSR in relation to the ordinary shares of the companies in the comparator group in the same period.
Where the TSR of Northern Foods over the performance period places it between the median and the upper quartile, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight line basis with 20% of the shares being received when Northern Foods is placed above median, and 50% being received where Northern Foods is placed in the upper quartile.
Where Northern Foods growth in TSR places it below median, no shares will vest in relation to this element of the award.
Return on invested capital ROIC : 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
Growth in ROIC over the period has to be 100 or more basis points.
The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a straight line basis with 7.5% of the shares being received if Northern Foods achieves growth of 100 basis points and maximum of 50% being received if the company achieves growth of 200 basis points.
F Under the Share bonus plan, 80% of annual bonus opportunity is linked to specific financial targets.
The other 20% is directly related to individual performance against personal performance contracts set at the start of the financial year, which contain six individual and business performance targets which are considered appropriately stretching.
G The Deferred share bonus plan DSBP was introduced in June 2006 so as to incentivise and retain the key talent necessary to drive the specific performance improvements required.
This DSBP provided approximately 40 senior executives with an award of shares with a value up to 100% of base salary, at the prevailing market price of 81.75 pence per share on the date of award.
These shares will be satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held in trust after the vesting date in July 2009.

Northern Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees, principally the Northern Foods Pension Scheme the Scheme and Northern Foods Pension Builder Pension Builder in the United Kingdom and the Green Isle Foods Group Retirement and Death Benefit Plan the Plan in the Republic of Ireland.
Under the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on pay and service.
The Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are funded schemes whilst there is a post retirement medical scheme which is unfunded.
The Scheme and the Plan are final salary schemes.
The assets of the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the group.
On 22 March 2005 the company announced the closure of the Scheme to new entrants and withdrew its agreement to allow early retirement on an enhanced basis.
Pension Builder was introduced on 1 May 2005 and is available to all UK based employees.
Pension Builder is a defined benefit scheme based on the career average principle.
The most recent valuation of the Scheme for the purpose of the financial statements and the present value of defined benefit obligations was carried out at 31 March 2007 by an independent qualified actuary,  LLP.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost was measured using the Projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and Pension Builder are detailed below.
Valuation date 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 3.7% Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.9% 2.7% Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.0% 3.0% Discount rate 5.3% 4.9% Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.8% Sensitivities The mortality assumptions used are based on mortality experience of the Scheme and anticipated mortality experience.
The assumptions are below the national average reflecting the socio-economic make up of the Scheme membership.
For the valuation at 31 March 2007, the company has adopted the short cohort principle for the Scheme and Pension Builder.
If life expectancy is increased or decreased by one year, liabilities are estimated to increase or decrease by 20.0m respectively.
The impact of a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase liabilities by 15.0m respectively.
The life expectancy in years for a member aged 65 are as follows: Valuation date 2007 2006 Years Years Current pensioner male 17.7 16.6 female 19.8 18.7 Future pensioner male 18.4 17.5 female 20.5 19.7 Post retirement medical benefit scheme Until 31 March 1999, the group operated a post retirement medical benefit scheme.
The method of accounting, assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes detailed above.
The main actuarial assumptions are the underlying medical cost inflation of 5.0% per annum 2005 06: 5.0% and the discount rate of 5.3% per annum 2005 06: 4.9%.
If the assumed rate of underlying medical cost inflation increased or decreased by 1.0% per annum then the valuation of the liabilities is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately 0.4m 2005 06: 0.5m respectively.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the groups defined benefit schemes and post retirement medical benefit scheme are as follows: Post retirement Total retirement Defined benefit schemes medical benefit scheme benefit schemes 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m m m Current service cost 18.6 18.7 18.6 18.7 Past service cost 0.1 0.1 Interest on obligation 39.7 39.3 0.2 0.3 39.9 39.6 Expected return on scheme assets 52.4 42.4 52.4 42.4 6.0 15.6 0.2 0.3 6.2 15.9 Curtailment gain due to business disposals 21.1 21.1 15.1 15.6 0.2 0.3 14.9 15.9 included within restructuring items The charge for the period has been included within cost of sales, distribution costs and administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
80 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc 36 Retirement benefit obligations continued Impact of business disposals on the Scheme During the period a curtailment gain of 2.1m arose on the sale of the trade and assets of NFT Distribution and a gain of 19.0m arose on the disposal of the trade and assets of the Speciality bread, chilled Pastry, Cakes and Flour milling businesses.
The curtailment gains have been included in the profit or loss on disposal of the businesses.
A curtailment gain reflects reduced liabilities of the Scheme due to removing the salary link when formerly active members of the Scheme become deferred members.
Further information on the disposal of these businesses is disclosed in note 11.
As a result of the disposal programme announced in May 2006, special pension contributions of 57.0m will be made to the Scheme.
As at 31 March 2007 special contributions of 35.0m had been made with the remaining 22.0m to be paid in June 2007.
