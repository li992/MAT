Total capital employed is managed on a basis that enables the Group to continue trading as a going concern, while delivering acceptable returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Additionally, the Group is also committed to reducing its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the future level of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase shares from shareholders, issue new equity instruments or dispose of assets to reduce its net debt exposure.
The Group reviews its total capital employed on a regular basis and makes use of several indicative ratios which are appropriate to the nature of the Groups operations and are consistent with conventional industry measures.
The principal ratios used in this review process are: gearing, defined as net debt divided by total capital employed: and return on capital employed, defined as underlying operating profit, plus share of associates net earnings, before special items, divided by average capital employed.
The Group operates a DLC structure which has been agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance and is subject to certain exchange control conditions.
The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to manage its capital structure optimally.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, is constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
