Notes to the financial statements 24 Derivative financial instruments continued Embedded derivatives Certain long-term software licensing contracts are priced in currencies usually US dollars, pounds sterling or euros other than those of the functional currencies of the entities entering into the contracts.
Under IAS 39, such contracts may contain an embedded foreign currency derivative which must be extracted from the host contract and measured separately at each balance sheet date.
Gains or losses on these derivatives are charged or credited to the income statement.
The contracts are generally of up to 10 years duration, and this is therefore the period over which the assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet are expected to crystallise.
