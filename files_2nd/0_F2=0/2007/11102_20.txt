Accounting Policies B Ba as siis s o of f p pr re ep pa ar ra at tiio on n The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share based payment liabilities which are measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million pounds except where otherwise indicated.
B Ba as siis s o of f c co on ns so olliid da at tiio on n The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The results and net assets of associated undertakings are incorporated into these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
G Go oo od dw wiillll Goodwill arising on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually: any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
P Pr ro op pe er rt ty y, p plla an nt t & & e eq qu uiip pm me en nt t Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment to their estimated residual values, based on current prices at the balance sheet date, over their remaining useful lives by equal annual instalments.
The depreciation rates generally applicable are summarised as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2.0% Plant, shop fronts and retail fittings in the high street retailing business 16.7%-50.0% All other plant, fixtures, fittings, IT assets and vehicles 6.67%-50.0% Leasehold improvements over the period of the lease, or useful life if shorter IIn nv five es st tm me en nt ts s Investments in subsidiary companies and equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment.
4 42 2 Accounting Policies IIm mp pa aiir rm me en nt t The carrying values of assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
IIn nv five en nt to or riie es s Stock is valued at the lower of standard cost or net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
T Tr ra ad fide e a an nd d o ot th he er r r re ec ce eiiv va ab blle es s Trade receivables are stated at original invoice amount plus any accrued service charge in the case of Directory customer receivables.
Where there is objective evidence that there is an impairment loss, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
S Sh ha ar re e b ba as se ed d p pa ay ym me en nt ts s The fair value of employee share options granted on or after 7 November 2002 is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
The resulting cost is charged in the income statement over the vesting period of the option, and is adjusted for the expected and actual number of options vesting.
For cash-settled share based payments including the long term incentive plan, the fair value of the liability is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised through the income statement over the period in which the related services are received by the Group.
T Ta ax xa at tiio on n Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of taxation that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted.
Taxation is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity: otherwise it is recognised in the income statement.
C Ca as sh h a an nd d c ca as sh h e eq qu uiiv va alle en nt ts s Cash and short term deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
4 43 3 Accounting Policies For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term deposits, less bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand.
B Ba an nk k llo oa an ns s a an nd d o ov five er rd dr ra af ft ts s Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
R Re ev five en nu ue e Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided to customers outside of the Group, stated net of returns and value added and other sales taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income, including Directory service charge, is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the applicable effective interest rate.
Income from rendering of services is recognised when the services have been performed.
Royalty income is recognised in line with sales reported by the Groups franchise partners.
F Fo or re eiig gn n c cu ur rr re en nc ciie es s The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of foreign operations are translated at the weighted average rate during the period.
Differences on translation are recognised as a separate equity reserve which was deemed to be zero on transition to IFRS at 1 February 2004.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences for that subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
F Fiin na an nc ciia all iin ns st tr ru um me en nt ts s Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of overseas sourced products, and changes in interest rates relating to the Groups debt.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are stated at their fair value.
The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their quoted market value at the balance sheet date.
Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration of the derivative instrument together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into account prevailing interest rates.
Hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the asset or liability for the hedged transaction is recognised in the balance sheet, the associated gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.
Gains or losses realised on cash flow hedges are then recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
4 44 4 Accounting Policies The Group uses interest rate derivatives as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys 2013 corporate bond.
The carrying amount of the bond is adjusted only for changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk and this value adjustment is recognised in the income statement.
Any gain or loss from restating the related interest rate derivatives at their market value is also recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Contingent purchase contracts The Group also makes use of contingent contracts for the purchase of its own shares.
These derivative contracts are accounted for as equity transactions and the contracts are not stated at their market values.
The present value of the obligation to purchase the shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that obligation is conditional.
Any subsequent reduction in the total obligation arising from the early termination of a contract is credited back to equity at the time of termination.
S Sh ha ar re es s h he elld d b by y E ES SO OT T The NEXT Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.
E Em mp pllo oy ye ee e b be en ne ef fiit ts s The Group operates a pension plan which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The assets of the plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Group also provides other, unfunded, post-employment benefits to certain plan members.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit section and the unfunded arrangement are determined separately using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The net retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit section and unfunded liabilities as reduced by the fair value of defined benefit plan assets.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, are recognised directly in equity and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other income and expenses associated with the defined benefit section are recognised in the income statement.
The pension cost of the defined contribution section is charged in the income statement as incurred.
P Pr ro ov viis siio on ns s A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
L Le ea as siin ng g c co om mm miit tm me en nt ts s Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in fixed assets and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors.
The assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
4 45 5 Accounting Policies Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Contingent rentals payable based on store revenues are accrued in line with the related sales.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and capital contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are released to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
N Ne ew w a ac cc co ou un nt tiin ng g s st ta an nd da ar rd ds s The Group has not adopted early the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which will both become mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
The new disclosures will therefore be adopted in the Groups financial statements from the year ending January 2008.
The Group has not adopted early the disclosure requirements of IAS 8 Operating Segments which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will therefore be adopted in the Groups financial statements from the year ending January 2010.
