Excluding 999 year leases, the average loan term for these properties is 50 years and the average borrowing rate has been determined at the inception of the lease to be 8.9%.
In addition the Group leases certain fixtures and equipment under finance leases, the obligations for which are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The average lease term is 3-4 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the average implicit borrowing rate was 14.9% 2006: 14.6%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All lease obligations, which are denominated in Sterling, are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.

BORROWINGS continued f Interest The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2007 2006 % % Unsecured senior notes 5.8 5.8 Bank loans and overdrafts 6.4 5.7 Other borrowings 5.6 5.0 Bank term loans and revolving credit facilities of 883.6m 2006: 970m were arranged at variable interest rates.
The $400m unsecured senior notes were issued at fixed rates of interest and swapped into variable rates.
This exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
As detailed in note 25, to manage the risk the Group entered into interest rate derivatives arrangements, which for 2007, fixed interest rates on 278m of borrowing.
For the year to 31 December 2007 this had the effect of reducing the weighted average interest rates paid by 0.5%.
In respect of income earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.

There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 25. h Guarantees and security No debt is secured, except for that relating to 1.2m 2006: 1.9m of finance lease obligations, which are secured on the assets subject to the leases.
