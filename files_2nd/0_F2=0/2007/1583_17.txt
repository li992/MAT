10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Company where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the functional currency against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
The movements above arise where the company has financial assets or liabilities in currencies other than Sterling.
There has not been any significant change in the companys sensitivity to foreign currency during the year.
