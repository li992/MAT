104 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued h Financial risk continued Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
For short-term transactions under one year, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agency.
For long-term transactions, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2007 the largest two counterparty exposures related to Treasury transactions were 5.3m and 4.4m and held with institutions with long term Standard & Poors credit ratings of AA and AArespectively.
These exposures represent 30% and 25% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
