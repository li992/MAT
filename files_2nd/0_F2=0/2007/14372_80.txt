Contingent Liabilities The Group is party to legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
Other than as set out below the Group considers that these will not result in any material adverse effect on the Groups results of operations orfinancialposition.
In August 2003 the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
As at that date 2,971 components had been implanted of which approximately 2,471 were in the USA, 450 in Australia and 50 in Europe, the first component having been implanted in December 2001.
As at 31 December 2007 1,029 implants required revision surgery as a result of some patients not achieving adequate fixation and settlements had been agreed with patients in respect of 977 of these revisions.
A provision of $154m was established in 2004 for the estimated cost of settling patient claims.
In 2007, this provision was increased by $22m to reflect an increase in anticipated costs to settle outstandingand future claims.
The total amount paid out to 31 December 2007 in settlements, legal costs and associated expenses has been $195m of which $60m was recovered from the insurer who provided the primary layer and 65% of the first excess layer in the Groups global product liability programme.
A further $22m was received during 2007 from a successful legal settlement.
The balance of $113m is due from five other insurers who have declinedcoverage.
A provision of $41m remains available to cover the estimated cost of settling pending and future claims by patients assuming that insurance cover continues to be declined.
The key variables in assessing the adequacy of the provision are the number of revisions likely to arise and the average cost of settling patient claims for those revisions.
Whilst managements estimate of the most probable net cost remains $154m, it is possible that the eventual outcome may be different.
Based on independent statistical projections carried outin2006 ofrevisionsthroughto the endof2009 the rangeofpossible costs is$133mto$194m.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these revisions and related matters constitute forward looking statements that are subject to uncertainties,  outcomeofsettlements as compared to the assumptions made in estimating claim amounts.
Smith & Nephew cannot provide assurance that these estimates will prove correct.
Depending on the number and average cost of future settlements, costs maybe greater orless thanthe amountprovided.
The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countriesin whichit has major operating companies.
Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant country.
Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In those countries where there is no company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups major defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US were closed to new employees in 2003 and replaced by defined contributionplans.
Retirement Benefit Obligation continued Defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost are measured using the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement.
ii  onaweighted average basisand include allfunded and unfunded plans.
The interest cost and expected return on plan assets are reported as other finance costs.
Actuarial losses of $22m 2006 gain of $32m, 2005 loss of $12m were reported in the Group statement of recognised income and expense making the cumulative charge to date $80m 2006 $58m, 2005$90m.
Retirement Benefit Obligation continued The contributions made in the year in respect of defined benefit plans were: UK Plan $20m 2006 $30m, 2005 $76m : US Plan $11m 2006 $19m, 2005 $51m : and Other Plans $8m 2006 $6m, 2005 $9m.
For 2008, the agreed contribution rates to the UK defined benefit pension plan are 20.2% of pensionable earnings plus supplementary payments of $14m.
Payments to the US defined benefit plan in 2008are estimated to be $11m.
$7m is estimated to be paid to the otherfunded defined benefit plans.
The total cost charged to income in respect of the Groups defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 31 December 2007 there were no outstanding payments due to be paid over to the plans 2006 nil, 2005nil.
The amount recharged in the year was $2m 2006 $2m, 2005 $2m.
The amount receivable at 31December2007 was nil 2006 nil, 2005 nil.
Retirement Healthcare The Group has various obligations for the provision of retirement healthcare to employees.
