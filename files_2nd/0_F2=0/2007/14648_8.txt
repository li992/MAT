Statement of directors responsibilities in respect of the financial statements Company law requires directors to prepare financial statements for each accounting period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the end of the accounting period and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are both reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards, International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, as appropriate, have been followed, subject to any material departures being disclosed and explained in the notes to the financial statements: and provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the financial position and financial performance of the entity.
The directors are responsible for: keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with company law and, for the Group, Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards Regulation: and taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Companys website.
