22 Acquisitions There were no acquisitions during 2007.
Falanx Microsystems AS On 30 May 2006, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Falanx Microsystems AS Falanx, a graphics IP company incorporated in Norway for total consideration of 13.4 million, comprising 13.3 million cash consideration and 0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
Falanx develops graphics accelerator IP and software for semiconductor system-on-chip SoC vendors that deliver high-quality multimedia images without compromising performance, power consumption or system cost.
The acquisition ts the ARM strategy of enabling users to create SoCs seamlessly in their design process.
The Mali Graphics Processor Unit GPU is a combination of hardware and software that enables industry-leading 3D graphics and video on mobile phones, portable media players, set-top boxes, handheld gaming devices and automotive systems, providing the Group with full control over the development of its future 3D graphics solutions.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Falanx and synergistic benets that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Falanx acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
At 31 December 2006, the accounting for the Falanx acquisition was determined on a provisional basis because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identiable assets and liabilities were only provisional.
At 31 December 2007, final adjustments to these provisional values were recognised as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
These adjustments were recognised as if they had occurred at the date of acquisition.
