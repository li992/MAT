com 40 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Current taxation: The complex nature of tax legislation across the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates necessitates the use of many estimates and assumptions, where the outcome may differ from that assumed.
Deferred taxation: The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions in the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.
Provisions: The Groups reorganisation provisions are based on the best information available to management at the balance sheet date.
However, the future costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which may differ from those ultimately incurred.
Sales provisions are based on historic patterns: of redemption for promotions, product return rates for returns and warranties, and penalty rates from network operators.
The Group has extensive data in all areas: however, if the historic patterns on which the provisions are based change signicantly in the future, the financial statements may be materially impacted.
Provisions relating to the disposal of excess property necessitate assumptions in respect of period to disposal and exit costs, which may differ from the ultimate cost of disposal.
Transactions between segments are on an arms length basis and support costs are allocated to segments based on the extent to which they relate to the relevant business streams.

This review represented a consideration of the extent to which the carrying value of the Groups assets should be reduced either because they had no further use or because their useful economic lives had reduced signicantly.
The result of this review was an accelerated or one-off amortisation charge in respect of the following assets: 000 Billing infrastructure and customer management systems 8,908 Other 4,049 12,957 Both these items are expected to attract tax relief at 30% and accordingly a deferred tax asset of 10.6m was recognised at 1 April 2006.

7 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 Financial Statements 47 6 Share-based payments continued e Fair value models: Nil cost options with internal performance targets are valued using the market price of a share at the date of grant, discounted for expected future dividends to the date of exercise.
The fair values of other options with internal performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using the Binomial model.
The inputs into the Binomial model are as follows: 2007 2006 Expected volatility % 28.6 30.0 Risk free rate % 5.3 4.5 Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 Expected volatility has been arrived at by using the historical volatility of the Groups share price, and the volatility of the share price of similar companies, whose shares have been listed for longer than those of the Group, over a period comparable with the expected lives of the options.
The assumptions made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise have been included by assuming an expected option life based on historical exercise patterns for each option scheme.
The fair values of options with external performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model.
The model combines the market price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the historical performance of the Groups shares.
The historical performance period reects a volatility of 27.4%.
A dividend yield of 2.0% has been assumed in the model.

The principal differences between the total tax charge shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 30% to profit before taxation are as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 profit before taxation 68,361 81,001 profit before taxation at 30% 20,508 24,300 Items attracting no tax relief or liability 4,376 4,945 Use of tax losses brought forward and income taxed at lower rates 17,263 12,961 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 5,761 4,857 Other timing differences not recognised in deferred tax 462 967 Total tax charge 1,398 10,460 Tax on items recognised directly in reserves is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Current tax credit on share-based payments 7,834 3,703 Deferred tax debit credit on share-based payments 3,535 15,820 Deferred tax debit credit on available-for-sale investments 1,094 74 3,205 19,597 The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the period: Timing Acquisition Share-based differences on Other timing intangibles payments capitalised costs Tax losses differences Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2006 5,851 27,179 2,163 6,432 9,341 34,938 Charge to income 6,567 3,115 1,499 9,064 2,990 17,255 Charge to reserves 3,535 1,094 4,629 Acquisition of subsidiaries 1,928 2,875 940 2,206 4,093 At 31 March 2007 1,212 26,759 2,211 16,436 7,463 51,657 No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either period, except where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had unused tax losses of 193.7m 2006 166.4m available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset of 16.4m 2006 6.4m has been recognised in respect of 56.8m 2006 20.3m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
7 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 Financial Statements 49 8 Taxation continued No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 136.9m 2006 146.1m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
Included within unrecognised tax losses are amounts of 12.0m 2006 16.7m that will expire between 2014 and 2018 and 14.0m 2006 9.3m that will expire between 2008 and 2013.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 March 2007 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 26.1m 2006 25.9m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2007 do not take into account the impact of the proposed reduction in the UK statutory rate of corporation tax from 30.0% to 28.0% from 1 April 2008 as announced in the March 2007 Budget, as the relevant legislation was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

7 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200 Financial Statements 51 12 Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets continued Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs, which are generally based on geographical location.
The carrying amount of goodwill by geographical location is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 UK 341,124 261,437 France 88,594 91,077 Germany 71,062 73,054 Spain 45,583 46,564 Other 92,589 96,498 Total goodwill 638,952 568,630 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash ows for the following fifteen years based on a country-specic growth rate ranging from 1.7% to 3.0%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The average pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 10%.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period, all of which are based on historical patterns and expectations of future market developments.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
The Directors have not identied any CGUs where it is considered likely that key assumptions may change to such an extent that it would lead to a significant impairment loss.
The fair value of non-current asset investments has been determined using European Venture Capital Association guidelines.
Movements in fair value are recognised in reserves.
a Principal Group investments The Group has investments in the following subsidiary undertakings, which principally affected the profits or losses or net assets of the Group.

The valuation is derived from the discounted future cash ows expected to be generated by the customer bases, after a deduction for contributory assets: rights, subject to future performance criteria, to a share of transactional revenues generated by AOL access and TalkTalk customers on AOL sites.
These rights are valued at 34.7m, based on discounted expected future cash ows, after a deduction for contributory assets: a license to continue to use the AOL brand for a limited period, valued at 9.9m using the relief from royalty method, which reects the discounted future cash ows saved from not incurring royalty payments.
the write-down of property, plant and equipment and software development to its market value: the recognition of deferred tax, principally in respect of accelerated capital allowances and intangible assets: and the recognition of unrecorded liabilities and provision for onerous contracts.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of AOL is attributable primarily to the removal of a significant competitor to TalkTalk in the residential broadband market and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from the combination.

com 60 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21 Financial instruments The Business Review on pages 10 to 16 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have in managing the Groups currency and interest rate risk.
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities: The interest rates on oating rate financial assets and liabilities are linked to market interest rates, mainly on an overnight basis or for one, two or three month periods.
Future cashows arising from these financial assets and liabilities depend on interest periods agreed at the time of rollover and, as such, all financial assets and liabilities are classied as oating rate.
The weighted average interest rate for loans and overdrafts was 4.29% 2006 3.28%.
The book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is as follows: 2007 2006 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 000 000 000 000 Financial assets By instrument Cash at bank and in hand 38,088 38,088 51,840 51,840 Short-term bank deposits and money market funds 72,972 72,972 46,253 46,253 Available-for-sale investments 2,314 2,314 5,153 5,153 Forward currency contracts 80 80 Financial liabilities By instrument Bank overdrafts 12,170 12,170 21,136 21,136 Other uncommitted bank loans 10,000 10,000 20,039 20,039 Committed bank loans 707,637 707,637 320,054 320,054 Loan notes 483 483 15,558 15,558 Forward currency contracts 267 267 The fair value of available-for-sale investments has been provided by third-party fund managers.
Other fair values have been arrived at by discounting future cashows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts to period-end market rates or rates as appropriate to the instrument.
Foreign exchange derivatives: The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge transactional exposures.
These contracts are mainly denominated in Euros, South African Rand and US Dollars and primarily cover stock purchases and operating expenses.
The Group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities and also for short-term liquidity management.
The Group currently holds no currency option contracts.
At 31 March 2007, the total notional principal amount of outstanding currency contracts was 171.0m 2006 129.4m.
Within this balance, 6.0m 2006 nil is held in relation to cash ow hedges, for which the associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to operating profit when the transactions occur over the next 12 months.
The balance relates to investments in and loans to the Groups non-Sterling operations.
The amount transferred to income in respect of forward currency contracts was an expense of 0.3m 2006 income of 0.2m.
The Group does not hedge the balance sheet translation risk of its foreign operations.
Functional currency: The functional currency of individual companies within the Group varies with the territory in which they operate and the five currencies in which subsidiary companies prepare their accounts are: Sterling, Euro, South African Rand, Swiss Franc and Swedish Krona.
Material financial assets and financial liabilities held by Group companies, which differ from their functional currency are as follows: 2007 2006 Euro Swiss Franc Other Total Euro Swiss Franc Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Financial liabilities By functional currency of Group operation Sterling 343,325 383,972 35,574 762,871 213,664 10,588 18,996 205,256 The financial liabilities hedge net inter-company currency exposures and, as such, do not create foreign exchange risk in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives: No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identied and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
Securities and guarantees: None of the financial liabilities are secured over Group assets.
Although some guarantees are given by Group companies, these are to cover commercial obligations and, as such, no additional credit risk is created.
Insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within one year.
Reorganisation: Reorganisation provisions at the start of the period relate principally to a store closure programme launched in the period ended 30 March 2002, the costs associated with the ongoing implementation of shared service functions, and the reorganisation programme started in the prior period to integrate Onetel with the rest of the Group.
The costs of the Onetel integration were estimated at 22.3m see note 4, principally being redundancy and other employee costs, contract termination costs, and network and customer migration costs.
These costs have been substantially incurred in the period ended 31 March 2007 and the remaining costs are expected to be incurred in the period ending 29 March 2008.
The release in the period relates to redundancies and contract termination costs, which were over-estimated at 1 April 2006.
The impact of this release is offset by further provision for network and customer migration costs, which were under-estimated at 1 April 2006.
Sales: Sales provisions relate to cash-back and similar promotions, product warranties, product returns, and network operator performance penalties.
Sales provisions are expected to be used within the following 12 to 24 months.
Other: Other provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and all other provisions, principally being the anticipated costs of unresolved tax issues and legal disputes, and costs associated with onerous contracts.
