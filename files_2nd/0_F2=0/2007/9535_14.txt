80 Notes to the Company accounts 35 Accounting policies continued Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits The Company operates two types of pension schemes.
Firstly, there is a defined benefit retirement scheme for which the amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of net assets or liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of the plan assets.
The cost of providing for the scheme is charged to the income statement over the periods relating to the employees service.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the profit and loss account in retained earnings and presented in the reconciliation of movements in equity shareholders funds note 42.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2006.
For employees who do not participate in the above scheme the Company makes payments in respect of pensions directly to the employee.
These employees have the option to invest in a direct contribution scheme which the Group has set up or they may make their own arrangements.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20.
The Company makes equity-settled share-based payments which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
For those share schemes which do not include non-market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo method at the grant date and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the date of grant.
For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the IFRS charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
