Overview of Our Business Our Performance in 2007 Governance Accounts & Notes Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 63 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 Basis of Preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amount of income and expenses during the year.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
During the year, the Group has reclassified all costs relating to unsuccessful exploration activities to a separate line item on the face of the income statement.
Comparative figures have been restated as a result of this reclassification.
Additionally, the fair values provisionally accounted for on the acquisition of CH4 during 2006 have been finalised in the year and this has resulted in a restatement of prior year comparatives.
Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Critical Estimates and Judgements The main estimates made by the Group included decommissioning estimates, estimates of future capital expenditures used in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation DD&A and hydrocarbon reserve estimates.
See accounting policy on each item for further information.
The main judgements made by the Group included the forecasts and assumptions used in the impairment review of non-financial assets, tax provisioning and deferred tax asset recognition.
See accounting policy on these items for further information.
Investments in Associates The Groups investments in its associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
These are entities in which the Group has significant influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
The financial statements of the associates are used by the Group to apply the equity accounting method.
The reporting dates of the associates and the Group are identical and all use consistent accounting policies.
The investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associates, less any impairment in value.
The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associates.
Joint Ventures The Group is engaged in oil and gas development and production through incorporated and unincorporated joint ventures.
The Group accounts for its share of the results and net assets of these joint ventures as jointly controlled assets.
In addition where the Group acts as operator to the joint venture, the gross liabilities and receivables including amounts due to or from non-operating partners of the joint venture are included in the Group consolidated balance sheet.
64 Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued Revenue Recognition Revenue from sales of oil and natural gas is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, which is when title passes to the customer.
For oil and natural gas, this generally occurs when product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism.
Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which Venture has an interest with other producers is recognised on the basis of Ventures working interest entitlement method.
Consequently, for sales in respect of oil liftings sold, adjustments for overlift liftings greater than production entitlement and underlift production entitlement greater than liftings are recorded against cost of sales at market value.
Tariff revenue from the use of the Groups platform and pipeline facilities is recognised when products are physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism.
Segmental Reporting Segmental reporting follows the Groups internal reporting structure, and accordingly, its primary segment reporting is by business segment.
A business segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those segments operating in other economic environments.
In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group comprise two classes of business, oil production and gas production.
Foreign Currency Translation a Functional and Presentation Currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Companys functional and presentation currency.
b Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and development expenditure is accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
Expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area is expensed immediately to the income statement.
Overview of Our Business Our Performance in 2007 Governance Accounts & Notes Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 65 Expenditure directly associated with an exploration well is capitalised on a licence by licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, on the balance sheet under exploration assets, until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
Costs will continue to be held as an asset if the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery.
When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off.
When proved reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, the relevant costs are transferred to development and producing assets.
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, is capitalised within development and producing assets on a field by field basis.
Upon commencement of production, these costs are amortised on a unit of production basis that is calculated on budgeted capital expenditure and proven and probable reserves.
Property, Plant and Equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if any, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Plant and machinery 1033% Office equipment 25% Motor vehicles 25% Buildings 5% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net realisable value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
These CGUs are aligned to the business unit and sub-business unit structure that the Group uses to manage its business.
Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.
Exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances the exploration asset is allocated to development producing assets within the same field and tested for impairment.
Any such impairment arising is recognised in the income statement for the period.
Where there are no development producing assets within a business unit, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Impairment reviews on development producing assets are carried out on each CGU identified in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Ventures CGUs are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.
66 Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the CGU is compared with the associated expected discounted future post-tax net cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the income statement as impairment.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using forward curve pricing for the first five years and managements view of the long term price thereafter.
Cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate of 8%.
Forecasted production profiles are determined on an asset by asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been an impairment charge in an earlier period, that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
Deferred Consideration Deferred consideration relates to the future cash consideration payable in respect of acquisitions which is contingent on the outcome of future events.
When an acquisition agreement provides for an adjustment to the consideration contingent on future events, provision is made for that amount if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.
The amount provided is included in the cost of the acquisition.
When the final amount payable is determined, or when revised estimates are made, the acquisition cost and provision are adjusted accordingly.
Deferred consideration is recorded at its fair value.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and comprise oil in tanks and pipelines and materials.
Cost values for stocks of oil are calculated using a weighted average cost for the year.
Under Overlift Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Groups jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period.
The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative production less stock is underlift or overlift.
Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales, such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlement basis.
The Groups share of any physical stock is accounted for at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are stated at fair value on the basis that they are available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets and that the sale is highly probable at the balance sheet date.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, bank overdrafts and deposits held at call with banks with maturity dates of less than three months.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options, for the acquisition of a business, are included in the cost of acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been declared.
Overview of Our Business Our Performance in 2007 Governance Accounts & Notes Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 67 Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
They have therefore, been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
Shares acquired by and disposed of by the EBT are recorded at cost.
The cost of shares held by the EBT is deducted from shareholders equity.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Convertible Bonds The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity.
The remainder of the proceeds of the convertible bond represents the value of the equity conversion option and this component of the bond is recognised in shareholders equity.
Capitalised Interest Interest is capitalised gross of related tax relief during the period of construction, where it relates either to the financing of major projects with long periods of development, or to dedicated financing of other projects.
All other interest is charged against income.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
At the point of settlement, any payments or receipts relating to hedge transactions are included in revenue.
Cash Flow Hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are recognised in equity net of deferred income tax.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity, including the associated deferred income taxes, are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity, and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives that Do Not Qualify for Hedge Accounting Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Such derivatives are classified as at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
68 Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 continued Fair Value Estimation Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values are used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values are calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Taxation The tax charge, including UK corporation tax and overseas corporate tax, represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are taxable or deductible in a different period.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current UK Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT is charged as a tax expense on chargeable field profits included in the income statement and is deductible for UK corporation tax.
Deferred PRT is provided for in full, using the effective PRT rate method.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Operating Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Pension Costs The Group pays contributions to personal pension schemes of employees, which are administered independently of the Group.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Share-Based Payments The Group currently has various share-based payment schemes for its employees and Directors, details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The fair value of share-based awards is determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of key performance measures, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is taken to the employee benefit reserve.
The proceeds on exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
The fair values are calculated using a binomial option pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee turnover after vesting and early exercise.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, risk free rate of interest and patterns of early exercise of the plan participants.
Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full at the commencement of oil and natural gas production.
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
A corresponding tangible fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production and transportation facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the fixed asset.
Unwinding of discount is treated as a finance cost.
Overview of Our Business Our Performance in 2007 Governance Accounts & Notes Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 69 Disclosure of Impact of New and Future Accounting Standards The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards were mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2007: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures The application of IFRS 7 has resulted in additional disclosures in the Group accounts in Notes 18 and 25.
The application of IFRS 7 has not had a material impact on the Groups income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement.
Amendment to IAS 1 The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital and how it manages its capital.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment The application of IFRIC 8, IFRIC 9 and IFRIC 10 did not have a material impact on the financial statements.

72 Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3. Business Combinations Acquisitions in 2007 Acquisition of WHAM Energy plc On 12 November 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of WHAM Energy plc WHAM, a listed company based in the United Kingdom.
The total cost of the combination was 15,600,000 and comprised cash and an issue of equity instruments.
The Group issued 1,065,464 ordinary shares with a fair value of 7.16 each, being the published price of the shares of Venture Production plc at the date of exchange.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of WHAM as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately before the acquisition are shown below.
The fair value adjustments relate primarily to the recognition at fair value of the acquired interests in oil and gas assets and the impact of the adoption of Venture accounting policies.
The impact of recognising deferred tax on the fair value of the assets and liabilities is to reduce the value of the net assets acquired and thereby increase the goodwill on acquisition.

Operating Profit The following items have been charged credited in arriving at operating profit: Restated 2007 2006 000 000 Over Underlift 2,848 1,791 Operating expenses 76,269 74,288 Well workover expenses 9,693 7,706 Exploration costs written off 18,144 3,872 Development costs written off 11,207 Impairment of assets 33,463 Depreciation, depletion and amortisation 82,463 88,242 Employee expenses Note 31 14,275 8,282 Share-based payments Note 16 4,981 10,169 Operating lease rentals: Land and buildings 629 384 Foreign currency gain loss 496 2,465 Exploration costs written off relate to unsuccessful exploration activities where hydrocarbons were not encountered.
Development costs written off reflects the write-off of the original drilling investment in the Amanda field in 2003.
During 2007, Venture commenced a major seismic reprocessing and interpretation study on the entire Trees production hub, which will be completed during 2008.
Whilst the analysis of the remaining potential in the southern part of the Sycamore development has not yet been completed, preliminary results of this study suggest that in the central part of the Sycamore field there is limited re-investment opportunity.
Accordingly, an impairment charge of 24,500,000 has been made, reducing the carrying value of the Sycamore field to its value in use.
Analysis will be finalised upon completion of further technical work on this development during 2008.
Impairment of assets also includes a write-down of 8,963,000 of the appraisal oil well on the Pilot field, which was drilled in 2007 and produced heavy oil with higher viscosity than expected.

Earnings Per Ordinary Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the EBT and treasury shares.
2007 2006 Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 000 48,175 81,593 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue thousands 135,479 126,565 Basic earnings per share pence per share 35.6 64.5 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: convertible debt and share options.
The convertible debt is assumed to have been converted into ordinary shares and the net profit is adjusted to eliminate the interest expense and the unwinding of discount on convertible debt less the tax effect.
For the share options, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
Overview of Our Business Our Performance in 2007 Governance Accounts & Notes Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 77 The number of shares calculated as above is deducted from the number of outstanding share options to give the number of share options with dilutive effect.

During the year, the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the CH4 acquisition were finalised.
This has resulted in the recognition of a deferred PRT liability of 1,141,000 and an additional deferred income tax liability of 3,589,000.
The impact of the above was to increase goodwill arising on the acquisition by 4,730,000 to 46,517,000.
The 2006 comparatives have been restated to reflect this.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently, if there are any indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to CGUs, that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
As noted above, the main element of goodwill relates to the acquisition in 2006 of CH4.
Impairment tests for CH4 are carried out based on future cash flows of GMA.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations are based on the life of field models for the CGU.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding future production, oil and gas prices and operating costs.
The discount rate used for the calculation was 8%.
Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Disposal Groups On completion of the acquisition of CH4, the Group decided to dispose of its interest in NSIP ETS Limited to its associate company, North Sea Infrastructure Partners Limited.
The disposal of the Groups interest in the company occurred on 22 January 2007 Note 5.

The provision has been based upon existing technology, current legislation requirements and discounted using a rate of 7.5% 2006: 7.5%.
The estimated decommissioning costs and the pre-tax discount rate applied take into account the effects of inflation and risks and uncertainties concerning amounts to be settled in the future.
Financial Instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Market Risk Venture is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign exchange and commodity prices.
The Group actively monitors these exposures.
To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
The Groups objective is to reduce, where it deems appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices.
It is the Groups policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures.
The Group expects that any loss in value for these instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Group uses the pound sterling as its reporting currency.
As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements, primarily in the US dollar and euro.
Consequently, it enters into various contracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign exchange rates to preserve the value of assets and commitments.
In general, the Groups revenues in crude oil sales are denominated in US dollars, while its gas sales revenues are denominated in pounds sterling.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to reduce significant exposures to movements in foreign currency exchange rates through hedging foreign currency exposure for up to 50% of forecast net US dollar revenues.
Venture also uses forward contracts to hedge certain anticipated net revenues in foreign currencies.
The Group marks to market these forward contracts and thus changes in the forward contract fair values are booked to the income statement and reverse in the income statement over the term of the contracts.
88 Venture Production plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25.
Financial Instruments continued Net investments in foreign countries are long term investments.
Their fair value changes through movements of currency exchange rates.
In the very long term, however, the difference in the inflation rate should match the currency exchange rate movement, so that the market value of the foreign non-monetary assets will compensate for the change due to currency movements.
For this reason, the Group does not hedge the net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
If the average sterling US dollar rate had been 10% higher during 2007, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been 9,450,000 higher 2006: 6,954,000 higher.
If the average sterling US dollar rate had been 10% lower during 2007, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been 7,732,000 lower 2006: 5,690,000 lower.
If the closing sterling US dollar rate was 10% higher at 31 December 2007, the post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been 6,296,000 higher 2006: 8,530,000 higher.
If the closing sterling US dollar rate was 10% lower at 31 December 2007, the post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been 5,151,000 lower 2006: 6,979,000 lower.
Commodity Price Risk The Group has exposure to price risk related to anticipated revenues from crude oil and natural gas.
A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of the Group.
Accordingly, it enters into commodity futures, forward and option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated revenues.
To manage commodity price risk and deliver stability to the investment programme, the Groups policy is to allow hedging of commodity price exposure up to 50% of its oil and gas production.
In exceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of the Board, up to 75% of such production may be hedged.
Hedges have been put in place with a variety of providers.
If the average gas price had been 10% higher or lower during 2007, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been 4,365,000 higher or lower 2006: 5,670,000 higher or lower.
If the average oil price had been 10% higher or lower during 2007, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been 4,253,000 higher or lower 2006: 3,130,000 higher or lower.
Interest Rate Risk The Group manages its net exposure to interest rate risk through negotiating fixed rate financial debt in its financial debt portfolio.
The Group has no exposure to variability in its cash flows due to interest rate risk as it borrows at rates of interest which are fixed in advance.
At 31 December 2007, all of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates 2006: 12%.
Credit Risk Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade accounts receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair value.
The Groups policy is to deal with customers with an A rating or better where possible.
At 31 December 2007, 100% 2006: 100% of trade receivables were such customers.
The Group also has credit risk relating to cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with an A rating or better where possible.
100% of the cash held on deposit at 31 December 2007 2006: 100% was held with such institutions.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity, funding risks and related processes and policies are overseen by management.
Venture manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility.
Capital Risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure with a diversified range of funding including equity, convertible bonds, bank debt and privately placed loan notes.
The Group continually monitors its capital structure, to ensure this is in line with business needs, ongoing asset development and to fund potential future acquisitions.
During the year, its borrowing base banking facility was replaced with a medium term committed corporate debt facility of 365,000,000, 151,000,000 was raised through the issue of 3.25% unsecured convertible bonds and a further $424,000,000 and 25,000,000 in a private placement of notes was secured with US and UK institutional investors.
As a result, there are externally imposed covenant requirements with which the Group is fully compliant.
These covenants include the ratio of borrowings to EBITDA and interest cover.
