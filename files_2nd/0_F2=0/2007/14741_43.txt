Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2007 93 28.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group and Company adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 April 2005.
Exposure to commodity price and volume risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to risk.
The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.
The Risk Committee, a standing committee of the Board comprising three executive directors and senior managers from the Generation and Supply and Finance functions, oversees the control of these activities.
This committee is discussed further in the Directors Report.
The Groups Treasury function is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts.
The departments operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Risk Committee and Audit Committee.
i Risk Counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk Credit risk arising from the Groups normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with group policies and procedures.
Generally, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided.
Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.
Credit risk management for the Groups regulated businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is controlled by the individual business units.
The Groups greatest credit risks lie with the non-regulated operations of the Generation and Supply business and the activities carried out by the Groups Treasury function, for which specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities, are applied.
Liquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet liabilities, is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
Generation and Supply Exposure to credit risk in the supply of electricity and gas arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables.
The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed before commencing, and during, their contract of supply.
Domestic customers creditworthiness is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information.
Exposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty: i holds an investment grade credit rating: or ii can be assessed as adequately credit worthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies: or iii can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions: or iv can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the Risk Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the Group Board.
Credit support clauses or side agreements are typically included or entered into to protect the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery.
Within the Generation and Supply business, increasing volumes of commodity derivative products are now traded through cleared exchanges to further mitigate credit risk.
Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Services Authority FSA and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are monitored by category of credit risk and are subject to approved limits.
At 31 March 2007, the Group had pledged 90m 2006 100m of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received 696m 2006 660m of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on commodity price risk.
Treasury In relation to the Groups liquidity risk, the Groups relationship banks defined as those banks who support the companys financing activities through their ongoing participation in the committed lending facilities that are maintained by the Group, are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of A or equivalent allocated by a recognised major ratings group.
In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.
Bank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and are adjusted for future volatility and probability of default.
Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Risk Committee.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Energy commodity price risk The Groups Generation and Supply business faces exposure to energy commodity price movements as part of its normal course of business.
This arises from the Groups requirement to source gas or electricity to supply customers, or to procure fuel to produce electricity from its generation assets.
The Groups strategy is to mitigate the economic risks associated with this exposure through a selection of term contracts and the flexibility of its portfolio of generation assets.
Within these parameters, the Group procures gas, electricity and fuel through longer term contracts including forwards, futures contracts and financial instruments which will reduce the volume required to be procured in the short-term market.
Short-term demand management is commented upon in Energy Volume Risk, below.
In addition to the procurement of commodities, the Group can choose to manage this exposure through strategic decision making in the retail market or through managing the output of its generation plant beyond the level currently committed to cover customer demand.
Commodity contracts entered into are done so primarily for own use or hedging purposes.
A number of contracts do not qualify for own use or hedge accounting under IAS 39 and are therefore subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
The resulting energy commodity price risk is quantified by the use of a Value at Risk VaR model which considers exposures in all commodities and provides an estimate of the potential change to the Groups forecast profits over a given period and to a given confidence level.
The calculated financial risk is controlled through the imposition of a number of risk limits approved by the Risk Committee.
Energy volume risk Inherently linked to the Groups energy commodity price risk is the Groups energy volume risk.
This risk, which is predominately short term, arises from the requirement to match volumes of procured gas, electricity and power station fuel with demand for gas and electricity by its customers, which can vary from expectations and result in a requirement to close the resulting positions at unfavourable prices.
This risk is managed through the ability to increase or decrease energy production either in the form of flexible purchase contracts which are marked-to-market or assets such as pumped storage generating plant, flexible hydro generating plant, standby oil plant and gas storage.
Again, the Group has assessed its portfolio of sources of production and supply and has been able to identify contracts which are held for own use which are not accounted for as financial derivatives and those which are held to manage commodity price and volume risk.
Certain physical contracts are treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand.
Currency risk In addition to spot purchases of foreign currency, the Group uses forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk.
All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates.
Significant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Risk Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to is: 2007 2006 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 677.7 777.1 The Group has no subsidiaries outside the UK and therefore has minimal exposure to currency translation risk arising from operations outside the UK.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk derives from the Groups exposure to changes in value of an asset or liability or future cash flows through changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage this risk by stipulating that a minimum of 50% of Group borrowings be subject to fixed rates of interest, either directly through the debt instruments themselves or through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than sterling, cross currency swaps.
Although interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings.
Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades.
The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise commercial paper issued at interest rates less than LIBOR and cash advances from the European Investment Bank EIB.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Financial derivative instruments disclosure For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market, interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted MTM foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.
The net movement reflected in the Income Statement can be summarised thus: 2007 2006 m m Operating derivatives Total result on operating derivatives i 134.5 176.1 Less: amounts settled ii 195.8 190.5 Movement in unrealised derivatives 61.3 14.4 Financing derivatives and hedged items Total result on operating derivatives i 117.7 47.3 Less: amounts settled ii 107.1 3.8 Movement in unrealised derivatives 10.6 43.5 Total 50.7 57.9 i Total result on derivatives in the income statement represents the total amounts charged or credited to the income statement in respect of operating and financial derivatives.
ii Amounts settled in the year represent the result on derivatives transacted which have matured or been delivered and have been included within the total result on derivatives.
The net financial assets Iiabilities have been offset in this note.
The following is an analysis of these items for financial reporting purposes.

Commodity contracts fair values are based on published price quotations where liquid markets exist and on future price forecasts where markets are illiquid.
The estimates applied reflect the managements best estimates of these factors.
