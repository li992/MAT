Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB IFRIC and in accordance with the policies applied for the year ended 31 March 2006.
The Group and Company financial statements are expressed in Sterling, which is their functional and presentational currency.
Sterling is the functional currency because it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
a Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries to 31 March 2007.
Companies, other than subsidiaries, in which the Group has an investment representing 20% or more of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence, are treated as associates.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of the results and reserves of these companies based on the latest available accounts.
Other companies, in which the Group has an investment representing 20% or more of the voting rights but where the directors consider that the Group does not exert significant influence, are not treated as associates and are accounted for as investments.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no exdividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on each such security.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits is accrued to the end of the year.
Rental income and direct property costs are recognised on an accruals basis.
c Expenses All expenses and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
An analysis of retained earnings broken down into revenue distributable and capital non-distributable items is given in note 16.
In arriving at this breakdown, expenses have been presented as revenue items except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment: expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect, the investment management fees are allocated 50% to revenue return and 50% to capital return to reflect the Boards expectations of long term investment returns.
One third of the management fees is deemed to relate to the administration of the Trust and charged to revenue.
The remainder is split on the same basis as finance costs see below and 50% charged to capital return.
The overall result is that two thirds of management fees are charged to revenue and one third to capital.
All performance fees are charged to capital return.
d Finance costs The finance cost in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is calculated so as to give a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
One half of the finance costs is charged to capital return.
TR Property Investment Trust 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued e Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between capital and revenue using the Groups effective rate of tax for the year.
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
The Company is an investment trust under s. 842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and, as such, is not liable for tax on capital gains.
Capital gains arising in subsidiary companies are subject to capital gains tax.
f Properties The purchase and sale of properties is recognised to be effected on the date unconditional contracts are exchanged.
g Investments When a purchase or sale is made under contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All the Groups investments are defined under IFRS as investments designated as fair value through profit or loss but are also described in these financial statements as investments held at fair value.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which, for quoted investments, is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Unquoted investments or investments for which there is only an inactive market are held at fair value which is based on valuations made by the directors in accordance with IPEVCA guidelines and using current market prices, trading conditions and the general economic climate.
Investment properties are revalued six-monthly by independent valuers.
The purchase and sale of properties is recognised to be effected on the date unconditional contracts are exchanged.
In its financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at fair value.
h Movements in fair value Changes in the fair value of all investments held at fair value are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Group Income Statement.
i Non-current liabilities All loans and debentures are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on settlement.
The costs of arranging any interest-bearing loans are capitalised and amortised over the life of the loan.

Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.

The difference is explained below: 2007 2006 000 000 Net profit 240,017 280,676 Corporation tax at 30% 72,005 84,203 Effects of: Non-taxable gains on investments 71,001 84,246 Tax relief on expenses charged to capital 2,921 3,081 Non-taxable UK dividends 2,903 2,539 Overseas withholding taxes 10 100 Overprovision in respect of prior years 45 71 Disallowable expenses 28 96 Other short term timing differences 272 234 Current tax charge for the year 1,287 858 The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 8,168,000 2006: 5,301,000 arising as a result of excess management expenses and excess non trade debits.
These expenses will only be utilised if the Group has profits chargeable to corporation tax in future accounting periods.
It is considered too uncertain that the Group will generate such profits and, on this basis, the deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has not been recognised.
A deferred tax asset of 50,000 was utilised during the year ended 31 March 2006.
Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
In respect of properties held in subsidiaries, provision for capital gains tax has been made for revaluation surpluses not sheltered by brought forward capital losses or non trade debits.
c Provision for deferred taxation The amounts of deferred taxation provided at 30% comprise: 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total Return Return Return Return 000 000 000 000 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances 168 168 Capital gains 4,094 4,094 2,994 2,994 4,094 4,094 168 2,994 3,162 Shown as: Deferred tax liability 4,094 4,094 168 2,994 3,162 TR Property Investment Trust 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 8 Taxation continued The movement in provision in the year is as follows: 2007 2007 2007 Revenue Capital Total Return Return 000 000 000 Provision at the start of the year 168 2,994 3,162 Deferred tax charge in Group Income Statement: Accelerated capital allowances 168 168 Capital gains 1,100 1,100 Provision at the end of the year 4,094 4,094 9 Earnings per ordinary share Total earnings per ordinary share are based on the net profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 237,798,000 2006: 279,715,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, being 343,385,123 2006: 344,113,406.
Revenue earnings per ordinary share is based on the net profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 14,054,000 2006: 11,838,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, being 343,385,123 2006: 344,113,406.
Capital return per ordinary share is based on net capital gains of 223,744,000 2006: 267,877,000 and on the same weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
TR Property Investment Trust 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 10 Investments held at fair value continued v Substantial share interests The Group held interests in 3% or more of any class of capital in five investee companies.
None of these investments is considered significant in the context of these financial statements.
11 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations, for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement and debtors for accrued income.
The Group has little exposure to credit and cash flow risk.
Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
This risk is taken into account by the directors when arriving at their valuation of these items.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: market price risk i. e. movements in the value of investment holdings caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement : foreign currency risk: and interest rate risk.
The Investment Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
i Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Further information on the investment portfolio and investment policy is set out in the Managers Report on pages 9 to 17. ii Foreign Currency Risk A proportion of the Groups portfolio is invested in overseas securities and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group may hedge foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency.
iii Interest Rate Risk The Group has fixed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rates on the debenture loans are fixed, details are set out in note 13.
In addition to the debentures, the Group has two unsecured multi-currency revolving loan facilities which carry a variable rate of interest based on the currency drawn, plus a margin.
48 TR Property Investment Trust Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued iv Use of Derivatives It is not the Groups policy to enter into derivative contracts other than for the purposes of hedging against price movements in the value of particular constituents of the portfolio or interest rate exposures.
The non interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the investment portfolio.
Floating rate financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of bank balances, loans and overdrafts: their respective interest rates are linked to LIBOR.
