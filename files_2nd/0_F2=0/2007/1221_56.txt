1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Recently issued accounting standards continued In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.
159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.
115 FAS 159 which provides companies the irrevocable option to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
The accounting provisions of FAS 159 will be effective for the Companys financial year ending 31 December 2008.
The Company is in the process of determining the effects, if any, the adoption of FAS 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements, but do not believe the impact of the adoption will be material.
In June 2007, the EITF issued the statement EITF 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements, which discusses the accounting for arrangements with third parties and whether transactions should be reported gross or net in the financial statements.
We currently already apply the provisions of EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent and as such do not believe the impact of adoption will be material.
In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS No.
141R, Business Combinations FAS 141R, which amends principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
The statement also amends guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
FAS 141R will be effective for the Companys financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2009.
Accordingly, any business combinations the Company engages in will be recorded and disclosed following existing GAAP until 1 January 2009.
We expect FAS 141R will have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements when effective, but the nature and magnitude of the specic effects will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date.
We are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements.
In December 2007, the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 SAB 110 to amend the SECs views discussed in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 SAB 107 regarding the use of the simplied method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with FAS 123R.
SAB 110 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2008.
We will continue to use the simplied method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with SAB 107, as amended by SAB 110.
