Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust ESOT.

The Group now has a single class of instruments dilutive to ordinary shares: employee share options.

Financial liabilities borrowings continued g Financial instrument risk management objectives and policy Interest risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate collars to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
The Groups policy is to fix or cap interest rates on at least 50% of its borrowings.
Credit risk The credit risk in liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with investment grade credit ratings.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk from its customers as exposure is spread over a large number of entities.
Liquidity risk The Group minimises liquidity risk by continually refreshing the maturity profile of its debt.

Share-based payments i Employee share schemes.
The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and a Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme.
Grants under ESOS are normally exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant and normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Grants under the SAYE scheme are normally exercisable after 3 or 5 years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.

Of these, 3,251,460 were directors share options and are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The prescribed targets have been met in respect of all options granted in 2004 and earlier years amounting to 822,000 ordinary shares identified by an asterisk in the above table.
ii Fair value of ESOS and SAYE share-based payments The estimated fair value of the share-based payments granted during the year have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.

The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The expected dividend yield is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

The scheme and its performance criteria are fully explained in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 78. iv Fair value of Co Investment Plan share-based payments The Monte Carlo model has been used to determine fair value of Co Investment Plan grants.
Assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2007 2006 Share price at grant pence 345p 245p Exercise price pence Nil Nil Average expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 5% 4% Expected dividend yield 1% 2% Average share price volatility FTSE Real Estate comparator group market related performance condition assumption 23% 21% Average correlation FTSE Real Estate comparator group market related performance condition assumption 80% 80% Fair value per option 165p 109p The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a five year period.
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.
v Cash settled share-based payments National Insurance payments due on the exercise of non-approved ESOS options are considered cash settled share based payments.
