Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 36 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies General information Victrex plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in the Japanese joint venture, which became a wholly owned subsidiary with effect from 30 March 2007 see note 22.
Prior to this date the Japanese joint venture was accounted for on the equity accounting basis in accordance with IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
After this date it was accounted for as a wholly owned subsidiary in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 10 December 2007.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued during the period which are not yet effective, and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not deemed to be significant.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, shall apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and therefore the Group plans to adopt IFRS 7 for the first time in the year ending 30 September 2008.
The application of IFRS 7 in the year ended 30 September 2007 would not have affected the balance sheets or income statement but would have resulted in changes to disclosures provided in respect of financial instruments.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing control.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 37 Joint venture The activities of the Japanese joint venture were governed by a joint venture agreement between the Company and Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. Certain key management decisions required the co-operation of both parties.
The Groups share of profits less losses of the Japanese joint venture was included in the consolidated income statement on the equity accounting basis until it became a wholly owned subsidiary with effect from 30 March 2007.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Segment reporting A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
A business segment is defined as a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Group has determined the primary reporting segment to be geographic as the Group is engaged in providing products or services within particular geographic environments that are subject to varying risks and returns.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operated the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates and, c All resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 38 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 30 years Plant and machinery 10-30 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 years Computers and motor vehicles 3-5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 39 Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in order to allocate the cost over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Knowhow 10 years The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and, differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from contractual payments is recognised by reference to completion of a specific milestone in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
Royalty income is recognised when the amount payable is known.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.
Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 40 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Employee benefits Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of recognised income and expense as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are being immediately recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the parents share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or Total Shareholder Return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and it has been reliably estimated.
Net financing income and expense Net financing income and expense comprises interest payable on borrowings, interest received on funds invested and charges on bank loans and overdrafts.

The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined using value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from financial budgets and plans, which have been approved by the Board, discounted using the Groups estimated weighted average cost of capital 9%.
BDF is a key raw material for the vast majority of our products and associated downstream activities.
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the associated acquisitions is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of the Victrex business as a whole.
The goodwill associated with the acquisition in March 2007 of the remaining 49% share in Victrex-MC, Inc is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of our Japanese activities.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would generate a different impairment test outcome.
Knowhow The knowhow arose on the acquisition in December 1999 associated with the supply of our key raw material BDF.
It is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life and has approximately two years remaining to be charged.
The charge is recognised within cost of sales in the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges, using forward exchange contracts, a proportion of sales denominated in a foreign currency.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
The majority of schemes outside the UK are defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which certain employees of subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited to join the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

Share-based payments Share option arrangements granted before 7 November 2002 exist.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to these grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
All options are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows: Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Victrex 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme came to the end of its 10 year life in 2005.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.

The price payable for each share shall be a price determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of a share on the date of grant or the date of purchase.

Victrex Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Each year the Victrex LTIP can award executive Directors options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 100% of basic salary.
The awards normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date subject to the Groups performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which the award may become exercisable is dependent on two performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : The Companys TSR element of an award will vest in full if the Companys TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro-rata basis for the median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period and, The Groups EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
