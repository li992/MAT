The carrying amount of goodwill for the Groups CGUs are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Scotsman Ice 52.6 57.4 Delfield 27.0 29.4 Frimont Castelmac 22.5 24.5 Kysor Panel Systems 22.2 24.3 Scotsman Beverage Systems 9.1 9.9 Jackson 11.9 13.0 Merrychef 12.6 12.6 Convotherm 6.4 6.2 Frau Group 2.6 2.6 Fabristeel Group 7.9 Cleveland 0.5 Goodwill carrying value 175.3 179.9 The Group annually tests goodwill for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from its most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity on growth rates which do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets in which the Group operates.
The projected cash flows are discounted based on the Groups estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10%.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
Based on current projections, management believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
