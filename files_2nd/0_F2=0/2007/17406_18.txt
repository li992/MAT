Warning about unsolicited investment contacts Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turns out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
Protecting investments from identity theft Criminals may steal shareholders personal information, putting a holding at risk.
Suggestions for protecting shareholdings: l Ensure certificates are kept in a safe place or hold shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
l Keep all correspondence from the Registrar which shows a shareholder investor code in a safe place, or destroy correspondence by shredding.
l When changing address, inform the Registrar.
If a letter from the Registrar is received regarding a change of address and there has been no recent move, contact the Registrar immediately.
The shareholder concerned may be a victim of identity theft.
l Know when the dividends are paid.
Shareholders may wish to consider having their dividends paid directly into their bank or building society account, both for the convenience and the resulting reduction in the risk of the cheque being intercepted or lost in the post.
To take advantage of this dividend mandate facility, contact the Registrar, telephone within the UK: 0871 664 0300 calls cost 10 pence per minute plus network extras, or from overseas: 44 20 8639 2157: or alternatively complete a form online using the Share Portal service at www.
l If using electronic means to access investor information passwords and log in details should be kept secure.
l On changing bank or building society account, inform the Registrar of the details of the new account and respond to any letters the Registrar send about this.
