Annual Report and Accounts 2007 65 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2007 12 Share-based payments Share options Equity settled share options are granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and are subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options are granted is based on a percentage of the employees salary and since 2001 approximately 800 employees have been granted options each year.
Options granted in 2004 onwards are subject to a minimum three year performance target of earnings per share EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets are EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets are not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options will lapse.
Also, gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the options.
They are subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary of grant.
The target had not been met in previous years and none of these option grants was exercisable.
However the target has now been met and these option grants are exercisable from June 2007.
Some options granted in 2000 and before are still outstanding.
These were subject to a performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 2% over the three year performance period.
Since that target has been met all these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, shares are allocated to directors and certain key executives of the group based upon a percentage of salary and are subject to performance conditions over a three year period.
At 31st March 2007, shares allocated in 2004, 2005 and 2006 at 31st March 2006, shares allocated in 2003, 2004 and 2005 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
For allocations made in 2004 onwards the release of shares is subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR compared to those companies ranked 51 to 150 in the FTSE index over a three year period.
All shares are released if the company ranks in the 76th percentile or above.
None of the shares are released if the company ranks in the 50th percentile or below.
If the company ranks between these percentiles 35% to 100% of the shares are released on a straight line basis.
In addition EPS growth must be at least equal to UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three year performance period before any release is made.
For allocations made prior to 2004, 50% of the allocation is subject to the relative TSR target described above.
For the remaining 50%, release is subject to absolute TSR growth over the three year period.
All shares are released if the absolute TSR growth is 45% or more.
Pro-rata allocations on a straight line basis of between 50% and 100% are released if absolute TSR growth is between 30% and 45%.
Half of the allocated shares are released if TSR growth is 30%.
No shares are released if growth is below 30%.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK and Overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The SIP trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are allocated to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the Overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.
401k approved savings investment plans 401k plans In the US there are two 401k plans, one for salaried employees and one for hourly employees.
Salaried employees may contribute up to 50% of their base pay and hourly up to 20% of their base pay, both subject to a statutory limit.
Salaried employees choosing Johnson Matthey Plc shares matching are matched 100% of the first 4% contributed and hourly employees are matched 50% of the first 2% contributed.
Employees may contribute after one month of service and are eligible for matching after one year of service.
Further details of the directors remuneration under share-based payment plans are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 48.

The average share price during the year was 1,411.78 pence 2006 1,193.92 pence.
An adjusted Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to determine the fair value of the options granted.
The inputs to the model were: 2007 2006 Share price 1,282p 1,070p Exercise price 1,299p 1,070p Expected volatility 18.7% 27.1% Expected option life 5 years 5 years Expected dividend rate 2.32% 2.59% Risk free interest rate 4.77% 4.26% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the companys share price over the previous three years.
The expected option life takes into account the effects of expected early exercise, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on the history of previous option grants.
Given the low employee turnover and the consistency of the historical average option life Black-Scholes is considered to be a suitable stochastic model to use for fair valuing Johnson Mattheys share options.
The BlackScholes option pricing model is adjusted to take account of the cap which reduces the benefit and cost appearing in the accounts.
During the year 336,483 2006 423,030 shares were allocated under the LTIP with a fair value at allocation date of 504.7 pence per share allocation 2006 389.5 pence per share allocation.
The fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with a zero exercise price, a share price at date of allocation of 1,283.0 pence 2006 1,002.5 pence and an expected dividend rate of 2.35% 2006 2.76%.
The fair value was adjusted to take account of the TSR performance condition.
Activity relating to the LTIP was: 2007 2006 Number of Number of allocated allocated shares shares Outstanding at the start of the year 1,221,994 1,205,842 Allocated during the year 336,483 423,030 Forfeited during the year 14,808 29,626 Released during the year 198,730 Expired during the year 235,681 377,252 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,109,258 1,221,994 289,696 2006 281,921 matching shares under the SIP and 71,879 2006 91,595 shares under the 401k plans were allocated to employees during the year.
They are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
The total expense recognised during the year in respect of equity settled share-based payments, taking into account expected lapses due to leavers and the probability that EPS performance conditions will not be met, was 11.8 million 2006 7.6 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 67 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2007 13 Post-employment benefits 13a Group The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 2.8 million 2006 2.9 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The pension plans are final salary plans except for the new section of the UK plan which is a career average salary plan and the US hourly plan which is a fixed benefit based upon years of service.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2006 for the main UK pension plan and 30th June 2006 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2007 by qualified independent actuaries.
The other UK defined benefit pension plan was merged into the main plan on 1st October 2006.
The main assumptions were: 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 UK plans US plans Other plans UK plans US plans Other plans %%% %%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.60 4.25 3.52 4.40 4.25 3.57 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.10 2.13 2.90 2.31 Discount rate 5.40 6.00 4.87 4.90 5.75 4.66 Inflation 3.10 2.75 2.34 2.90 2.75 2.66 Current medical benefits cost trend rate 7.10 9.00 4.00 6.90 10.00 4.00 Ultimate medical benefits cost trend rate 7.10 5.00 4.00 6.90 5.00 4.00 The group uses certain mortality assumptions when calculating plan obligations.
The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The mortality tables used for the groups largest plan, which is in the UK, were PMA92C2006 with a one and a half years positive age rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2006 with a one and a half years positive age rating for female members retiring in normal health.

Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2007 2006 2007 2006 restated million million million million Catalysts Synetix including the process diagnostics business of Quest TruTec 194.3 193.9 132.4 132.2 Research Chemicals 21.3 21.3 Johnson Matthey Tennessee 19.0 21.5 Davy Process Technology Limited DPT 22.6 22.6 Other Catalysts 3.4 5.9 Precious Metal Products 3.9 2.1 Pharmaceutical Materials Macfarlan Smith including the business of United Farmaceuticals Limited 117.1 116.0 117.1 116.0 Pharma Services Ireland 17.6 19.4 Ceramics 0.4 399.2 403.1 249.5 248.2 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions including market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, the likelihood and timing of new product launches, foreign exchange rates, precious metal prices and other direct input costs.
Market share, changes in selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the three years.
New product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Apart from as discussed below, it is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.2% 2006 11.3%, as this is considered to be a discount rate a typical third party purchaser would also use to value the significant CGUs.
For Synetix the long term average growth rate is 5% 2006 5%, for Research Chemicals 5% 2006 4%, for Johnson Matthey Tennessee 4% 2006 3%, for DPT 5% 2006 3% and Macfarlan Smith 5% 2006 6%.
For Pharma Services Ireland, where its cash flows are expected to grow significantly due to new prostaglandin product launches over the next few years, cash flow projections cover a five 2006 six year period and then a long term average growth rate of 6% 2006 6% is used to extrapolate these cash flows.
If some of these product launches do not happen as expected an impairment loss may arise.

Market risk includes currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
28a Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly on a currency by currency basis and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of the bond attributable to changes in interest rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges as they hedge the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bonds attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cash flows are expected to occur in 2010 and 2015 when the respective bonds which they hedge mature.
The interest element of the cash flow hedges is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2010 and 2015.
At 31st March 2007, 51% 2006 49% of the groups net debt and 45% 2006 52% of the companys net debt was at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.20% 2006 5.43%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 0.8% impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
28b Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
Within long term debt of 410.5 million at 31st March 2007 2006 454.7 million, the group had borrowings under committed bank facilities of 15.4 million 2006 191.0 million.
The parent companys long term debt at 31st March 2007 was 405.1 million 2006 327.1 million including committed bank borrowings of 15.4 million 2006 69.8 million.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.

It has significant investments outside the UK with the largest single investment being in the USA.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA, Europe, Japan and China by borrowing US dollars, euros, yen and renminbi respectively.
Although an element of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a large part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The group has designated the currency swaps and one loan as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.
The main currencies of the net debt after taking into account the effect of the currency swaps were: Group Group Parent company Parent company Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 million million million million million million million million Sterling 105.3 118.4 192.7 105.5 102.1 117.2 186.4 84.2 US dollar 170.5 287.5 12.1 36.5 164.6 152.6 1.1 16.2 Euro 232.2 173.1 7.6 250.2 184.4 Japanese yen 57.9 24.8 4.3 60.3 24.8 South African rand 24.8 2.3 1.8 15.4 Hong Kong dollar 17.4 17.4 2.4 Chinese renminbi 7.2 11.6 4.1 6.2 5.5 6.0 Swiss franc 5.9 0.4 1.8 2.2 South Korean won 2.7 4.3 2.4 Malaysian ringgit 1.2 0.1 1.6 8.7 Brazilian real 0.2 7.8 Other currencies 3.7 1.8 2.4 9.0 4.9 0.4 0.4 0.8 605.5 619.6 240.7 207.6 605.4 487.2 190.1 101.2 The group and parent company use forward exchange contracts, and occasionally currency options, to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2008.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5 cent 2.6% 2006 2.8% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 0.8% 2006 0.8% impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5 cent 3.4% 2006 3.4% movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling has a 0.4% 2006 0.6% impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
28d Credit risk Within certain divisions, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
As at 31st March 2007 and at 31st March 2006, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% of the companys market capitalisation.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
As at 31st March 2007, the maximum exposure with a single bank for net deposits was 11.3 million 2006 16.5 million for the group and 7.0 million 2006 14.4 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 0.8 million 2006 0.5 million for the group and parent company.
The group guarantees its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associates and its exposure at 31st March 2007 was 0.8 million 2006 1.5 million.
At 31st March 2007 the group and parent company guaranteed 3.3 million of the borrowings of subsidiaries of Endeka Ceramics, former subsidiaries of the group note 40.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2007 was 16.1 million 2006 155.0 million.

It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the unquoted available-for-sale investments.
The fair values of the bonds and interest rate swaps are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps is the market value of equivalent swaps which could be taken out at the balance sheet date with the same banks, the same maturity dates and identical terms.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency swaps represents the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year end forward exchange rates obtained from the banks the contracts are with.
The fair value of the embedded derivatives are calculated by using a suitable valuation technique.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their size, short term nature or the fact that they bear interest at floating rates.

42 Key sources of estimation uncertainty Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The group and parent company have made appropriate estimates when applying the accounting policies, but the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post-employment benefits The groups and parent companys defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified independent actuaries.
The details of the plans and assumptions used are described in note 13.
Goodwill The group has capitalised goodwill of 399.2 million and the parent company has 249.5 million.
Annual impairment reviews are performed which require various assumptions.
More details are given in note 15.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets which are not yet being amortised note 16 are also subject to annual impairment reviews based on discounted cash flow projections.
No impairment has been found.
Provisions and contingent liabilities As described in note 29 and the accounting policies, the group and parent company measure provisions and contingent liabilities at management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date.
Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine the tax charge included in the accounts.
If the tax eventually payable or reclaimable differs from the amounts originally estimated then the difference will be charged or credited in the accounts for the year in which it is determined.
