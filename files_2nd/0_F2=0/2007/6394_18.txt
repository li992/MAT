NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES GENERAL INFORMATION Galliford Try plc is a Company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales Registered Number 836539.
The address of the registered ofce is Galliford Try plc, Cowley Business Park, Cowley, Uxbridge, UB8 2AL.
Galliford Try is a construction and housebuilding group.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The amounts stated are denominated in millions m. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU adopted International Accounting Standards IAS, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of land and buildings, available for sale investments, retirement benefit obligations, share based payments, and financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments held for trading.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Material estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regards to establishing the following policies: i Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The determination of the value of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ows expected from these cash-generating units including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs and requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash ows.
Details of the impairment review calculation are included in note 10. ii Estimation of costs to complete In order to determine the result that the Group is able to recognise on its developments and construction contracts in a specic period, the Group has to allocate total costs of the developments and construction contracts between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period.
The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation.
However, Group management have established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made.
iii Dened benefit retirement benefit valuations In determining the valuation of dened benefit schemes assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:  expected return on plan assets  ination rate  mortality  discount rate  salary and pension increases Details of the assumptions used are included in note 33.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Galliford Try plc, its subsidiary undertakings and the Groups share of the results of joint ventures.
The results of subsidiary and joint venture undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of any minority interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
SEGMENT REPORTING Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments, which are the primary basis of segment reporting.
The business segment reporting reects the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Segment results include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 39 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued JOINT VENTURES The Groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method.
Under this method the Groups share of profits less losses after taxation of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
Where joint ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Groups, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
JOINTLY CONTROLLED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS The Group accounts for jointly controlled operations and assets by recognising its share of profits and losses in the consolidated income statement.
The Group recognises its share of associated assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
AVAILABLE FOR SALE INVESTMENTS Available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
REVENUE AND PROFIT Revenue comprises the value of construction executed during the year, legal completions of housebuilding, contracted development sales and other invoiced sales, and excludes value added tax.
The results for the year include adjustments for the outcome of contracts, including joint venture operations, executed in both the current and preceding years.
These adjustments arise from claims by customers or third parties in respect of work carried out and claims and variations on customers or third parties for variations on the original contract.
Provision for claims against the Group is made as soon as it is believed that a liability will arise, but claims and variations made by the Group are not recognised in the income statement until the outcome is virtually certain.
Where it is foreseen that a loss will arise on a contract, full provision for this loss is made in the current year.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses and payments on account and are included in receivables and payables respectively.
BID COSTS FOR PFI PPP CONTRACTS Bid costs and investments relating to PFI PPP projects are not carried in the balance sheet as recoverable until the Group has been appointed preferred bidder or has received an indemnity in respect of the investment or costs, and regards recoverability of the costs as virtually certain.
RENT RECEIVABLE Rental income represents income obtained from the rental of properties and is credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease within revenue.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Material non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed in the income statement as exceptional items.
Examples of items which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, investments and property, plant and equipment, cost of restructuring and reorganisation of businesses, asset impairments and pension fund settlements and curtailments.
GOODWILL Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been restated.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets include brands, customer contracts and customer relationships acquired on acquisition of subsidiary companies.
The intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event.
Intangible assets are stated at amortised cost less any impairment.
Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods: a Brand on a straight line basis over 4-10 years.
b Customer contracts in line with expected profit generation.
c Customer relationships on a straight line basis over three years.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 40 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the historical or deemed cost of each asset to estimated residual value over its expected useful life.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The annual rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold buildings 2% On cost or reducing balance: Plant and machinery 15 to 33% Fixtures and ttings 10 to 33% In addition to systematic depreciation the book value of property, plant and equipment would be written down to estimated recoverable amount should any impairment in the respective carrying values be identied.
LEASES Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their anticipated useful lives or the length of the lease, whichever is shorter.
The capital element of outstanding obligations is included in payables.
The finance element of lease payments is charged to the income statement as finance cost.
INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENTS Inventories and developments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, including attributable overheads, and net realisable value.
Land is included within developments at its fair value at the point of recognition.
TRADE RECEIVABLES Short term trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
LONG TERM RECEIVABLES The Group operates a shared equity scheme, under which part of the agreed sales price for a residential property can be deferred until the earlier of 10 years, remortgage or resale of the property.
Amounts receivable by the Group under this scheme are disclosed as receivables due after more than one year and are fair valued at each year end, with the corresponding movement in fair value being deducted from revenue.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value.
For the purposes of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are also included as they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
BANK AND OTHER BORROWINGS Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are originally recognised at fair value.
Such borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between initial fair value and redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period to redemption.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Re-nancing costs associated with new borrowing arrangements are included within the borrowing amount and amortised over the period of the loan.
INTEREST INCOME Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.
TRADE PAYABLES Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate.
PROVISIONS Provisions for onerous leases and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination costs and employee termination payments.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using the pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 41 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments, mainly comprising interest rate swaps, are initially accounted and measured at fair value at the point the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement.
FOREIGN CURRENCY Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
INCOME TAX Current income tax is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation recorded in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is accounted for on an undiscounted basis.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited through the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, when it is charged or credited there.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS For dened contribution schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
For dened benefit schemes, the cost of providing benets is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess of the present value of scheme liabilities over the fair value of the schemes assets.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Gains and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are taken to the income statement as incurred.
ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN Own shares held by the Galliford Try Employee Share Trust The Trust are shown, at cost less any permanent diminution in value, as a deduction from retained earnings.
The charge made to the income statement for employee share awards and options is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant spread over the performance period.
Where such shares subsequently vest to the employees under the terms of the Groups share option schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees.
The equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The credits associated with the the amounts charged to the income statement are included in retained earnings until the awards are exercised.
DIVIDEND POLICY Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Group held by the Employee benefit Trust are deducted from total shareholders equity.

Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 43 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments, which are the primary basis of segment reporting.
As explained in the financial statements for 30 June 2006, with effect from 1 July 2006 the Construction activities have operated as two divisions, Building and Infrastructure, hence the business segments have been amended accordingly.
Due to the complexity of the integration of the Morrison Construction and PFI divisions into the Group for part of the previous year, the comparative gures have not been restated as it is impracticable.
As the Group has no material activities outside the UK, segmental reporting is not required by geographical region.
Inter-segment revenue is not material.

Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 50 8 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the employee share trust note 29, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plan.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

The Groups financial instruments principally comprise bank borrowings, cash and liquid resources that arise directly from its operations and its acquisitions.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
For financial risk disclosures refer to the Business Review.
The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The contracting operations of the Group generally generate cash and the planned growth of contracting activities is budgeted to be cash generative.
The housebuilding operations, however, are cash consumptive and the planned growth in housebuilding will require additional borrowings in addition to retained earnings to finance growth in the land bank and associated work in progress.
On a daily basis throughout the year, the bank balances or borrowings in all the Groups operating companies are aggregated into a total cash or borrowing gure in order that the Group can obtain the most advantageous interest rate.
All material activities of the Group take place within the UK and consequently there is little direct exchange risk other than payments to overseas suppliers who require settlement in their currency.
If there is any material foreign exchange exposure, the Groups policy is to enter into forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has no material currency exposure at 30 June 2007 2006: Nil.
The main risk arising from the Groups financial instruments is interest rate risk and this is reviewed by the board on a regular basis.
The Group policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk as long as the effect of various changes in rates remains within prescribed ranges.
Details of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group are set out below.
In accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.

33 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Groups principal funded pension scheme is the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme which is of the dened benefit type based on final pensionable salary with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Scheme was closed to all future service accrual on 31 March 2007.
All staff employees are entitled to join the Galliford Try Pension Scheme, a dened contribution scheme established as a stakeholder plan, with a Company contribution on a scale dependent on the employees age and the amount they choose to contribute.
Pension costs for the schemes were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Dened benefit schemes Expense recognised in the income statement before gains on curtailments and settlements 3.2 4.5 Gains on curtailments and settlements 5.2 2.0 4.5 Dened contribution schemes 4.0 1.8 Total included within employee benefit expenses note 3 2.0 6.3 DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The most recent valuation of the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme is as at 30 June 2006, using the projected unit method with a three year control period.
The assumptions used which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation were the investment return, which was assumed to be 5.2 per cent per annum on pre-retirement assets and 5.2 per cent on post-retirement assets, and the rate of increase in pensionable salaries, which was assumed to be 5.0 per cent per annum.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 104.1 million and that those assets represented 67 per cent of the value of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for the expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The Galliford Group Special Scheme is funded and provides benets based on final pensionable salaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was prepared using the attained age method as at 1 April 2005.
The assumptions used which had the most significant effect on the results of the valuation were the investment return, which was assumed to be 5.6 per cent per annum on preretirement assets and 4.6 per cent for post-retirement assets, and the rate of increase in pensionable salaries, which was assumed to be 4.8 per cent per annum.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 3.1 million and that those assets represented 70 per cent of the value of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for the expected future increases in pensionable salaries.

The fair value of the assets, long term rate of return expected and present value of the obligations at 30 June of the Groups dened benefit arrangements are as follows: 2007 2006 Value Value Return m Return m Equities 8.35% 84.2 64% 7.65% 74.3 69% Property 8.35% 7.65% 0.7 1% Gilts 5.35% 30.3 23% 4.65% 15.1 14% Bonds 5.70% 11.0 9% 5.30% 13.5 12% Cash 5.50% 5.9 4% 4.50% 4.4 4% 131.4 100% 108.0 100% Present value of dened benefit obligations 156.4 155.1 deficit in scheme recognised as non current liability 25.0 47.1 Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets at the balance sheet date.
A higher rate of return is expected on equity and property type investments, which is based on more realistic future expectations than on the returns that have been available historically.
The overall expected long term rate of return on assets is then the average of these rates taking into account the underlying asset portfolio of the pension scheme.
