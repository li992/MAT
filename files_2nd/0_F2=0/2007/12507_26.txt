99 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 b The profit for the year of 216.0m, before external dividends of 61.1m, includes 220.0m of dividends received from subsidiary undertakings.
On 23 February 2007 and 6 July 2007, the Company paid dividends to shareholders without sufficient distributable reserves being available in the Company, despite the fact that there were sufficient distributable reserves across the Group which the Company could call upon to make those payments.
As a result, the accounting treatment required by the Companies Act treats these payments as interest free loans to shareholders rather than as dividends.
In order to satisfy the Companies Act requirements, dividends have been passed up from subsidiaries to ensure sufficient distributable reserves are in place as at 31 December 2007.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 December 2007, shareholders approved a special resolution to release both shareholders and Directors from any liability to the Company in respect of the dividend payments and the shareholder loans have reverted back to being dividends.
c These costs reflect the cost of share option schemes in operation.
