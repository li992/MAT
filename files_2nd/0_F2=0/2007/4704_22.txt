Diageo Annual Report 2007 89 Retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The larger plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Canada.
All valuations were performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit method to determine pension costs.
The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit pension plans were carried out as follows: United Kingdom on 31 March 2006: United States on 1 January 2007: and Ireland on 31 December 2006.
The measurement dates used to calculate the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are the respective balance sheet dates.
In the United Kingdom, the Diageo Pension Scheme closed to new members in November 2005.
New employees in the United Kingdom now become members of the Diageo Lifestyle Plan, which is also a defined benefit pension plan.
The assets of the principal pension plans are held in separate funds administered by trustees to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The two largest pension plans are the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom and the Guinness Ireland Pension Scheme in Ireland.
For the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, the trustee is Diageo Pension Trust Limited.
The appointment of the directors to the board is determined by the Schemes trust documentation.
There is a policy that one-third of all directors should be nominated by members of the Scheme.
Two member nominated directors have recently been appointed from the pensioner member community and two from the active member community.
For the Guinness Ireland Pension Scheme, the appointment of trustees is strictly a company decision.
Currently the company makes three nominations and appoints three further candidates nominated by representative groupings.
The chairman is a former employee of the company and is viewed as independent.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benefits in respect of medical costs.
These plans are generally unfunded.
In addition, there are a number of other plans which provide post employment benefits other than pensions and medical benefits.
These plans are also included in the figures presented below.
a The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.
The 2007 assumption for medical inflation in the United States reduces by 0.5% per year to 5% 2006 and 2005 1% per year to 5%.
In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the largest plan which is in the United Kingdom is based on the mortality experience of that plan.
This mortality experience analysis was carried out in 2006 as part of the triennial funding valuation of that plan.
The assumption is based on the PA92 birth year tables with scaling factors based on the experience of the plan.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort effect.
The mortality assumptions for the other plans around the world are based on relevant standard mortality tables in each country.
For the main UK and Irish pension funds, the table below illustrates the expected age at death of an average worker who retires currently at the age of 65, and one who is currently aged 45 and subsequently retires at the age of 65: United Kingdom Ireland 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Age Age Age Age Age Age Retiring currently at age 65 Male 84.4 84.3 83.5 85.3 84.0 84.0 Female 87.1 87.1 86.4 87.9 86.9 86.9 Currently aged 45, retiring at age 65 Male 86.7 86.7 85.2 87.1 84.8 84.8 Female 89.4 89.4 88.1 89.7 87.8 87.8 90 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued b The amounts charged in respect of post employment plans to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of recognised income and expense for the three years ended 30 June 2007 are set out below: United United States Kingdom Ireland and other Total million million million million 2007 Operating profit Current service cost 57 17 24 98 Past service cost 4 4 Total charge to operating profit 61 17 24 102 Net credit cost to other finance income note 6 ii 36 17 5 48 Charge before taxation 25 29 54 Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on post employment plan assets 374 150 44 568 Expected return on post employment plan assets 230 70 24 324 Actual return less expected return on post employment plan assets 144 80 20 244 Experience gains and losses arising on the plan liabilities 100 7 17 110 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities 200 10 21 189 Actuarial gain recognisable in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities 244 97 18 323 Changes in the recognisable surplus of the plans with a surplus restriction 5 5 Total gain loss recognisable in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 244 97 13 328 2006 Operating profit Current service cost 58 22 24 104 Past service cost 1 1 2 Gains on curtailments 1 1 Total charge to operating profit 58 23 24 105 Net credit cost to other finance income note 6 ii 14 11 6 19 Charge before taxation 44 12 30 86 Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on post employment plan assets 513 84 15 612 Expected return on post employment plan assets 191 60 24 275 Actual return less expected return on post employment plan assets 322 24 9 337 Experience gains and losses arising on the plan liabilities 29 14 12 55 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities 2 149 36 183 Actuarial gain recognisable in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities 291 159 15 465 Changes in the recognisable surplus of the plans with a surplus restriction 6 6 Total gain recognisable in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 291 159 9 459 2005 Operating profit Current service cost 58 15 20 93 Past service cost 2 10 12 Gains on curtailments 18 1 19 Losses on settlements 2 2 Total charge to operating profit 42 25 21 88 Net credit cost to other finance income note 6 ii 4 9 4 9 Charge before taxation 38 16 25 79 Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on post employment plan assets 318 129 30 477 Expected return on post employment plan assets 194 62 24 280 Actual return less expected return on post employment plan assets 124 67 6 197 Experience gains and losses arising on the plan liabilities 3 15 12 24 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities 171 198 50 419 Actuarial loss recognisable in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities 44 146 56 246 Changes in the recognisable surplus of the plans with a surplus restriction 8 8 Total loss recognisable in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 44 146 48 238 Diageo Annual Report 2007 91 4 Employees continued United United States Kingdom Ireland and other Total million million million million Total cumulative gain loss recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense At 1 July 2004 Recognised in the year 44 146 48 238 At 30 June 2005 44 146 48 238 Recognised in the year 291 159 9 459 At 30 June 2006 247 13 39 221 Recognised in the year 244 97 13 328 At 30 June 2007 491 110 52 549 Included in the total cumulative gain recognised at 30 June 2007 is a cumulative gain of 7 million 2006 2 million: 2005 8 million in respect of changes in the surplus restriction.

Included in other assets in the United Kingdom at 30 June 2007 is cash of approximately 350 million intended for subsequent investment in bonds.
The expected long term rate of return on other assets in the UK has been adjusted to reflect this.
Included in the plan assets above is 1 million 2006 7 million: 2005 19 million invested in the ordinary shares of Diageo plc.
Post employment benefit assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether an individual plan is in surplus or deficit, as follows: 2007 2006 million million Non-current assets 38 14 Non-current liabilities 457 815 419 801 The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2007, to reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 3.25% per year 2006 and 2005 3.25% per year in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
This risk premium is a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
The groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by the trustees of the plan and or Diageo, as appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the return on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, and will be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual stock exposures.
In the United Kingdom, as at 30 June 2007, the target investment allocations for the Diageo Pension Scheme were approximately 55% of the assets in equities, 30% in bonds, 10% in property and 5% in other assets 2006 85%, 5%, 10% and nil, respectively.
In addition, the UK Diageo Pension Scheme uses interest rate and inflation swaps to help manage the mismatch between the Schemes assets and the present value of its liabilities.
At 30 June 2007, approximately 40% 2006 40% of the Schemes liabilities were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation through the use of swaps and the fair value of these swaps was a liability of 64 million 2006 asset of 3 million.
This amount is included in other assets in the table of fair value of plan assets.
For the principal Irish pension plan, as at 30 June 2007, the target investment allocations were approximately 45% of the assets in equities, 40% in bonds and 15% in property 2006 70%, 20% and 10%, respectively.
The trustees of the UK pension plans and principal Irish pension plan continue to review their investment strategies and have been using a phased approach to increase asset diversification and, subject to solvency triggers, a phased approach to progressively reduce risk by increasing the bond allocation and introducing swap investments.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, approximately 20% of the assets globally were transferred out of equities into either bonds or cash to be invested in bonds.
The discount rate is based on the yields of high quality, long dated, fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities.
For the UK pension plans, which represent approximately 70% of total post employment benefit liabilities, the discount rate is based on the i-Box over 15-year AA sterling corporate bond index at 30 June rounded to the nearest 0.1%.
A similar process is used to determine the discount rate for the non-UK plans.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans which provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least equivalent to Medicares prescription drug coverage.
A subsidy of 0.4 million has been received in the year ended 30 June 2007.

For these purposes, the value of the deficit, calculated using the trustees actuarial valuation of the Scheme, was ascertained through the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2006.
Following the completion of that valuation, Diageo has undertaken to make an annual 50 million cash contribution in each of the four years of the funding plan, and the first payment of 50 million was made in the year ended 30 June 2007.
Payments are made into an escrow account subject to an agreement between the group and the trustees, with release from escrow to either the group or the trustees determined by an agreed formula in the light of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2009.
Investment returns on the funds held in escrow accrue to the group.
This amount held in escrow is included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet and is not included in the table above.
In addition to the deficit funding, Diageo continues to make a cash contribution in respect of current service cost based on the trustees valuation: this contribution is expected to be 50 million in the year ending 30 June 2008.
Funding arrangements will be reviewed and adjusted in the light of future triennial actuarial valuations.
Contributions to other plans in the year ending 30 June 2008 are expected to be approximately 40 million.
