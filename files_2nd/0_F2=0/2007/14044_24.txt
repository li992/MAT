76 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
General information Serco Group plc the Group is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is Serco House, 16 Bartley Wood Business Park, Bartley Way, Hook, Hampshire, RG27 9UY.
These consolidated financial statements the financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements on pages 73 to 121 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group adopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures from 1 January 2007.
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification or valuation of the Groups financial instruments and covers disclosures only.
Presentation of financial information The primary statements within the financial information contained in this document have been presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
Previously, amortisation of intangibles was shown separately within administrative expenses in the income statement and was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share calculation.
Only amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition is now shown separately in the income statement and excluded from the adjusted earnings per share calculation.
The 2006 comparatives have been re-presented.
There is no change to operating profit or administrative costs in total as a result of this change in presentation.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and entities jointly controlled by the Company its joint ventures made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 77 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been carried forward as the unadjusted UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
Investments in joint ventures The Groups investments in joint ventures are reported in the financial statements using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the Groups share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of its joint ventures is combined line by line with similar items in the Groups financial statements or reported as separate line items within the Groups financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from long-term project-based contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy below.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Segmental information Segmental information is based on two segment formats: the primary format reflects the Groups management structure, whereas the secondary format is .
Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses.
Specific corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments.
Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventories and trade and other receivables excluding corporation tax recoverable.
Liabilities comprise trade and other payables, retirement benefit obligations, and other creditors.
Long-term project-based contracts The Group has a number of long-term contracts for the provision of complex, project-based services.
Where the outcome of such long-term project-based contracts can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
This is measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a long-term project-based contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs that it is probable will be recovered.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of costs is virtually certain.
Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables.
On contract award these bid costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Phase in costs directly related to phase in programmes of contracts are treated as an integral part of contract costs and are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion as described above.
78 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and comprise service spares, parts awaiting installation and long-term project-based contract balances.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at fair value or, if lower, at the present value of minimum lease payments determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly within equity in the Groups hedging and translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an income or expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the SORIE.
The current service cost represents the increase in the present value of the plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service in the current period.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefit becomes vested.
Gains and losses on curtailments or settlements are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 79 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Defined benefit obligations arising from contractual obligations Where the Group takes on a contract and assumes the obligation to contribute variable amounts to the defined benefit pension scheme throughout the period of the contract and it is not virtually certain that the contributions will be recovered from the customer, the Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the pension scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract is recognised as a liability at the start of the contract with a corresponding amount being recognised as an intangible asset.
The intangible asset, which reflects the Groups right to manage and operate the contract, is amortised over the contract period.
The Groups share of the scheme assets and liabilities is calculated by reducing the scheme assets and liabilities by a franchise adjustment.
The franchise adjustment represents the amount of scheme deficits that will be funded outside the contract period.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of pension obligations are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the SORIE.
Where the Group takes on a contract and assumes the obligation to contribute variable amounts to the defined benefit pension scheme throughout the period of the contract and it is virtually certain that the contributions will be recovered from the customer, the Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the pension scheme assets are recognised as a liability at the start of the contract with a corresponding amount being recognised as a financial asset at fair value, being the fair value of the reimbursable rights.
In the consolidated income statement, the expense relating to the defined benefit plan is presented net of the amount recognised for reimbursement.
The change in fair value of the reimbursable rights that is not presented in the income statement is reported in the SORIE.
Multi-employer pension schemes Multi-employer pension schemes are classified as a defined contribution pension scheme or a defined benefit pension scheme under the terms of the scheme.
When sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting for a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme, the Group accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
Current tax expense is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which these items can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset and liability in a transaction other than a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legal enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority where the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
80 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Assets held for use in the rendering of services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates to reduce the assets to their residual value over their estimated useful lives.
The principal annual rates used are: Freehold buildings 2.5% Short-leasehold building improvements The higher of 10% or the rate produced by the lease term Machinery 15% 20% Motor vehicles 10% 50% Furniture 10% Office equipment 20% 33% Leased equipment The higher of the rate produced by the lease term or useful life The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Research and development costs Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred unless the criteria for capitalisation is met see Other intangible assets policy.
Other intangible assets Customer relationships represent the value of contracts acquired on the acquisition of subsidiaries and are amortised over the average length of contracts of eight years.
Development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Development expenditure is amortised over the period in which the Group is expected to benefit.
This period is between three to eight years, or the length of the contract if longer.
Provision is also made for any impairment.
All other development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Assets under the course of construction are not depreciated.
Licences comprise premiums paid for the acquisition of licences, which are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the licence.
Franchises represent costs incurred in obtaining franchise rights and franchise goodwill arising on the acquisition of franchises.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchise.
Pension related intangibles represent assets arising in relation to the Groups right to manage and operate contracts where there is a defined benefit pension scheme and it is not virtually certain that contributions will be recovered from the customer but where the Groups obligation to contribute to the scheme ends when the contract ends.
The intangible assets represent the Groups share of scheme net liabilities on the date that contracts commence and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the contract life.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets annually to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 81 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Impairment losses and reversals are included within other expenses within the consolidated income statement.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were not fully vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn share option scheme open to eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes, Binomial lattice or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme, as set out in note 35.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take account of market conditions applicable to the option.
Accounting for PFI contracts Within Public Private Partnership PPP projects including Private Finance Initiative PFI projects, where the concession agreement transfers limited risks and rewards associated with ownership to the contractors, during the period of initial asset construction, costs incurred as a direct consequence of financing, designing and constructing the asset are shown as PFI assets in the course of construction within non-current trade and other receivables.
On completion of the asset construction phase, the asset is transferred within trade and other receivables to a PFI debtor.
Revenues received from the customer are apportioned between capital repayments and operating revenue.
The finance income element of the capital repayment is shown as notional interest receivable within investment revenue.
The Group has one 2006 one fully owned Special Purpose Company SPC which is used for the purpose of running the PFI business.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the contract.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that a trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is based on managements best estimate of the likelihood of the recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a bad debt provision account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the bad debt provision account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less.
This definition is also used for the consolidated cash flow statement.
Dividends Dividends are recorded in the Groups consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Loans Loans are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount of loans hedged by derivatives is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Loans which are unhedged are stated at amortised cost with accrued interest recorded separately from the associated borrowings within current liabilities.
Loans of certain SPCs and joint ventures are described as non recourse loans and classified as such only if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an obligation, under a guarantee or other arrangement, to repay the debt.
82 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs on the date that the derivative contract is committed to.
The Group designates derivatives as: a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or commitment cash flow hedge a hedge of net investment in a foreign entity Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement within finance costs, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, only gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where the forecast transaction or commitment results in a non-financial asset or liability, any gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the cost of the related asset or liability if the forecast transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure.
Gains and losses deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
For the ineffective portion of hedges or transactions that are not designated for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedge accounting has been applied for a forecast or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing Costs 1 January 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions 1 January 2008 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction 1 January 2008 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 83 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with below.
Revenue and profit recognition of long-term project-based contracts Revenue and profit is recognised for certain long-term project-based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by the proportion of costs incurred to estimated whole-life contract costs except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to use to calculate present values see note 13.
The carrying value of goodwill is 542.1m 2006 528.5m at the balance sheet date.
Retirement benefit obligations The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates see note 28.
The value of retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 142.6m 2006 249.3m.
Details of the impact of changes in assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations are disclosed in the Finance review page 37.

A dividend waiver is effective for those shares held on behalf of the Company by its Employee Share Ownership Trust note 32.
Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share EPS have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share.
EPS is shown both before and after amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition see note 14 and the gain on sale of PFI investments to assist in the understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data: Number of shares 2007 2006 Millions Millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 482.4 471.2 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options 6.8 5.5 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 489.2 476.7 Earnings 2007 2006 Earnings Per share Earnings Per share amount amount m Pence m Pence Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS being net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent 81.9 16.98 78.3 16.62 Less: Gain on sale of PFI investments 11.4 2.42 Add back: Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, net of tax of 0.9m 2006 - 0.9m 7.7 1.59 8.1 1.72 Adjusted earnings before amortisation of intangible assets and gain on sale of PFI investments 89.6 18.57 75.0 15.92 Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS 81.9 16.98 78.3 16.62 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 0.24 0.19 Diluted EPS 81.9 16.74 78.3 16.43 At 31 December 2007, options over 27,000 2006 3.3 million shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted earnings per share because their exercise price was below the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, anti-dilutive.

In 2007, these are shown within the Defence 90.9m and Civil Government 260.9m sectors respectively in line with how the Group monitors its goodwill internally.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial plans approved by senior management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on past practices, the Groups order book and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years including a terminal value based on an estimated growth rate of 2.25%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the UK.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for the Group are as follows: 2007 2006 % % Civil Government 11.8 13.5 11.8 13.5 Defence 11.3 12.3 11.3 12.3 Science 11.3 11.3 Transport 11.8 11.8 92 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements 14.

The directors estimate that the carrying amount of trade debtors approximates to their fair value.
As of 31 December 2007, trade receivables of 1.4m 2006 1.8m were considered to be impaired.
Impairments to trade receivables are based on specific estimated irrecoverable amounts and general provisions on outstanding balances greater than a year old unless there is firm evidence that the balance is recoverable.
The amount of the provision was only 1.4m as of 31 December 2007 2006 1.4m primarily because our customers have a sovereign credit rating being either Government organisations or blue chip private sector companies.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Neither impaired nor past due 334.6 275.1 Not impaired but overdue by less than 30 days 53.4 40.6 Not impaired but overdue by between 30 and 60 days 13.5 9.7 Not impaired but overdue by more than 60 days 16.6 14.3 Impaired 1.4 1.8 Bad debt provision 1.4 1.4 418.1 340.1 Movements on the Group bad debt provision are as follows: 2007 2006 m m At 1 January 1.4 1.3 Charged to income statement 0.5 0.5 Utilised 0.5 0.4 At 31 December 1.4 1.4 The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the reporting date is the fair value of trade receivables.

Financial risk management The Group held the following financial instruments at 31 December: Carrying amount 2007 2006 m m Financial assets Derivative financial instruments at fair value note 27 2.7 Loans and receivables at amortised cost Trade receivables note 20 418.1 340.1 Other financial assets note 26 0.2 1.3 Cash and cash equivalents note 21 185.0 217.9 606.0 559.3 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments at fair value note 27 13.3 24.8 At fair value through profit and loss Loans note 22 39.2 At amortised cost Loans note 22 330.9 364.8 Trade creditors note 25 173.7 127.6 Obligations under finance leases note 24 16.4 19.8 534.3 576.2 Net financial instruments 71.7 16.9 Financial risk The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that financial and non-financial risk arising from financial instruments is monitored and managed within acceptable and known parameters.
The Board delegates authority to the executive team to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury function acts as a service centre and operates within clearly defined guidelines and policies that are approved by the Board.
The guidelines and policies define the financial risks to be managed: specify the objectives in managing these risks: delegate responsibilities to those managing the risks: and establish a control framework to regulate treasury activities to minimise operational risk.
Credit facilities and liquidity management The Group maintains committed credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient available funds to maintain its ongoing operations.
The Groups main committed credit facility the Bank Facility, expires in December 2009 and comprises term loans of 26m and US Dollar 229m, and an undrawn 255m revolving credit facility.
The Bank Facility is unsecured and has financial and non-financial covenants and obligations typical of this type of arrangement.
The Group has a private placement for 117m outstanding which amortises in equal annual instalments from 2011 to 2015.
The private placement comprises a tranche of 83m and a tranche of US Dollar 55m, which is hedged by two cross currency swaps note 27a.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups business does not involve a significant amount of cross-border trade and consequently, the Group is not exposed to substantial foreign currency transaction risk as sales and costs are approximately matched within overseas operations.
Material transactional exposures that do arise are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.
The foreign exchange exposure on the US Dollar tranche of the private placement has been fully hedged into Sterling.
The foreign exposure on the US Dollar Bank Facility is hedged against the net investment in the subsidiaries in the US and an internal loan receivable denominated in US Dollars.
Central funding of individual business units gives rise to monetary assets and liabilities centrally and in the business units.
The currency of resultant debt is selected to ensure that any foreign exchange risk is borne and managed by the Groups treasury function, the risk of which is mitigated by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
102 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements 26.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is relatively low because a high proportion of trade and other receivables have a sovereign or close to sovereign credit rating and the Group has a large number of counterparties and customers.
External credit checks are completed for all new non Government customers before signing a contract above 100,000.
For credit vetting for new Government body customers, there is an internal review of the clients ability to pay and timeliness of payment.
The review includes a consideration of the expected contract budget as well as economic and industry factors and the budget holders position within the Government body.
At quarterly intervals, a management credit worthiness review for all ongoing customers with material outstanding balances is undertaken, including a review to determine if there has been any deterioration in the customers payment history and a review of the total credit authorised to the customer throughout the Group.
The Groups treasury function transacts with counterparties that have a minimum long term and short term public rating of single A and A1 P1 only.
It also ensures that no exposure to any one institution at any given time exceeds a pre-determined exposure limit.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises on variable rate borrowings under the Bank Facility.
The Groups policy is to hedge core borrowing requirements to protect against adverse interest rate movements.
Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk through its joint venture rail operations.
The joint venture has used commodity derivatives to mitigate some of this risk see note 27 c. 26 a Currency management The Groups currency exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses on financial instruments that are recognised in the income statement and equity arise principally with respect to US Dollar with Sterling and US Dollar with Canadian Dollar financial instruments.
The fluctuations in other exchange rates do not significantly alter the value of financial instruments.
At 31 December 2007, if the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.7m lower 2006 1.0m lower mainly as a result of exchange losses on cash and derivative financial instruments.
Equity would have been 0.6m lower 2006 0.8m lower mainly due to exchange losses on commodity futures contracts denominated in US Dollars.
At 31 December 2007, if the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against the Canadian Dollar, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.9m higher 2006 0.8m higher mainly as a result of exchange gains on US Dollar denominated non-current intercompany borrowings.
Equity would have been 0.4m higher 2006 0.4m higher due to Canadian Dollar denominated non-current intercompany borrowings.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 103 26 b Interest rate management An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk is set out below: i Financial assets 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average fixed average fixed interest rate interest rate Floating rate Fixed rate received Floating rate Fixed rate received mm % mm % Cash and cash equivalents 185.0 217.9 Other financial assets 0.2 1.2 6.00 1.3 1.8 6.12 185.2 1.2 219.2 1.8 ii Financial liabilities 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average fixed average fixed interest rate interest rate Floating rate Fixed rate paid Floating rate Fixed rate paid m m % m m % Non recourse Sterling loans related to PFI assets 22.5 7.35 24.8 7.35 Non recourse Canadian Dollar loans 36.8 4.53 37.4 4.53 Sterling loans 26.0 120.5 5.70 65.0 141.9 5.99 US Dollar loans 117.4 120.7 Other loans 2.9 4.8 8.00 8.7 5.5 8.00 146.3 184.6 194.4 209.6 Excluded from the above analysis is 16.4m of amounts payable under finance leases, which are subject to fixed rates of interest 2006 19.8m.
iii Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and on average balances of financial assets held throughout the past year.
A 100 basis point movement in interest rates with all other variables held constant, would have an impact on post-tax profit for the year to 31 December 2007 of 0.6m 2006 0.6m.
The variance is mainly due to interest exposure on floating rate borrowings.
The resulting impact on equity due to a 100 basis point movement is 1.7m 2006 2.1m mainly due to the movement in the fair value of derivative financial instruments held as cash flow hedges.

The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure that complies with loan covenants and other measures.
Access to capital takes many forms and includes but is not exhaustive to equity markets, debt capital markets and bank markets.
During 2007, the Group maintained sufficient debt facilities which ensured its objectives were met.
26 e Price risk management The Group is exposed to commodity price risk arising from the volatility in the price of fuel and manages this risk by holding commodity futures contracts.
A US Dollar 0.2 per litre increase in the price of fuel as at the balance sheet date would result in a 5.0m increase 2006 6.3m increase in equity.
There is no impact in the income statement resulting from a change in fuel prices.
The sensitivity to changes in fuel prices resulting from changes in exchange rates is included within the currency sensitivity analysis see note 26 a.

106 Serco Group plc Notes to the financial statements 27 a Forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group is committed is 50.1m 2006 77.3m.
These arrangements are mainly designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 18 months.
Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2007, the Group held a number of currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling.
The profile of these currency swaps held by the Group is as follows: 2007 2006 Receivable Receivable Notional USD Payable GBP Notional USD Payable GBP amount interest rate interest rate amount interest rate interest rate Maturity USDm % % USDm % % December 2007 39.0 6.8 7.6 August 2015 35.0 5.7 5.7 35.0 5.7 5.7 August 2015 20.0 5.7 5.7 20.0 5.7 5.7 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 15.6m 2006 26.0m.
All currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and the fair value movement of 4.5m has been deferred as a credit in equity.
No amounts have been recognised in the income statement except for a discontinued cash flow hedge.
A loss of 1.4m had been recognised in the hedging reserve and this is recycled to the income statement as the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
A loss of 0.3m 2006 loss of 0.5m has been included in the income statement, and the remaining loss of 0.6m is expected to be recognised in the income statement in 2008.
Fair value hedges During 2007, currency swaps and a forward foreign exchange contract, designated as fair value hedges, matured.
The currency swaps had a notional amount of US Dollar 31m receiving a fixed interest rate of 6.81% and paying a floating rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount.
The swaps were hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the Groups US Dollar denominated private placement loans.
The forward foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of US Dollar 15m was hedging the foreign exchange exposure on the final repayment of the Groups US Dollar denominated private placement loans.
A gain of 4.3m 2006 2.4m has been recognised in the income statement in respect of the forward foreign exchange contract and currency swaps offset by a loss of 4.0m 2006 2.5m arising on the maturity of the private placement loan.
27 b Interest rate swaps Cash flow hedges The Group uses an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on its non recourse loan related to PFI assets by swapping this loan from floating to fixed rates.
The profile of the interest rate swap is as follows: At 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 Notional Payable GBP Receivable GBP value interest rate interest rate Maturity m % % June 2015 23.4 7.3 LIBOR Apart from a small portion, the swap is designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement of 0.1m has been deferred as a credit in equity: 26,000 2006 0.1m has been recognised as a gain in the income statement within investment income and finance cost.
An amount of 0.1m 2006 3.8m has been offset against hedged interest payments made in the period.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 107 27 c Commodity futures contracts The Group uses commodity futures contracts in its joint venture train operations in order to protect itself from volatility in the price of fuel.
The Group has a contract expiring in 2011 whereby it pays a fixed rate of 0.2895 per litre and receives a floating rate for a variable quantity each month.
The floating rate is calculated as the daily 0.2% NWE price in US Dollars per tonne converted into litres and then into Sterling at the daily spot rate.
The commodity futures contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are highly effective and the fair value movement of 4.2m has been deferred as a credit in equity.
No amounts have been recognised in the income statement.
27 d Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has US Dollar denominated borrowings, some of which it has designated as a hedge of part of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US.
The carrying value of the designated borrowings was 24.6m 2006 25.0m.
The foreign exchange gain of 0.4m 2006 3.5m on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised within the Groups hedging and translation reserve.
The hedge is highly effective so no amounts have been recognised in the income statement.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group has accounted for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group operates and is a member of a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2007, including the proportionate share of joint ventures, was 75.0m 2006 64.7m.
28 a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK and Europe.
In addition, the Group has interests in joint ventures, which operate defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the funded plans are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
The Groups major plans are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method.
This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of salary growth, and long-term expected rates of return for plan assets.
Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Long-term expected rates of return for plan assets are based on published brokers forecasts for each category of scheme assets.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan and intends to exercise this right.
The amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are grouped together as follows: Contract specific - Virtually certain costs reimbursed The Group has an obligation to contribute to the pension scheme over the term of the contract.
At rebid any deficit or surplus would transfer to the next contractor.
Throughout the contract, it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed the expenditure required to settle the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract has been recognised as a liability.
The Group has recognised the right to reimbursement as a separate asset.
In the consolidated income statement, the expense relating to this defined benefit plan has been presented net of the amount recognised for the reimbursement, resulting in a nil charge to the income statement.
Contract specific - Not certain costs reimbursed These are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts.
The Group has recognised as a liability the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contracts with a corresponding amount recognised as intangible assets at the start of the contracts.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense the SORIE.
The intangible assets are amortised over the term of the contracts.
Non contract specific These consist of a pre-funded defined benefit scheme which does not relate to any specific contract the funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected salary basis and an unfunded defined benefit scheme, all of which do not relate to any specific contract.
Any liabilities arising are recognised in full.

Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 109 28 a Defined benefit schemes continued During 2007, certain of the Groups non contract specific schemes introduced a Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to liabilities.
The main asset classes that make up the LDI investments are gilts and corporate bonds with inflation and interest swap overlays, and the assumed expected rate of return is taken to be gilts 0.2%.
In some schemes, employee contributions vary over time to meet a specified proportion of the overall costs, including a proportion of any deficit.
The liabilities recognised in the balance sheet for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.

Pre-funded defined benefit schemes treated as defined contribution Serco accounts for certain pre-funded defined benefit schemes relating to contracts as defined contribution schemes because the contributions are fixed until the end of the current concession and at rebid any surplus or deficit would transfer to the next contractor.
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.

The loan was hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Non cash movements in 2006 primarily relate to a joint venture debt.
Certain terms of this debt were renegotiated in 2006 and this allows us to offset a related debtor and the non recourse debt in our accounts, thereby reflecting the economic reality of the contract.

The options are granted at market value and awards made to eligible employees are based on between 50% and 100% of salary as at 31 December prior to grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options may be forfeited if the eligible employee leaves the group before the options vest.
Details of the movement in all EOP options are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise Number of exercise options price options price 000 000 Outstanding at 1 January 16,530 2.42 24,695 2.22 Granted during the year 443 4.39 565 3.39 Exercised during the year 2,991 2.20 7,554 1.83 Lapsed during the year 258 2.83 1,176 2.31 Outstanding at 31 December 13,724 2.53 16,530 2.42 11,939,768 2006 13,577,169 of these options were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average contractual life of 4.48 years 2006 5.55 years.
The fair value of options granted under the EOP is measured by use of the Binomial lattice model.
The Binomial lattice model is considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it allows exercise over a longer period of time between the vesting date and the expiry date.
Notes to the financial statements Serco Group plc 117 35.
Share-based payment expense continued The inputs into the Binomial lattice model for options granted during the year are: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 475p 304p Weighted average exercise price 445p 339p Expected volatility 33.7% 39.8% Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk free rate 5.1% 4.8% Expected dividends 0.8% 0.8% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards made to eligible employees under the above schemes are structured as options with a nominal exercise price and may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant.
The extent to which an award vests and therefore becomes exercisable is measured by reference to the growth in the Companys earnings per share or total shareholder return over the performance period of three financial years.
Details of the movement in all LTIS and LTIP options are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise Number of exercise options price options price 000 000 Outstanding at 1 January 4,040 Nil 2,578 Nil Granted during the year 3,055 Nil 2,475 Nil Exercised during the year 33 Nil 335 Nil Lapsed during the year 22 Nil 678 Nil Outstanding at 31 December 7,040 Nil 4,040 Nil 1,529,440 2006 1,051,758 of these options were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average contractual life of 8.33 years 2006 8.35 years.
The fair value of options granted under the LTIS and LTIP is measured by use of a Monte Carlo Simulation model.
This model is considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under these schemes as it takes into account the changes in performance conditions by which the options are measured.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo Simulation model for options granted during the year are: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 425p 314p Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil Expected volatility 21.4% to 22.1% 23.6% to 27.0% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 4.7% to 5.5% 4.8% to 5.0% Expected dividends 0.8% 0.8% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

Share-based payment expense continued Sharesave 2004 The Sharesave 2004 scheme provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 20%.
The options can be exercised for a period of six months following their vesting.
Details of the movement in Sharesave 2004 options are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise Number of exercise options price options price 000 000 Outstanding at 1 January 6,274 1.72 7,057 1.72 Exercised during the year 6,094 1.72 175 1.72 Lapsed during the year 110 1.72 608 1.72 Outstanding at 31 December 70 1.72 6,274 1.72 The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average contractual life of nil years 2006 0.80 years.
Options were valued using the Black Scholes model as this model reflects the fact that the options are exercisable only for a short period of six months following their vesting.
An expected life of three years and three months is the mid point between the vesting and expiry dates.
The model used the following assumptions when the options were granted in 2004: Weighted average share price 260p Weighted average exercise price 172p Expected volatility 47.6% Expected life 3.25 years Risk free rate 4.7% Expected dividends 1.1% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year.
Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable UK law.
Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Fixed asset investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Share-based payment The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were not fully vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn share option scheme open to eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes, Binomial lattice or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the profit and loss account except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
The Company designates derivatives as: a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or commitment cash flow hedge a hedge of net investment in a foreign entity Gains and losses on fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred to the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For the ineffective portion of hedges or transactions that are not designated for hedge accounting under FRS 26, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the profit and loss account when the committed or forecast transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
However, where cash flow hedge accounting has been applied for a forecast or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where the Company hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the profit and loss account when the foreign operation is disposed of.

Accounting policies continued Current tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax The charge for taxation takes account of taxation deferred because of differences between the timing of recognition of certain items for taxation purposes and for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is considered more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on a non-discounted basis using tax rates in force at the date the timing differences are expected to reverse.
