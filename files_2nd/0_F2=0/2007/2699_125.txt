Concentrations of credit risk whether on or off balance sheet that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
The Group does not have a significant exposure to any individual customer, counterparty, or to any geographical region.
The Group conducts business with banks representing many nationalities, in most cases through offices and branches located in London and maintains strict limits over its exposure to any individual counterparty.
