Pensions The Company operates pension plans covering the majority of its employees.
The Company provides dened contribution pension benets to those of its employees who are not eligible to participate in its dened benefit pension plans.
The expense recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of those plans represents the contributions payable by the Company for the period at rates that are specified in the rules of the plans.
At the balance sheet date, the Company had paid over all contributions due to the plans.
The Company operates a number of funded dened benefit pension plans in the UK that provide benets based upon final pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The plan assets are held separately from the Companys assets in funds that are under the control of trustees.
Day-to-day management of the plan assets is carried out by independent investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in the Company.
Certain employees and former employees whose pension benets exceed the maximum that may be provided from the Companys dened benefit pension plans are entitled to an additional unfunded pension payable directly by the Company after their retirement.
The dened benefit pension plans operated by the Company are closed to new entrants.
The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the dened benefit pension plans were as follows: As at As at 29 December 30 December 2007 2006 % per annum % per annum Salary increases 4.25% 4.00% Increase to pensions in payment 3.25% 3.00% Increase to deferred pensions 3.25% 3.00% Long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.00% 7.00% 5.00% 7.00% Discount rate 5.75% 5.125% Ination rate 3.25% 3.00% The current life expectancies underlying the value of accrued liabilities were as follows: As at As at 29 December 30 December 2007 2006 Current pensioners at age 65 male 20.5 years 19.1 years female 23.4 years 22.0 years Future pensioners at age 65 male 22.2 years 20.4 years female 25.0 years 23.3 years 146 Tomkins Annual Report 2007 Accounts The fair value of the plan assets and the expected rates of return were as follows: As at 29 December 2007 As at 30 December 2006 Long-term Long-term expected expected rate of return Fair value rate of return Fair value % per annum million % per annum million Equities 7.95% 80.3 7.80 8.00% 81.8 Bonds 5.25% 5.75% 77.1 5.00% 71.2 Other assets 4.85% 0.6 4.20% 0.6 158.0 153.6 The net pension liability may be analysed as follows: As at As at 29 December 30 December 2007 2006 million million Present value of plan liabilities: Funded 145.7 154.4 Unfunded 0.1 0.1 145.8 154.5 Fair value of plan assets 158.0 153.6 Surplus deficit in the plans 12.2 0.9 Effect of the asset ceiling 18.1 2.7 Net pension liability 5.9 3.6 Changes in the present value of the benefit obligation were as follows: As at As at 29 December 30 December 2007 2006 million million At the beginning of the period 154.5 161.3 Current service cost 0.4 0.5 Interest cost 7.8 7.5 Settlements and curtailments 0.7 Actuarial gain 10.1 6.6 151.9 162.7 Employees contributions 0.1 0.1 Benets paid 7.1 8.3 Transfer of pension plan from a subsidiary 0.9 At the end of the period 145.8 154.5 Tomkins Annual Report 2007 147 Notes to the financial statements continued 11.

The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the degree of global capital market integration.
The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward-looking views of the financial markets as revealed through a the yield on long-term bonds and b the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices.
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgment based on their knowledge of the Companys plans.
The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected long-term risk premiums for each asset class are developed.
The nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected ination and real risk-free rate assumptions.
As a final consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop long-term equilibrium expectations.
The actual return on plan assets was 5.5% 2006: 5.1%.

Background The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Companys senior executives and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
The information provided below relates only to options and awards that were granted to persons who are employees of the Company.

Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding to the Companys employees at the end of the period was as follows: As at 29 December 2007 As at 30 December 2006 Weighted Weighted average average remaining remaining Outstanding contractual life Outstanding contractual life Number Years Number Years Range of exercise prices 150p to 200p 3,088,072 4.12 3,088,072 5.12 201p to 250p 3,424,635 5.88 3,419,950 6.86 251p to 300p 3,074,976 4.85 3,185,620 6.04 301p and higher 1,015,228 4.12 1,015,228 5.12 10,602,911 10,708,870 C. Other awards The Companys principal ongoing share-based compensation arrangements are the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan ABIP and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Both are restricted to the Companys senior executives.
ABIP provides an award of bonus shares and deferred shares based on the profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest after a period of three years.
Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares vest after a period of three years conditional on the participants continued employment with the Group.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested.
During 2007, awards were granted over 399,854 ordinary shares 2006: 373,092 ordinary shares under the ABIP.
PSP provides awards of shares which vest after a period of three years conditional on the Groups total shareholder return relative to its cost of equity over the vesting period and the participants continued employment with the Group.
During 2007, awards were granted over 2,295,249 ordinary shares under the PSP 2006: 3,056,804 ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards made under the ABIP is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made under these schemes during the period was 215.68p 2006: 271.97p.
150 Tomkins Annual Report 2007 Accounts The fair value of awards made under the PSP is measured using the Monte-Carlo valuation model.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of awards granted under the PSP were as follows: Year ended Year ended 29 December 30 December 2007 2006 Weighted average fair value 42.87p 91.79p Weighted average assumptions: Expected volatility 28.73% 23.05% Expected life 3.00 years 2.73 years Risk-free interest rate 4.44% 4.77% Dividend yield 5.00% 4.80% Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the awards.
In 2007, the compensation expense recognised in respect of other awards was 2.1 million 2006: 1.5 million.
Deferred tax At present, the Company does not recognise deferred tax assets because their future economic benefit is uncertain due to the extent of forecast tax losses available for surrender within the UK tax group to which the Company belongs.
