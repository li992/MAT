 The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts speculatively and only enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Marketrisk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a continuous basis and managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps interest rate swaps respectively.
Although the Groups cash flows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent economic rather than residual financial risk inherent in commodity payables and receivables.
Consequently, the Group is not substantively exposed to commodity price risk as defined in IFRS 7.
Since the impact on the Groups equity would be immaterial for a wide range of relevant commodity price changes, the Group has chosen not to perform sensitivity analysis on its commodity price derivatives.
The Group is also exposed to a limited extent to the equity price risk that attaches to its available for sale financial asset investments.
Even under highly improbable stressed market conditions, the impact on earnings or equity attributable to the crystallisation of equity price risk would be immaterial.
Accordingly, the Group has chosen not to disclose sensitivity analysis on equity price risk.
Foreignexchangerisk The Group operates across various national boundaries and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from forecast commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and the translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
 The Groups foreign exchange policy requires its subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency exposures against their functional currencies by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts.
The management of foreign exchange exposures incorporates both forecast transactions and recognised monetary items in the balance sheet.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, forward foreign exchange contracts with Group Treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on forecast transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups budgeting and forecasting systems enable subsidiaries to assign a high degree of probability to forecast transactions and this therefore qualifies them for designation as hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of designated forward foreign exchange contracts are initially taken to the cash flow hedging reserve in equity and are subsequently recycled to profit or loss when the underlying forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The fair value of a forward foreign exchange contract is determined by reference to the current applicable spot foreign exchange rate, as adjusted by the forward points and multiplied by the contracted nominal cash flows.
The forward points reflect interest rate differentials between the two relevant currencies.
Utilisation of cash flow hedging enables the Group to recycle the fair value movements accreted on forward foreign exchange contracts and to match them with the crystallisation of the foreign exchange risk attributable to the designated hedged items in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The effect of applying this accounting treatment is to reduce the underlying volatility of reported earnings.
Hedging documentation is subjected to regular internal and external review, which reduces the risk of hedging ineffectiveness.
Financial statements Annual report and accounts 2007 MondiGroup 107 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements 38 Financial risk management continued Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on recognised monetary items are fair valued at each reporting date.
Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at each reporting date to incorporate the underlying foreign exchange movements, as prescribed by IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, and any such movements naturally off-set against fair value movements on related forward foreign exchange contracts.
 Foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on the foreign currency exposures inherent in the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting dates presented, net of related forward positions.
The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historic currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

108 MondiGroup Annual report and accounts 2007 38 Financial risk management continued  The Group believes that for each functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure it is reasonable to assume a 5% appreciation depreciation of the functional currency.
If all other variables are held constant, the table below presents the impacts on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement if these currency movements had occurred.

It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
 The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earns interest at a variable rate and has variable rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
Although the Group also has fixed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings are held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is invariant to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
By exception, during the year ended 31 December 2006 the Group designated a portion of its fixed rate debt as the hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship, using a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap.
The hedging relationship did not result in any ineffectiveness in the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Financial statements Annual report and accounts 2007 MondiGroup 109 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements 38 Financial risk management continued  The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the two most significant are syndicated facilities denominated in euros and South African rand respectively see note 21.
Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
Interest rate swaps are ordinarily formally designated as cash flow hedges and are fair valued at each reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined at each reporting date by reference to the discounted contractual future cash flows, using the relevant currency-specific yield curves, and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The resultant effective portion of the fair value gains and losses are initially taken to the cash flow hedging reserve in equity and are subsequently recycled for offset against the interest cash flows arising on the hedged item.
Cash flow hedging enables the Group to recycle the fair value movements accreted on interest rate swaps from equity and to match them with the crystallisation of the cash flow interest rate risk attributable to the variable rate debt in the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.
Hedging effectiveness documentation is subjected to regular internal and external review, which reduces the risk of hedging ineffectiveness.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents also acts as a natural hedge against possible unfavourable movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between corporate saving and lending rates.
 The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable-to-fixed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to net variable rate exposure, as denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.

Creditrisk The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
Any credit risk arising from cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is deemed to be insignificant on the basis that nearly all relevant counterparties are investment grade entities assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligate the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.
The Group has also provided committed loan facilities to Mondi Packaging South Africa and Mondi Shanduka Newsprint.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table.
 million 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents 180 415 Derivative financial instruments 17 11 Trade and other receivables 1,289 1,259 Loans and receivables 6 18 Total credit risk exposure 1,492 1,703 Financial statements Annual report and accounts 2007 MondiGroup 111 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements 38 Financial risk management continued  The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no significant geographical concentration of credit risk, with each geographical segment representing a similar degree of exposure.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Of the total trade receivables balance of 1,117 million 2006: 1,077 million reported in the combined and consolidated balance sheet, credit insurance covering 379 million 2006: 198 million of the total balance has been taken out by the Groups trading entities to insure against the related credit default risk.
The insured cover is presented gross of contractually agreed excess amounts.
Liquidityrisk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities.
million 2007 2006 Expiry date In one year or less 185 175 In more than one year 1,025 Total credit available 1,210 175 Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash inflows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups  cash outflows, principally related to supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings, including finance lease obligations, plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables respectively.
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables takes place typically over a period of three to four months from recognition in the balance sheet and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash outflows may be longer-term in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets, which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
The Group also assesses its commitments under interest rate swaps, which hedge future cash flows from two to five years from the balance sheet date presented.
112 MondiGroup Annual report and accounts 2007 38 Financial risk management continued  Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The Groups financial investments, which are not held for trading and therefore do not comprise part of the Groups liquidity planning arrangements, make up the remainder of the non-derivative financial assets held.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities which are due to be settled in less than 12 months from maturity equal their carrying values, since the impact of the time value of money is immaterial over such a short duration.
