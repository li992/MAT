If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of the RPI but less than 15 percentage points, half of the options can be exercised.
For options granted prior to October 2004, if the options fail either initial performance condition, the three year assessment period will be rolled forward by a year and a re-test carried out at that time.
If the performance condition is satisfied, options can be exercised up to 10 years after the date of grant.
For options granted from 1 October 2004, no re-testing is permitted.

120 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Employee share compensation continued Executive share award plans a Total shareholder return TSR plan Under the TSR plan, participants are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
All conditional rights awarded vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 17 other companies.
TSR calculations are converted into a common currency US dollars.
The second performance test requires that the remuneration committee not recommend the release of awards unless it considers that there has been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by improvement in an adjusted earnings per share measure.
b Discretionary incentive plan DIP, formerly Diageo share incentive plan The first awards were in the year ended 30 June 2000 to a small number of senior executives.
The scheme involves awards of shares or ADSs over a three to five year period with performance criteria varying by employee.
Awards under the TSR plan and DIP were at nil award price.
For the three years ended 30 June 2007, the calculation of the fair value of each option and share award used the binomial share option plans and Monte Carlo share award plans option pricing models and the following weighted average assumptions: Executive Executive share option Savings share award plans plans plans 2007 Weighted average assumptions Risk free interest rate 4.9% 5.1% 5.0% Expected life of the options 60 months 35 months 36 months Expected volatility 18% 13% Dividend yield 4.0% 3.7% 4.0% Weighted average fair value of options awards granted in the year 144p 200p 841p Number of options awards granted in the year 8.3 million 2.7 million 2.1 million Fair value of all options awards granted in the year 12 million 5 million 18 million 2006 Weighted average assumptions Risk free interest rate 4.2% 4.3% 4.2% Expected life of the options 60 months 43 months 36 months Expected volatility 30% 29% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Weighted average fair value of options awards granted in the year 187p 224p 733p Number of options awards granted in the year 9.2 million 2.0 million 1.5 million Fair value of all options awards granted in the year 17 million 4 million 11 million 2005 Weighted average assumptions Risk free interest rate 4.6% 4.7% 4.6% Expected life of the options 60 months 40 months 36 months Expected volatility 30% 30% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Weighted average fair value of options awards granted in the year 165p 214p 649p Number of options awards granted in the year 10.7 million 2.9 million 0.8 million Fair value of all options awards granted in the year 18 million 6 million 5 million The risk free interest rate is based on the UK treasury coupon strips in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option.
The expected life of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The group uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model.
Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the groups shares, historical volatility of the groups shares and other factors.
Option holdings in the following tables are stated as ordinary share equivalents in pence.
Options prices are translated at the following exchange rates: grants at actual exchange rates: exercises and cancellations at average exchange rates: and closing balances at year end exchange rates.
