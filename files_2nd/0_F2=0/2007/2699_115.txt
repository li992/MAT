The charge in the table above includes 24 million of business improvement costs.
The majority of the restructuring provision relates to redundancy costs expected to be incurred in the following year.
Acquisition provisions relate to provisions set up at the time of prior year acquisitions.
Contractual, legal and other provisions relate to the Groups ongoing obligations relating to current litigation and the disposal of subsidiaries, investments and brands.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain, but such amounts in 2008 are not expected to be significant.
During the year, 8 million of provision obligations were transferred from other balance sheet accounts.
Cadbury Schweppes Annual Report & Accounts 2007 107 Financial statements continued The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods.
Accelerated Retirement tax Acquisition benefit depreciation intangibles obligations Losses Other Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2006 82 913 65 12 87 831 Charge credit to equity for the year 24 6 18 Credit charge to income statement continuing operations 15 69 15 32 32 5 Acquisition of subsidiary 37 116 24 129 Transfer 10 4 16 30 Transfer to discontinued operations 1 1 Exchange differences 10 97 3 104 At 31 December 2006 85 997 39 44 119 880 Charge credit to equity for the year 51 9 42 Charge credit to income statement continuing operations 20 53 19 7 43 42 Acquisition of subsidiary 7 40 3 44 Disposal of subsidiary 1 1 Exchange differences 3 11 1 1 4 12 At 31 December 2007 115 1,101 32 50 177 1,021 Other consists primarily of: short-term temporary differences of 94 million: deferred tax on restructuring provisions of 34 million: and deferred tax on share awards totalling 36 million.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for balance sheet purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax assets 124 170 Deferred tax liabilities 1,145 1,050 1,021 880 At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised of 179 million 2006: 187 million.
We do not believe that it is more likely than not that these amounts will be recoverable.
Tax losses of 20 million expire in 2008, 76 million expire between 2009 and 2020 and 1 million expire after 2020.
Other tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 7.8 billion 2006: 5.2 billion.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
