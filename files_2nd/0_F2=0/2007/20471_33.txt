Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities A Objectives.
policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk: The Group is involved in issuing motor insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its underwriting partners.
Insurance risk primarily involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount and timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
The key risk is that the frequency and or value of the claims arising exceeds expectation and the value of insurance liabilities established.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 18, it has delegated the task of supervising risk management to the RMC.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group.
These include underwriting partnership arrangements, pricing policies and claims management and administration policies.
A number of the key elements of these policies and procedures are detailed below: i Co-insurance and reinsurance: As noted in the underwriting structure section of the financial review above, the Group passes out a significant amount of the motor insurance business written to external underwriters.
In 2007, 60% of the risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the primary risk is borne by the co-insurer.
A further 17.5% was ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
ii Data driven pricing: The Groups underwriting philosophy is focused on a sophisticated data-driven approach to pricing and underwriting and on exploiting the competitive advantages direct insurers enjoy over traditional insurers through: Collating and analysing more comprehensive data from customers: Tight control over the pricing guidelines in order to target profitable business sectors: and Fast and flexible responsiveness to data analysis and market trends.
The Group is committed to establishing premium rates that appropriately price the underwriting risk and exposure.
Rates are set utilising a larger than average number of underwriting criteria.
The Directors believe that there is a strong link between the increase in depth of data that the Group has been able to collate over time and the lower than average historic reported loss ratios enjoyed by the Group.
Financial statements 43 - 94 76 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS iii Effective claims management: The Group adopts various claims management strategies designed to ensure that claims are paid at an appropriate level and to minimise the expenses associated with claims management.
These include: An effective, computerised workflow system which along with the appropriate level of resources employed helps reduce the scope for error and avoids significant backlogs : Use of an outbound telephone team to contact third parties aiming to minimise the potential claims costs and to ensure that more third parties utilise the Group approved repairers: Use of sophisticated and innovative methods to check for fraudulent claims.
Concentration of insurance risk: The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group only writes one line of insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base.
B Sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions: The following table sets out the impact on equity at 31 December 2007 that would result from a 1 per cent change in the loss ratios used for each underwriting year for which material amounts remain outstanding.
Underwriting year 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Total Loss ratio 56.0% 62.5% 74.0% 86.0% 89.0% Impact of 1% change 000s 1,214 1,552 2,017 1,822 529 7,134 The impact is stated net of reinsurance and includes the change in net insurance claims along with the associated profit commission movements that result from changes in loss ratios.
The figures are stated net of tax at the current rate.
