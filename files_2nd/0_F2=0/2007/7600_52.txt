SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Equity-settled share option plans Executive share options The Company operates an executive share option scheme which grants options to eligible employees.
Vesting of options granted is subject to the achievement of performance targets, as described in the Remuneration Committees Report, over a three year period.
Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.
Options are valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted to model the particular features of the options.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only relates to options granted after November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, are as follows: Date of grant 06.03.2007 08.03.2006 09.03.2005 31.03.2004 14.03.2003 Exercise price p 640.0 383.0 220.7 116.9 79.0 Share price at grant p 640.0 383.0 236.0 125.0 84.5 Expected volatility % pa 36 38 38 39 41 Dividend yield % pa 1.17 1.31 1.59 3.07 3.88 Risk-free interest rate % pa 4.9 4.3 4.9 4.6 3.9 Turnover rates % pa 5 5555 Fair value at grant p 248.4 149.8 91.0 44.0 28.0 Fair value adjusted for rights issue p n a n a 85.1 41.1 26.2 Assumed likelihood of satisfying performance condition at: 31 December 2006 n a 75% 75% 100% 100% 31 December 2007 75% 75% 75% 100% 100% The assumption for early exercise is 50% when options are 20% in the money.
