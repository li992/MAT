The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the group's financial statements in the period of initial adoption.
Adoption of IFRS 7 will require additional information on the group's financial instruments.
Adoption of IAS 1 will require additional disclosure relating to capital management.
There will be no impact on reported income or net assets from either adoption.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Segment information The group's primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
The group's business operations are divided into four core trading segments which are managed separately.
Pub Company covers the results of managed houses, Pub Partners covers the results of tenanted houses, Brewing Company covers brewing beer, marketing and selling, all predominantly in England.
Belhaven covers the results of our Scottish operation which includes managed and tenanted houses and brewing and selling beer.
Corporate includes central costs and central assets liabilities.
To aid comparability, the 2005 6 segmental figures have been adjusted to re-analyse the Ridley's business from Brewing Company to Pub Partners and Corporate in accordance with the 2006 7 treatment.
Results for the 34 weeks of trading of the acquired Hardys & Hansons business have been integrated into the Pub Company, Pub Partners and Brewing Company segments.
In 2006, the Belhaven results reflect 30 weeks of trading since acquisition.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm's length basis.
Geographical segments The group's assets and operations are predominantly located within the UK.
As the group has virtually only domestic activities, segment reporting is only required by business segment.

Share based payment plans The group operates four types of share-based payment arrangements: executive share option plans ESOS, a senior management longterm incentive plan LTIP, general employee share option plan SAYE and a share incentive plan SIP.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors' remuneration report on pages 66 to 70.
The total expense recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions is 4.8m 2006: 3.1m, all of which relates to equity-settled transactions.
The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2007 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 936 p 813 p 1150 p Exercise price - 813 p 865 p Expected dividend yield 2.1 % 2.1 % 2.1 % Risk-free rate of return 4.8 % 4.6 % 5.1 % Volatility 21.5 % 21.2 % 22.1 % Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 2006 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 705 p 657 p 765 p Exercise price - 660 p 585 p Expected dividend yield 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % Risk-free rate of return 4.2 % 4.2 % 4.1 % Volatility 17.4 % 17.0 % 17.1 % Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
The weighted average fair value of options and contingently issued shares granted during the period under the ESOS and SAYE schemes was 200p 2006: 110p and 374p 2006: 203p respectively, and under the LTIP scheme was 880p 2006: 647p.
The SIP shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
As such, this is their fair value and the assumptions stated above are not relevant for this scheme.

During the year a defined benefit pension obligation has been acquired as a result of the Hardys & Hansons acquisition.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs after employment.
The benefit is no longer given to new employees.

Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in the last four years: Greene King Pension Scheme closed 2 May 1997, last valued 5 April 2003, Morland Pension Scheme closed 12 December 2000, last valued 5 April 2003, Tolly Cobbold Pension Scheme closed 29 July 2002, last valued 1 December 2004, Belhaven Pension Scheme closed 31 October 2005, last valued 31 March 2005, and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme closed 1 July 2003, last valued 30 April 2004.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group's finances and are administered by pension trustees.
Pension benefits are related to members' final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of recognised income and expense.

The values of the schemes' liabilities have been determined by qualified actuaries based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, updated to 29 April 2007 using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.6% 5.2% Expected rates of salary increases 5.0% 4.8% Expected pension payment increases 3.1% 2.9% Rate of inflation 3.2% 3.0% Healthcare cost increase 9.0% 9.0% Mortality pre-retirement AM92 AF92 -3 AM92 AF92 -3 Mortality post-retirement members not yet at National retirement age PMA PFA92 c 2030 PMA PFA92 c 2030 Mortality post-retirement members past National retirement age PMA PFA92 c 2010 PMA PFA92 c 2010 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers' forecasts to each category of scheme asset.

It is estimated that this will result in a reduction in the deferred tax liability of approximately 13m in next year's financial statements.
The Government also announced a reduction in the rate of capital allowances from 25% to 20% and to 10% on fixtures and the phased abolition of industrial buildings and hotel allowances.
The changes to capital allowances will have no impact on the total tax charge in the financial statements.
We are currently unable to estimate the impact of the abolition of industrial buildings and hotel allowances as the legislation has not been published.

Goodwill m Cost At 2 May 2005 360.0 Acquired through business combinations note 18 145.1 At 30 April 2006 505.1 Acquired through business combinations note 18 102.6 At 29 April 2007 607.7 All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to business segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 180.8m 2006: 130.0m to Pub Company, 161.8m 2006: 118.9m to Pub Partners, 138.7m 2006: 129.8m to Brewing Company, and 126.4m 2006: 126.4m to Belhaven.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for all business segments are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% 2006: 9.0% and the projected cashflows beyond the one year budgets extrapolated using a growth rate in line with an expected long-term inflation rate of 2.0% 2006: 2.0%, which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.

A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.

The main fair value adjustments relate to the revaluation of the freehold properties acquired, recognition of related deferred tax liability on these revaluations and, in relation to Belhaven, the recognition of a defined benefit pension liability.
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review that was carried out by qualified surveyors employed by the company.
Retained properties have been revalued at their existing use value and properties subsequently disposed have been valued at their fair value less costs to sell.
The value of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
The fair values presented in the interim statements were provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the interim date.
The principal change is due to the subsequent disposal of a number of properties on 1 December 2006 which gave a better indication of their previous fair value.
The net cashflow impact of the acquisition was: 2007 2006 m m Cash paid 172.0 222.8 Net overdraft cash acquired 0.5 9.9 Net cash outflow 172.5 232.7 From the date of acquisition, Hardys & Hansons plc has contributed 12.2m operating profit to the group results.
As a result of integrating the Hardys & Hansons operations, it is no longer practical to identify the related cashflows for Hardys & Hansons separately.
Prior to acquisition the results of Hardys & Hansons were prepared under UK GAAP, using different accounting policies and bases, and therefore a proforma trading result has not been produced.

The group has facilities of 35.0m available with interest linked to base rate.
Bank loans - unsecured A new 5-year revolving credit facility was signed on 26 April 2007, giving the group a committed facility of 550.0m.
An amount of 235.0m was drawn down under this facility at the year-end and utilised to repay outstanding amounts under the group's previous revolving credit facilities, which were cancelled with effect from 27 April 2007, leaving 315.0m undrawn.
The amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payment on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although the individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the facility until April 2012 hence the related debt has been classified as non-current.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
The effective interest rate for 190.0m of the 235.0m drawn-down is 5.61% with the remaining 45.0m at a rate linked to LIBOR.
The fixed rate loan attracts interest at 6.775% and is payable annually.
The principal is repayable over the term of the loan by annual payments in accordance with the payment schedule.
Securitised debt On 7 March 2005, 600.0 million of bonds were issued in connection with the securitisation of 904 of the group's pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities and pay related issue costs.
On 8 May 2006, a further 550 million of bonds were issued as a tap of the original securitisation, involving an additional 801 of the group's pubs, held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities, pay related issue costs of 4.3m and early redemption of the debentures, incurring an accelerated interest cost of 0.7m, debenture redemption costs of 4.0m, and swap termination costs of 4.7m.

carrying value is net of related deferred finance fees.
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, within the date ranges shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, and A4 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
Due to disposal of a number of the securitised properties during the year there is 90.8m of cash held in secured accounts which can only be used for specified purposes by the securitisation vehicle.

Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and short term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group's operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group's financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk and credit risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group's borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cashflow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every 6 months.
Credit risk The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans, cash, and certain derivative instruments.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging At 29 April 2007, the group held 6 2006: 23 interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of 265.0m 2006: 497.5m, designated as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of 265.0m 2006: 497.5m of the group's variable rate borrowings excluding bonds, and are held on the balance sheet as a fair value asset of 3.5m 2006: liability of 5.1m.
The cashflows occur quarterly and semi-annually, receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or LIBOR, which ranged from 4.50% to 5.67% 2006: 4.50% to 4.95%, and paying a fixed rate ranging from 4.53% to 5.09% 2006: 4.40% to 6.96%.
Remaining contract maturity dates range from September 2007 to June 2011.
At 29 April 2007, the group also held 2 2006: 1 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 435.0m 2006: 150.0m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation tap.
A net fair value asset of 2.3m 2006: liability of 12.2m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 435.0m 2006: 150.0m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 4.947% 2006: 5.155%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cashflow hedges have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006 07 48 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 29 APRIL 2007 Interest rate risk The following tables set out the group's exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest bearing financial asset and financial liability.
The interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included in the above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Financial assets Financial assets relate to trade loans receivable.
Included in the fixed rate trade loan balance above is 14.1m 2006: 12.9m in relation to loans with settlement related to purchase levels and which therefore do not have a set repayment profile.
The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the write-down.
This is not necessarily the actual write-down that will occur.
The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 1.02% 2006 - 1.01% and a weighted average period of 6.23 years 2006 - 7.25 years.
Interest rates on variable trade loans are linked to base rate.
