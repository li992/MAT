Defined benefit plans Following the disposal of the hotels division in 2006, the Groups only significant retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK employees.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers are appointed to run it.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 1 July 2005.
A funding review, following the disposal of the hotels division, was carried out in 2006 and a further review was carried out in 2007.
The results of the actuarial valuations were updated to 31 December 2007 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost has been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19.
During 2007, the sale of the Vernons Pools business was announced.
Vernons Pools Limited is a participating employer in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and contributed 0.1 million during the year for those employees affected by the sale that have now ceased to participate in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The liabilities in respect of the affected individuals have been retained in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.

The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Equity instruments % 50.0 67.0 Debt instruments % 50.0 33.0 100.0 100.0 Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages where appropriate : 2007 2006 % % Discount rate 5.9 5.2 Expected return on plan assets 6.1 6.5 Future salary growth 6.2 5.9 Future pension increases LPI 5% 3.1 2.8 The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes.
The sources used to determine the best estimate of long-term returns include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
At 31 December 2007, the long-term expected rate of return on equity instruments, debt instruments and other assets was assumed to be 7.6 per cent pa, 4.6 per cent pa and 4.4 per cent pa, respectively, for the Plan.
The post retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard PA92 mortality table with medium cohort projection, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2007 is 85.0 years for males and 87.9 years for females.
For members with large pensions, a longer lifetime is assumed 88.6 for males and 91.7 for females.

For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for the year ended 31 December 2007, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items: 2007 m A 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.8 Decrease in the balance sheet asset as at 31 December 2007 18.4 This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value of the bond assets held by the Plan A 1.0% pa decrease in the expected return on Plan assets would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the amount charged to staff costs 2.2 A one year increase in life expectancy would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.1 Decrease in the balance sheet asset as at 31 December 2007 5.0 A 0.5% pa increase in price inflation would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.5 Decrease in the balance sheet asset as at 31 December 2007 10.2 Amounts for the current year and the prior three years are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 2004 UK Non-UK UK Non-UK Schemes Schemes Total Schemes Schemes Total m m m m m m m m Defined benefit obligation 208.5 208.1 401.3 99.5 500.8 332.7 86.5 419.2 Plan assets 242.1 230.7 293.9 63.4 357.3 236.9 53.7 290.6 Surplus deficit 33.6 22.6 107.4 36.1 143.5 95.8 32.8 128.6 Experience gain loss on plan liabilities 8.1 0.7 49.6 3.5 53.1 11.2 6.5 17.7 Experience loss gain on plan assets 3.0 8.9 34.0 0.2 34.2 7.7 0.4 7.3 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 91
