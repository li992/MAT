1 In 2007, only the acquisition of Sanitors Inc. accounted for more than 2% of the Groups revenue on an individual basis.
2 In accordance with IFRS 3 opening balances are only provisionally determined within the 12 months period from the acquisition date.
Fair value adjustments made in 2007 include adjustments relating to net assets from prior years acquisitions of DKK 3 million made within the 12 months period.
Furthermore, the purchase price of prior years acquisitions increased by DKK 21 million in 2007, mainly due to inclusion of an earn-out on the acquisition of Tempo Services Ltd. in 2006.
As a result goodwill increased by DKK 18 million in 2007 due to adjustments to prior years acquisitions.
3 The following intangibles are subsumed into goodwill: i assembled workforce, ii technical expertise and technological know how, iii training expertise and training and recruitment programmes and iv platform for growth.
As the Group is a service company that acquires businesses in order to apply the ISS model and generate value by restructuring and refining the acquired business, the main impact from acquisitions derives from synergies, the value of human resources and the creation of platforms for growth.
4 Acquisition costs, net of tax amounting to DKK 80 million related mainly to the acquisitions of Sanitors in the USA, Topman and Fealty in Taiwan, Hanyang in China, Carlos Rocha in Spain and Adviance in the United Kingdom.
