Notes to the financial statements 67 Notes to the financial statements e. Retirement benefit schemes The Redrow Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme comprises two sections: a funded, self-administered, defined benefits section and a funded defined contribution section, the former of which is contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme.
The total pension credit for the year was 2.5m 2006: charge of 6.9m 4.1m of which related to the defined benefit section of the scheme 2006: charge of 5.7m, with 1.7m being charged to the income statement 2006: 2.9m and 5.8m being credited to the statement of recognised income and expense 2006: charge of 2.8m.
The charge arising from the defined contribution section was 1.6m 2006: 1.2m.
Triennial valuation A full independent triennial actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was undertaken at 1 July 2005.
The method used was the Projected Unit Method.
The main assumptions were an investment return of 4.89% per annum compound, salary increase of 5.7% per annum compound, and mortality in accordance with the PA92 series of tables.
In the opinion of the Actuary, there was a deficit of 11.5m in the defined benefit section of the Scheme, with the value of the Schemes assets representing 78% of the Schemes liabilities.
As at 1 July 2005 the value of the defined benefit section of the Schemes assets was 41.5m.
The previous triennial valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2003 and reported a deficit of 2.2m.
The pension scheme year end was amended subsequent to 1 January 2003 to coincide with the Groups year end of 30 June.
Defined Benefit Scheme IAS 19 valuation Redrow has elected to adopt the December 2004 amendments to IAS 19 as encouraged by the IASB.
In particular, Redrow has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit plan in the period in which they occur, outside the income statement, in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
This disclosure relates to the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
The Schemes assets are held separately from the assets of Redrow and are administered by the trustees and managed professionally.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was carried out at 1 July 2005.
This valuation has been updated to 30 June 2007 by a qualified actuary for the purposes of these accounts.
Company contributions for the 12 months ending June 2008 are expected to be approximately 2.6m.
68 Notes to the financial statements The major financial assumptions used in arriving at the IAS 19 valuation were: 2007 2006 Long-term rate of increase in pensionable salaries 6.5% 6.1% 1 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 5% per annum and RPI 3.4% 3.0% 2 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 2.5% per annum and RPI 2.3% 2.2% Discount rate 5.9% 5.2% Inflation assumption 3.5% 3.1% Expected return on assets 7.1% 6.8% 1 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned prior to 30 June 2006 2 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned after 30 June 2006.
Other pension increases are valued in a consistent manner.
The expected return on assets assumption has been derived by considering the appropriate return for each of the main asset classes listed below.
The yields assumed on bond type investments are based on published redemption yields at the balance sheet date.
The assumed return on equities and property reflects an assumed allowance for the out-performance of these asset classes over UK Government bonds in the long term.
The rates of return are shown net of investment manager expenses.
The mortality tables used in the actuarial valuation were making allowance for projected further improvements in mortality : For male members: PMA92C2020 adjusted for projected further improvements in mortality For female members: PFA92C2020 adjusted for projected further improvements in mortality The life expectancies implied by these tables for typical members are: Pensioner currently aged 70: Male 15.6 years Female 18.4 years Future pensioner when aged 65: Male 19.8 years Female 22.8 years It has been assumed that all members will commute part of their pension in return for a tax free cash sum on retirement in accordance with pre-April 2006 limits.

It remains the Groups policy not to trade in financial instruments, nor does it permit any foreign currency transactions.
Interest rate and liquidity risk At 30 June 2007, the Group had total unsecured bank borrowing facilities of 440.0m, representing 400.0m committed facilities and 40.0m uncommitted facilities.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group may enter into interest rate swaps, options and forward rate agreements.
All interest rate exposures are sterling denominated.
The principal sums, draw down and maturity dates are arranged so as to match those of the borrowings to which the swaps relate.
The following table shows the profile of interest bearing debt together with its effective interest rates, after taking account of interest rate swaps as at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they will reprice: 2007 2006 Effective Total 0-1 1-2 2-5 Effective Total 0-1 1-2 2-5 interest year years years interest year years years rate rate % m m m m % m m m m Bank overdraft 6.5 20.1 20.1 - - 5.5 22.8 22.8 - - Bank loans - fixed rate 5.6 100.0 37.5 25.0 37.5 4.7 62.5 - 37.5 25.0 Bank loans - floating rate 6.4 70.0 - - 70.0 5.1 69.5 - - 69.5 190.1 57.6 25.0 107.5 154.8 22.8 37.5 94.5 76 Notes to the financial statements b.

c. Amounts due in respect of development land The Groups policy permits land purchases to be made on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39, the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value using the effective interest method.
The difference between the fair value and nominal value is amortised over the deferment period via financing costs, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The interest rate used for each deferred payment is an equivalent loan rate available on the date of the land purchase, as applicable to a loan lasting for a comparable period to that of the deferment.
The maturity profile of amounts due in respect of development land is as below: The Group 2007 2006 m m Due within one year 75.4 36.4 Due between one and two years 29.9 18.5 Due between two and five years 18.9 23.4 124.2 78.3 d. Credit risk The Groups credit risk is mainly attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position of its debtors.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of customers.
e. Fair values At 30 June 2007 there is no material difference between the fair value of financial instruments and their carrying values as shown in the balance sheet.

Due to development timescales, it is necessary to estimate costs to complete and future revenues and to allocate non unit specific development costs between units legally completing in the current financial year and in future periods.
