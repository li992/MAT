Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the financial statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Current investments the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments, carrying values approximate fair value.
Non-current investments excluding equity investments in joint ventures and associates the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
Loans the fair value of fixed rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given frequency of resets.
Forward foreign exchange contracts the Group has forward foreign exchange contracts to sell currency for the purpose of hedging non-dollar commercial transaction exposures which existed at the date of the balance sheet.
The majority of the contracts for existing transactions had a maturity of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based on market forward foreign exchange rates at year end.
Foreign currency option contracts the Group may use foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, non-dollar commercial transactions.
The fair value of option contracts is estimated using Black-Scholes valuation techniques.
Interest rate swaps the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, in accordance with a formal risk management strategy.
The fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.

Liquidity risk The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows: Trade, other Bank overdrafts payables and and other loans Bonds provisions Total $m $m $m $m Within one year 4,305 619 7,355 12,279 In one to two years 1,259 715 1,974 In two to three years 1,679 1,679 In three to four years 532 532 In four to five years 2,255 2,255 In more than five years 13,356 13,356 4,305 19,700 8,070 32,075 Effect of interest 25 8,857 8,882 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 33 33 31 December 2007 4,280 10,876 8,070 23,226 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 140 ASTRAZENECA ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F INFORMATION 2007 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Market risk Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2007 and at 31 December 2006 are set out below.
In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
2007 2006 Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate $m $m $m $m $m $m Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings Current 4,280 4,280 136 136 Non-current 10,876 7,594 3,282 1,087 1,087 15,156 7,594 7,562 1,223 1,223 Financial assets Fixed deposits 60 60 559 559 Cash and cash equivalents 5,867 5,867 7,103 7,103 5,927 5,927 7,662 7,662 In addition to the financial assets above, there are $6,272m 2006 $5,011m of other current and non-current asset investments and other financial assets on which no interest is received.
Foreign currency risk Transactional exposure 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group companies concerned, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used to match foreign currency exposures.
Translational exposure During the year there was no significant change in our risk position in relation to the cash flows of the Groups principal six currency exposures sterling, Swedish krona, euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
During the year, foreign currency loans have been designated as hedges on retranslation of net investments in foreign operations.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2007, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2007, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $75m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2007, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.

Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
