Share options Share options At 31 March 2007 unexercised options over 1,956,070 2006: 3,655,510 new ordinary 1p shares in the Company and 3,964,695 2006: 6,234,695 purchased ordinary 1p shares held by the ESOP had been granted to directors and employees under the Companys share option schemes.
During the period no new options were granted.
Options over 1,699,440 new ordinary 1p shares and 2,270,000 purchased ordinary 1p shares were exercised.
In order that the dilutive effect of issuing new shares be reduced, and to reduce the number of shares required by the ESOP to satisfy share awards, the Company agreed with employees that the number of shares required on the exercise of options be reduced.
To ensure that employees were not disadvantaged by this reduction, the exercise prices applied on the exercise of the options were correspondingly reduced.
The effect of the reductions to the exercise prices was to reduce the weighted average exercise price from 105p to 3p.
These reductions in exercise prices were not applied to options exercised in accordance with the Helical Bar 1999 Approved Share Option Scheme.
