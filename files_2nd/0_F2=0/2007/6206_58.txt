These financial statements were filed subsequent to the declaration of a dividend, therefore legally the payment to shareholders did not constitute a dividend but rather was deemed to be a distribution.
A resolution to redesignate the 2005 distribution as a dividend was approved at the annual general meeting of the Company on 17 May 2006. b The Foseco Employee Benefit trust makes regular purchases of the Company's shares to satisfy the vesting of Ltip awards.
c The Company purchased and subsequently cancelled 2,685,000 of its ordinary shares with a nominal value of 671,250 for a total consideration of 5,792,284, including transaction costs of 57,509.
