These are calculated as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Profit from operations 59,006 53,947 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 3,915 3,562 Headline operating profit 62,921 57,509 Profit before tax 56,598 55,012 Loss profit on fair value movements on derivatives 556 3,659 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 3,915 3,562 Headline profit before tax 61,069 54,915 Cash generated by operations see note 26 66,249 66,414 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 8,569 4,759 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment - 34 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 5,489 4,676 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares - 513 Operating cash flow 52,191 56,500 Headline operating profit has been shown before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, which relates to acquired intellectual property, customer relationships and profit in acquired order book.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, this charge has been excluded from headline operating profit.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 are also presented before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
Ultra is therefore stating headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the headline operating performance of the Group can more clearly be seen.
The Group is cash generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure in property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an understatement of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.
3 Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Sales of goods 211,039 206,210 Revenue from long term contracts 201,851 170,830 412,890 377,040 4 Other operating income Amounts included in other operating income were as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Foreign exchange gains 5,050 1,505 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 51 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 5 Other operating expenses Amounts included in other operating expenses were as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Amortisation of development costs 949 2,234 Foreign exchange losses 43 753 992 2,987 Amortisation of development costs has previously been included within administrative expenses.

Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 55 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Intangible assets continued Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Customer relationships 3 to 10 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years During the year a reduction of 292,000 was made to the value of goodwill held in respect of Audiopack.
This was due to a successful claim made against certain warranties included in the Sale and Purchase Agreement, which resulted in a refund of 292,000 of the consideration.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 DF Group 35,375 35,375 Radamec 5,267 5,267 SML 5,495 5,495 UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc. 14,172 14,172 Tactical Communication Systems 19,305 19,305 DNE Technologies 13,869 14,106 Ocean Systems 5,321 5,321 Criticom 5,465 - BCF Designs 5,335 - Other comprising several CGUs 19,206 17,235 128,810 116,276 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to both selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of nil per cent.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.2%.
An impairment review of goodwill at 31 December 2007 has been performed and the Directors consider that no adjustment is required.
Acquisitions during the year In aggregate, consideration of 31,016,000 was paid in respect of acquisitions, all of which was discharged by means of cash and cash equivalents and was made up as follows: 000 Cash outflow on subsidiaries acquired in current year 31,195 Deferred consideration on subsidiaries acquired in prior year 200 Cash acquired with subsidiaries 379 Net cash outflow 31,016 Aggregate assets and liabilities acquired comprised intangible assets of 17,157,000, property, plant and equipment of 288,000, cash of 379,000, inventories of 1,014,000, receivables of 4,103,000 and current liabilities of 3,096,000.

The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate to customer relationships, intellectual property rights and the estimated profit in the acquired order book, the fair value of which is dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future profits resulting from the access to new markets for the Groups existing products.

Telemus Inc. On 1 July 2007, the Group, through a subsidiary, purchased all of the share capital of Telemus Inc. a Company based in Ontario, Canada, for a cash consideration of 282,000.
Goodwill arising on acquisition amounted to 79,000.
If the above acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been 424.0 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been 43.1 million.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was 32,000 2006: 56,000.

The average credit period on sale of goods is 37 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 21 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
At 31 December 2007, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately 1,935,000 2006: asset of 2,491,000, comprising 5,373,000 assets 2006: 4,105,000 included in trade and other receivables and 3,438,000 liabilities 2006: 1,614,000 included in trade and other payables.
The loss on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 556,000 2006: gain of 3,659,000.
62 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 21 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales purchase contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.
The associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external borrowings in US and Canadian dollars.
The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps will mature over the next year and have fixed swap rates ranging from 4.56 per cent to 5.19 per cent.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
The nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps are US$20 million 2006: US$30 million and CAD$30 million 2006: CAD$30 million.
The interest rate swaps are designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value has been charged to equity.
At 31 December 2007, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 55,000 2006: assets of 54,000, comprising 10,000 of assets 2006: 67,000 included in trade and other receivables and 65,000 of liabilities 2006: 13,000 included in trade and other payables.
The amount recycled into the income statement during the year was 154,000 2006: 28,000 and has been credited against interest cost in the period.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next year 2006: two years.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 2007 Cash and cash equivalents 4.05% 27,419 27,419 - - Unsecured bank loans: GBP loan 6.20% 16,295 - - 16,295 US dollar loan 5.24% 10,046 - - 10,046 Canadian dollar loan 4.61% 15,267 - - 15,267 Finance lease liabilities 4.25% 54 25 29 - 2006 Cash and cash equivalents 3.81% 25,628 25,628 - - Unsecured bank loans: GBP loan 5.16% 2,724 - - 2,724 US dollar loan 5.19% 15,330 - - 15,330 Canadian dollar loan 4.51% 14,668 - - 14,668 Finance lease liabilities 4.25% 70 22 48 - Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 63 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 21 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value 2007 2007 2006 2006 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 27,419 27,419 25,628 25,628 Interest rate swaps 55 55 54 54 Foreign exchange contracts 1,935 1,935 2,491 2,491 Unsecured bank loans 41,608 41,608 32,722 32,722 Finance lease liabilities 54 54 70 70 Forward exchange contracts are marked-to-market using listed market prices.

Share Options During the year to 31 December 2007, the Group operated the following equity-settled share option schemes: 1.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes A Savings Related Share Option Scheme is open to all US employees and provides for a purchase price equal to the average of the daily average market price on the five days before the grant less 10%.
The vesting period is two years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of three months from the date of maturity, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
A Savings Related Share Option Scheme is open to all Canadian employees and provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the day before the grant less 10%.
The vesting period is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of maturity, the options expire.
A Savings Related Share Option Scheme is open to all UK employees and provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the day before grant less 10%.

At 31 December 2007, share options outstanding under the Savings Related Share Option Schemes were as follows: Number of shares Option Exercise Options granted 2007 2006 price dates 2006 Canadian scheme 34,481 42,018 9.21 September 2009 - March 2010 2007 US scheme 81,883 - 10.34 September 2009 - December 2009 2007 UK 3 year scheme 78,729 - 10.39 December 2010 - June 2011 2007 UK 5 year scheme 132,453 - 10.39 December 2012 - June 2013 2.
Company Share Option Plan The Company Share Option Plan provides share options for nominated employees in the UK.
The purchase price is set at a mid-market price on the date of grant.
This is an approved scheme.
From 2000 vesting has been unconditional.
Options vest after three years and lapse after ten years from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Share Option Scheme provides share options for nominated employees in the UK, US and Canada.
This is an unapproved scheme.
Options vest after three years and lapse after seven years from the date of grant.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Details in relation to the LTIP are included in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 42 and 43.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share options for all share based payment arangements including LTIP are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average exercise Number exercise Number price of options price of options 2007 2007 2006 2006 Beginning of year 4.76 1,605,237 3.83 1,879,847 Granted during the year 9.05 577,120 7.09 346,477 Forfeited during the year 3.49 43,388 5.98 90,268 Expired during the year 0.36 52,208 0.00 101,679 Exercised during the year 4.10 461,429 3.44 429,140 Outstanding at the end of the year 6.65 1,625,332 4.76 1,605,237 Exercisable at the end of the year 4.89 397,006 4.40 401,945 The Group recognised total expenses of 1,186,000 2006: 648,000 in relation to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 11.79.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 1,993,343 2006: 1,266,482.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2007 LTIP is measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP Weighted average share price 11.79 8.79 8.46 7.06 Weighted average exercise price 9.9 8.66 8.37 n a Expected volatility % 21.0 20.0 19.2 18.9 Expected option life years 3.56 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk free interest rate % 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.4 Expected dividends % 1.6 1.8 1.8 1.9 Figures in the above table show an average across similar schemes.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 67 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 24 Share capital and share options continued As outlined in the Directors Remuneration report, the Directors intend, subject to shareholder approval, to change the methodology for all awards made under the new 2007 LTIP and replace the relative EPS based performance condition with a relative total shareholder return TSR condition.
For the 2007 LTIP award, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the award as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
Assumptions used in the valuation model were as follows: Exercise price 0.0 Share price at grant 11.52 Expected option life years 3.0 Expected volatility % 22.3 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 Risk free interest rate % 5.52 The Directors also intend, subject to shareholder approval, to change the performance condition for all outstanding awards under the old 2002-2007 LTIP 2005 and 2006 awards to a relative TSR condition.
In accordance with IFRS 2, this change to a market based performance condition has resulted in an additional fair value share options charge of 187,000 during 2007 in respect of these outstanding awards.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 4.45 2006: 3.66.

The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 2,563,000 2006: 2,125,000.
Defined benefit schemes The UK defined benefit scheme was actuarially assessed at 31 December 2007 using the projected unit method.
The Canadian defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2007 using the projected unit method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada UK Canada 2007 2007 2006 2006 Discount rate 5.8% 5.8% 5.2% 5.1% Inflation rate 3.25% 3.25% 2.9% 3.0% Expected rate of salary increases 4.5% 4.5% 4.15% 4.25% Future pension increases 3.0% 3.0% 2.65% 2.75% For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.25% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.5% and a 0.1% reduction in the discount rate to 5.7% would increase the schemes liabilities by 5.3% and 2.2% respectively.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
There is evidence to suggest that mortality rates are continuing to improve, meaning that people are living longer, with the result that pensions will be payable for a longer period.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables namely: Current pensioners 92 Series tables with medium cohort projections Future pensioners 92 Series tables with medium cohort projections The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2007 2006 2005 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 18 years 18 years Current pensioners at 65 females 25 years 21 years 21 years Future pensioners at 65 males 23 years 20 years 20 years Future pensioners at 65 females 26 years 23 years 23 years 70 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Total UK Canada Total 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 m m m m m m Current service cost 6.3 0.2 6.5 5.9 0.2 6.1 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 7.9 0.3 8.2 6.7 0.3 7.0 Expected return on pension scheme assets 8.1 0.4 8.5 6.8 0.3 7.1 6.1 0.1 6.2 5.8 0.2 6.0 Of the current service cost for the year, 4.0 million 2006: 3.6 million has been included in cost of sales, and 2.5 million 2006: 2.5 million has been included in administrative expenses.
