8 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trusteeadministered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for pensions as defined benefits, in accordance with FRS 17.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Company accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, principally post-retirement healthcare, in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2006.
This has been rolled forward to 31 July 2007.
Contributions to the funded scheme are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% 3.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1% 2.7% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.1% 2.8% Discount rate 5.8% 5.3% Inflation rate 3.1% 2.8% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the PA92 birth tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort.
The assumptions are that a member who retires next year at age 65 will live on average for a further 21 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time they are assumed to live on average for a further 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25 years after retirement if they are female.

The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.
The effect of retirement benefits calculated in accordance with FRS 17 is included in the financial statements as follows: Analysis of amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses 2007 2006 2005 m m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 52.6 23.5 As a percentage of scheme assets 3% 2% Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 36.7 1.6 1.9 As a percentage of present value scheme liabilities 2 % 0% 5% Changes in present value of defined benefit obligations 2007 2006 m m At beginning of the period 1,464.1 38.3 Transfers into scheme 1,406.2 Current service cost 20.5 15.7 Past service cost 1.1 Interest on obligations 76.1 40.2 Contributions by employees 0.1 0.8 Actuarial loss gain on liabilities 23.6 7.3 Curtailment gain 32.5 Benefits paid 60.2 29.8 At end of the period 1,492.8 1,464.1 Changes in present value of scheme assets 2007 2006 m m At beginning of the period 1,380.4 Transfers into scheme 1,285.1 Expected return on assets 96.5 49.2 Contributions by employer 60.0 51.6 Contributions by employees 0.1 0.8 Actuarial gain on assets 50.7 23.5 Benefits paid 60.2 29.8 At end of the period 1,527.5 1,380.4 Smiths Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 101 Notes to the Company accounts continued 8 Post-retirement benefits continued Cash contributions Cash payments in 2008 are expected to be 40.3m.
