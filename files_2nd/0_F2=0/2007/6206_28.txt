Given the inherent difficulty of estimating the cost of remediation, the directors have taken expert advice concerning these liabilities.
The provision is expected to be utilised within five years and has been discounted to its present value.
Unwinding of the discount does not appear in the table above due to its immateriality.
Other provisions Other provisions include amounts for staff benefits and holiday pay, and amounts to cover potential claims for various sales and social taxes.
These provisions are expected to be utilised within three years.
