47 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued I intangibles amortisation estimated remaining useful lives are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of intangibles are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the Directors best estimates of future income from customer contracts and is therefore subjective: I dilapidations provisions liabilities in respect of obligations to restore premises to their original condition are estimated at the commencement of the lease and are reviewed every six months.
The actual cost of these may be different depending upon whether the Group renews the lease: I onerous lease provisions liabilities in respect of onerous leases are reviewed and updated, where necessary, to reflect current conditions and intentions.
The actual cost of these may be different depending upon whether the Group is successful in assigning the lease: I deferred taxation full provision is made for deferred taxation, as required under IAS 12, Income taxes, at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless different future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered: and I derivatives IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specic hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity at future dates.
The Group generally bases its forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of the curve.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are therefore subjective.
Segmental information a Primary reporting format geographic segments At 31 December 2007, the Group is organised into two main geographic segments: the United Kingdom UK and Ireland and the Rest of Europe.

Following the change in the corporation tax rate announced in the 2007 budget, the UK element of the deferred tax asset at 31 December 2007 has been calculated using a tax rate of 28%.
Previous periods deferred tax assets have been calculated using a UK tax rate of 30%.
Part of the deferred tax asset has been used to offset deferred tax liabilities arising from claimed capital allowances and on the recognition of the intangible xed assets relating to customer contracts.
Such offsetting has only been applied when the deferred tax asset and liability arise in the same tax jurisdiction, the amounts are expect to reverse in similar periods and the amounts would be available for offset.
The gross amounts that have been offset are shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 29,901 41,601 Deferred tax assets 29,901 41,601 The Group expects to be able to offset any future taxable profits against brought forward trading losses.
Loss per share basic and diluted Basic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
At the year end the Group had the following contracts outstanding: Nominal value 000 Maturity date 53,000 30 September 2009 4,000 30 September 2010 2,950 30 September 2010 The xed interest payments are at an average rate of 5.24% and have floating rate interest receipts at LIBOR.
The nominal value of the interest rate swaps exceed the year end borrowings due to the higher than expected proportion of primary, when compared to secondary, proceeds from the Initial Public Offering.
Due to the capital projects that the Group has planned it is expected that the borrowings will exceed the nominal value of the interest rate swaps in the near future.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is shown below.
The fair value is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The interest rate swaps fair value movement was recorded in the income statement note 5.

The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers, which are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations.
Any impairment is assessed on a customer by customer basis following a detailed review of the particular circumstances.
To the extent they have not been specically provided against, the trade debtors are considered to be of sound credit rating.

Interest on the loan is charged at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.8% to 1.6% 2006: 2.3% to 3.3%.
Capitalised and unamortised loan arrangement fees of 1,420,000 2006: 1,925,000 are offset against the principal debt outstanding.

It is expected that this provision will be settled in approximately equal annual amounts over a period of nine years.
The provision for the closure of sites relates to the amount estimated to cover the costs of closing redundant sites.
The Directors consider the carrying values of the provisions to approximate to their fair values as they have been discounted at an appropriate rate.

On 19 October 2007, the shareholders of the Company passed resolutions to subdivide and reclassify each of the classes of issued share capital to Ordinary shares of 0.002.
The shares in issue at that time along with the number of Ordinary shares into which they were converted is shown below: Number of Number of previous class Ordinary of shares shares 000 000 Class of share A 10,000 50,000 B 10,000 50,000 C 11,292 56,459 E 1,166 3,166 F 475 1,488 161,113 In connection with the Companys flotation, 34,177,000 shares were issued for total consideration of 75,190,000.
Share issue costs of 5,390,000 have been charged to the share premium account, which when added to the share issue costs charged to the income statement of 2,877,000 result in net cash proceeds from the IPO of 66,923,000.
At the same time 2,802,000 shares were issued to the Telecity Group Employee benefit Trust EBT in order to satisfy some of the Groups liabilities to employees for share options issued under longterm incentive plans.
The shares were issued for 4,447,000 and the consideration remains on a loan account, which is expected to be repaid as the options are exercised.
In addition, on 24 April 2007, following an amendment to the Companys authorised share capital, the Company issued 475,000 F shares for cash consideration of 119,000.
As shown in the table above, these shares were subsequently converted into 1,488,000 Ordinary shares.
This takes the total net proceeds from share issues in the year to 67,042,000.
The Company, in accordance with its articles of association and the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1985, as amended the Act, has acquired for nil consideration 3,568,492 deferred shares of 0.2p each in the capital of the Company the Deferred shares issued at the time of admission to the London Stock Exchange.

The Deferred shares carried no voting rights.
Pursuant to Sections 146 2 a and 147 of the Act, the Company has cancelled the Deferred shares acquired and diminished the amount of its issued share capital by the nominal value of the Deferred shares cancelled.

Capital commitments Capital expenditure that had been contracted for but not provided for in the financial statements at 31 December 2007 amounted to 31,505,000 2006: 596,000.
Contingent liabilities Financial guarantees granted by the Groups banks in respect of operating leases amount to 6,946,000 at 31 December 2007 2006: 6,512,000.
At 31 December 2007 the estimated discounted cost of reinstating leasehold properties at the end of leases in accordance with the lease contracts amounted to 5,681,000 2006: 4,871,000.
The leases expire over a range of 2 to 20 years.
In accordance with the Group accounting policy, no amount has been provided in the financial statements as it is not considered probable that such liabilities will be incurred, as the Group expects to exercise its right to renew its leases when they expire and continue to use them as data centres.
Sharebased payments Under the Groups longterm incentive schemes, share options are granted to senior management.
In addition the Group operates a sharesave scheme which is available to all staff.
The details of the share option schemes are contained in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The following options, including those in respect of the sharesave scheme, were outstanding at the year end: 2007 2006 Average Average exercise Number exercise Number price per of share price per of share share options share options 000 000 At 1 January 0.78 684 Granted 1.93 2,391 0.78 684 At 31 December 1.68 3,075 0.78 684 Restated following the capital restructuring described in the note 20.
Options granted during the year were valued using the Black Scholes optionpricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: October October 2007 2007 July May Grant date Sharesave Options 2007 2007 Share price 2.62 2.20 0.78 0.78 Exercise price 2.90 2.20 0.78 0.78 Expected volatility 26.5% 26.5% 26.5% 100% Expected life years 3.0 2.5 1.2 3.3 Risk free rate 5.5% 5.5% 5.5% 5.5% Expected dividend yield nil nil nil nil Fair value per option 0.55 0.50 0.07 0.52 Restated following the capital restructuring described in the note 20.
Due to the lack of a track record, the expected volatility was determined by reference to the share price volatility experienced by other companies in the same sector and the Software and Computer Services sector as a whole.
The expected life is calculated on the assumption that employees will exercise the option shortly after vesting.
The charge arising from sharebased payments is disclosed in note 3.

61 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 annual general meeting The Companys Annual General Meeting will be held at the ofces of Addleshaw Goddard LLP, 150 Aldersgate Street, London EC1A 4EJ at 2.00pm on Thursday 15 May 2008.
All shareholders are welcome to attend and there will be an opportunity for shareholders to speak with Directors at the meeting.
The Notice of Meeting follows and sets out the business to be transacted.
An explanation of each of the resolutions follows below.
To receive and adopt the Directors Report and accounts This is an Ordinary Resolution to adopt the Directors Report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2007.
To approve the Directors Remuneration Report This is an Ordinary Resolution to approve the Directors Remuneration Report included in the Directors Report and accounts.
To reappoint Simon Batey as a Director This is an Ordinary Resolution to reappoint as a Director Simon Batey, who has been appointed by the Board since the last general meeting of the Company, and who accordingly retires and is being proposed for reappointment by shareholders in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
Biographical details of Simon Batey are included on page 22.
To reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors This is an Ordinary Resolution to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors and, as is customary, to authorise the Directors to x the auditors remuneration.
To authorise the Directors to allot relevant securities This is an Ordinary Resolution to renew the existing authority of the Directors to allot relevant securities within the meaning of the Companys Articles of Association up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of 132,061, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 7 March 2008.
Unless renewed, this authority would expire no later than 15 August 2009.
As some shareholders will be aware, it is normal for a UKListed company to maintain such an authority irrespective of any intention to exercise it.
The Board confirms that it does not currently have any intention to utilise this authority.
As at 7 March 2008, no shares were held by the Company as treasury shares.
To disapply preemption rights This is a Special Resolution to renew the existing authority of the Directors to allot equity securities within the meaning of the Companys Articles of Association for cash and or to sell treasury shares for cash without first offering such shares to existing shareholders on a pro rata basis, such authority to relate to a the allotment of shares in a rights issue or other offer where subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Board may deem necessary or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements or any legal, regulatory or practical problems in any territory or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange the shares attributable to holders of Ordinary shares are proportionate as nearly as practicable to their respective holdings of Ordinary shares and b the allotment of Ordinary shares having a maximum aggregate nominal value of 19,809, representing approximately 5% of the Companys issued Ordinary share capital as at 7 March 2008.
Unless renewed, the authority would expire no later than 15 August 2009.
Again, as some shareholders will be aware, it is normal for a UKListed company to maintain such an authority irrespective of any intention to exercise it.
To authorise the Company to repurchase its own shares This is a Special Resolution to renew the Directors existing authority to make market purchases of the Companys Ordinary shares, such authority to be limited to purchases of up to 19,809,237 shares representing approximately 10% of the Companys issued share capital as at 7 March 2008.
Any shares purchased under this authority may either be cancelled or held as treasury shares.
As with the previous two resolutions, it is normal for a UKListed company to maintain such an authority irrespective of any intention to exercise it.
In addition, this authority would only be utilised if such is expected to result in an increase in earnings per share and to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
As at 7 March 2008 there were options outstanding to subscribe for 3,066,070 Ordinary shares in the Company although in practice it is intended that exercise of these options will be principally satisfied by the transfer of shares from the Companys employee benefit trust, rather than by the allotment of new shares.
This represents approximately 1.5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 7 March 2008 and would represent approximately 1.9% of the issued share capital if both the Directors existing authority to buy back shares and the new authority now being sought were to be utilised in full.
To amend the Articles of Association It is proposed that new Articles of Association be adopted, incorporating a small number of amendments from the Companys existing Articles of Association in order to reflect the ongoing implementation of the Companies Act 2006, such adoption to take effect from 1 October 2008 the date upon which Section 175 of the 2006 Act is to come into force.
The principal amendment is the new Article, inserted as a result of the provisions of Section 175 which place upon a Director a statutory duty to avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Companys interests.
The new Article empowers the Directors, as permitted by Section 175, to authorise such a situation.
Any such authorisation will be effective only if the interested Director s is are not counted in the quorum for the Directors meeting at which the matter is considered and the vote s if any of such Director s on any such authorisation will be ignored.
The Directors may impose conditions or limitations on any such authorisation.
A small number of essentially consequential amendments are being made to related Articles dealing with the Directors interests.
62 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 annual general meeting continued 8.
To amend the Articles of Association continued Other amendments relate to the removal of references to extraordinary general meetings which terminology is not reflected in the 2006 Act : the removal of the Chairmans casting vote on any Ordinary Resolution at a general meeting: the incorporation of wording to reflect the provisions of the 2006 Act allowing nonworking days to be taken into account when calculating the maximum 48hour period prior to a general meeting for setting the deadline for receipt of proxies: and the removal of certain provisions regarding the appointment by corporate shareholders of multiple corporate representatives for the purposes of a general meeting of the Company which provisions, although consistent with the 2006 Act, are liable to cause difficulties in practice.
Recommendation Your Directors consider each of the resolutions set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
Accordingly, they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of such resolutions, as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.
