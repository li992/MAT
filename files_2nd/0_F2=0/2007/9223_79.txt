The latest formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 1 July 2005.
A funding review, following the disposal of the hotels division, was carried out in 2006 and a further review was carried out in 2007.
The latest funding review was updated to 31 December 2007 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the plan.
The table also sets out as at 31 December 2005, 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus or deficit of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability or asset and the net pension asset or liability.

In 2006, employers paid 123.1 million that included a special contribution of 111.0 million, half of which was paid by the Company and half of which was paid by Hilton Hotels Corporation.
During 2007, the sale of the Vernons Pools business was announced.
Vernons Pools Limited is a participating employer in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and contributed 0.1 million during the year for those employees affected by the sale that have now ceased to participate in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The liabilities in respect of the affected individuals have been retained in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 24.5 per cent of pensionable payroll, leading to an expected contribution of 6.0 million in 2008.
As the Plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age of the membership increases.
