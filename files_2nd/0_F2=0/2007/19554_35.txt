From continuing operations Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 m m Reported profit before income tax 85.9 84.4 Adjustments: Amortisation of intangibles excluding software and impairment of goodwill and available-for-sale investments 5.1 1.8 Share-based payment adjustment 4.8 6.1 Profit on disposal of subsidiary, associate, joint ventures and available-for-sale investments 0.7 5.1 Underlying profit before tax 85.5 75.0 The Directors regard the above adjustments necessary to give a fair picture of the underlying results of the Group for the period.
The adjustment for share based payment relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the value of the annual share award.
