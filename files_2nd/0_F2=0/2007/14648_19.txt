Notes to the parent Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified for measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight line basis from the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off all other assets over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold properties Over the lease period Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at net present value.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over their useful life.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
102 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 103 Trade and other debtors Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange profits and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The Companys policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
102 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 103 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
In relation to cash flow hedges forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
When the firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions The Company operates two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of employees.
These plans require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Other plans are defined contribution in nature.
The assets of the defined benefit plans are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of the plans are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The discount rate used to measure the plans liabilities is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
The extent to which the plans assets exceed or fall short of the plans liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the balance sheet net of deferred tax.
The regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees in defined benefit plans is charged to operating profit in the year together with the cost of providing benefit improvements in respect of past service and gains or losses arising on settlements and curtailments.
A credit for the expected return on the plans assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value of the plans liabilities because the benefits are one year closer to settlement, are included in other finance income or expense in the profit and loss account.
Differences arising between the actual and expected returns on the plans assets together with changes in the actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions payable to the other defined contribution plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the year for which they are due.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
104 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 105 Employee benefits When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a correponding adjustment to reserves.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result in a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain options to employees.
Shares are held by the employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Employees Please refer to the Report on directors remuneration on pages 33 to 42 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share options and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.

Pensions Defined benefit plans The defined benefit plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
These plans have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures.
The most recent actuarial valuation, at 1 April 2006, of the plans assets and the present value of the defined benefit plans obligations, using the projected unit credit method, have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.
i The key financial assumptions used were: 2007 2006 2005 % % % Inflation 3.4 3.1 2.9 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.1 3.8 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.5 3.5 Rate of increase for pensions in payment post 2001 pre April 2005 service 3.4 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase for pensions post April 2005 service 2.4 2.3 2.1 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.4 3.1 2.9 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 5.7 5.2 4.7 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on pension fund assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans as at 31 December 2007.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.6 years if they are male and for a further 24.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2027 aged 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.8 years 2006 22.1 years after retirement if they are male and a further 25 years 2006 24.3 years after retirement if they are female.
ii The assets and the liabilities in the plans were as follows: Long term Long term Long term rate of return rate of return rate of return expected 2007 expected 2006 expected 2005 % million % million % million Equities 8.0 48.0 8.0 65.9 7.6 77.2 Government bonds 4.5 64.3 4.5 67.7 4.1 22.1 Corporate bonds 4.7 13.0 5.0 11.3 4.5 13.4 Property 7.0 5.8 7.0 6.3 6.6 5.5 Cash and other 5.9 11.7 5.6 9.4 5.1 10.6 Fair value of plans assets 5.9 142.8 6.1 160.6 6.4 128.8 Present value of funded obligations 135.1 158.2 179.6 Surplus deficit in the plans 7.7 2.4 50.8 Surplus restriction 4.7 Surplus deficit recognised 3.0 2.4 50.8 Present value of unfunded obligations 0.7 0.7 0.7 Pension asset liability on the balance sheet 2.3 1.7 51.5 Deferred tax liability 0.8 Net pension asset liability on the balance sheet 1.5 1.7 51.5 106 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 107 The recognition of the surplus is restricted in 2007 to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
As a result only 3.0 million of the 7.7 million surplus has been recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2007.
At 31 December 2006 the surplus was below the present value of any economic benefits available and therefore a restriction did not apply.
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirents own financial instruments.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Company is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Companys statement of recognised gains and losses before 1 January 2003.
Expected cash contributions for 2008 for these schemes are 0.3 million.
The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs tax-exempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HM Revenue & Customs statutory earnings cap, have had their benefits increased through unapproved, unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2007 of 0.7 million 2006 0.7 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation.
Defined contribution schemes United Kingdom The Company maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom.
Employer contributions into these plans for 2007 were 0.7 million 2006 0.4 million.

Description of employee share plans a 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS see c below.
The EIP is currently available for selected employees including executive directors on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS and any awards will be subject to prior satisfactory individual performance.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights SARs and performance shares under the EIP.
114 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 115 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 16.
Capital and reserves continued In normal circumstances, options or SARs under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys EPS growth targets after excluding inflation have been met over a three year performance period.
The growth targets in respect of the initial award require that the Companys EPS increases within a range of 6 per cent per annum for 25 per cent vesting and 15 per cent per annum for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
In normal circumstances, performance shares under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys total shareholder return TSR targets have been met over a three year performance period.
The performance conditions require Spirents TSR to be above the median of a comparator group for 30 per cent vesting and in the upper quartile of a comparator group for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
The comparator group consists of the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those TechMARK companies who are also constituents of the FTSE100 Index at the commencement of the performance period.
All EIP awards will be tested once on or shortly following the third anniversary of grant.
Any part of an award which does not vest shall lapse ie there is no opportunity for retesting.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary shares.
This SARs approach will help the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded.
Using a SARs based approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed.
b Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined annually by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2007, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Companys 2008 Annual General Meeting.
The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is 0.3 per cent of the issued Ordinary share capital for both the SSIP and EIP see a above in aggregate.
Awards made pursuant to the SSIP normally vest over four years, provided that the employee remains in employment.
Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
c 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed however outstanding options may still be exercised and has been replaced by the EIP referred to in a above.
Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
116 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 117 The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS are subject to the achievement of an earnings per share EPS performance condition before they can be exercised.
The condition is that over a period of three consecutive financial years, there has been an increase in the Companys adjusted EPS which is at least 6 per cent more than the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
The performance condition is tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if it has not been met at that time, at each subsequent anniversary of grant until the option expires ie on the tenth anniversary of grant in normal circumstances.
All ESOS grants made after 11 May 2000 to executive directors are subject to an enhanced performance condition.
The performance condition requires the Companys adjusted EPS to increase over a period of three consecutive financial years within a range of 9 per cent minimum performance for 25 per cent option vesting and 15 per cent for 100 per cent option vesting, with a sliding scale between these points.
In addition, performance testing over the ten year option term is measured from a base point fixed at the date of grant.
Performance was tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if the target conditions at that time were not met in full, performance would be tested again on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant only, with the performance hurdle being increased in proportion to the extended period.
d UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a fixed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the contractual commitment to deliver Ordinary shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS and Spirent Sharesave Trust Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, 0.6 million Ordinary shares were transferred to participants 2006 1.4 million.
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003.
