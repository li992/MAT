Page 74 Notes to the accounts The directors report is on pages 24 to 26 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and the Companies Act 1985.
A consolidated Group cash flow statement has been included in the Aga Foodservice Group plc consolidated accounts: the Company has therefore taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 not to produce a cash flow statement.
Financial instruments The Companys objective in using financial instruments is to minimise its exposure to financial risk.
The Group treasurer co-ordinates banking arrangements, investment of surplus funds, ongoing borrowing requirements and the use of financial instruments, where appropriate.
The Company manages the financial instrument credit risk and investment risk by entering into transactions with established financial institutions and relationship banks.
Funding of major corporate-related transactions is carried out by the Group treasury function which operates as a cost centre.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
Policies for managing these risks are governed by board approved policies and procedures.
An outline of the Companys financial risk management policy is set out in the chief executives review on page 14.
The Companys borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 19 b of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The financial assets of 159.1m mature within one year and of the financial liabilities of 9.1m, 1.7m matures within one year and 7.4m matures within two to three years.
Floating rate borrowings are re-priced within six months from the balance sheet date.
The Company is exempt from FRS 29 disclosures.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenue and finance cost.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges such as forward currency contracts are recognised in equity, to the extent that the hedges are effective.
Any ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Amounts deferred in equity are released when the forecast hedged transaction impacts the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional currency and the presentation currency is pounds sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account, except when hedge accounting is applied.
These are taken directly to reserves until the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, at which time they are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences, using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
