Comparative disclosures have been restated based on the current reporting structure.
During the 2006 fiscal year, following a change in management responsibilities, the Groups minerals exploration and technology functions were removed from the Diamonds and Specialty Products CSG and are now reported as part of Group and unallocated items.
This change in segment reporting has been reflected in all periods presented and resulted in operating costs in 2006 of US$71 million 2005: US$69 million being reported in Group and unallocated items rather than Diamonds and Specialty Products.
Group and unallocated items represent Group centre functions and certain comparative data for divested assets and investments and exploration and technology activities.
It is the Groups policy that inter-segment sales are made on a commercial basis.
b EBITDA is profit from operations, before depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
