91 36 Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 2,504m 2006: 1,056m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
At the balance sheet date, the group has total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately 39.0m 2006: 31.8m relating to unresolved tax issues in various jurisdictions.
No provision has been made for these amounts on the basis that the group considers that the likelihood of the liabilities crystallising is improbable.
It is not possible to estimate the timing or outcome of these issues.
