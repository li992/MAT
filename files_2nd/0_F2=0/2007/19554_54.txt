122 Savills plc Our Results Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements 18 e. Acquisitions of subsidiaries continued For all acquisitions, there was no difference between the fair value and carrying value of net assets acquired.
Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method.
The Group acquires businesses intended for use on a continuing basis.
Goodwill is attributable to anticipated future operating synergies from the combination with existing businesses and perceived future economic benefits that will be generated from the staff client relationships acquired.
There were no significant changes to the provisional goodwill that arose in the previous year on acquisitions.
On 7 January 2007, the Group acquired the share capital of Hepher Dixon Limited for consideration of 5.1m.
