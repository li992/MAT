In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ECJ found in favour of the appellants, declaring that Investment Trusts should be treated as special investment funds and thus exempted from VAT on fees.
A separate decision by the House of Lords on the Conde Nast Case in January 2008 ruled that the imposition of a three year capping by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC, relating to claims submitted prior to January 1997, was invalid.
HMRC has announced that it would not appeal against either decision, enabling the Companys Manager F&C Management Limited to reclaim a proportion of VAT paid on behalf of the Company to HMRC in respect of periods between April 1990 and December 1996 and further periods since April 2001.
The amounts recoverable by the Manager on behalf of the Company, and the timing of the recoveries, are dependent upon negotiations between the Manager and HMRC, on the one hand, and between the Manager and the Company on the other.
Taking into account HMRCs acceptance of the ECJ and Conde Nast decisions, the Directors believe that the negotiations with the Manager have reached a position of clarity such that the Company is confident of recovering at least 5m of VAT via the Manager in respect of the relevant periods.
This sum has been recognised as a separate item within the Income Statement in the current year.
It has been allocated between revenue and capital returns in accordance with the accounting policies applicable to allocation of fees at the time the VAT was suffered.
The Directors are unable to state with certainty the extent to which they believe amounts in excess of the 5m already accrued will be recovered via the Manager.
