Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Exceptional items before interest and tax 2007 2006 Note m m Costs of proposed takeover of the Group a 6.7 - Ltip charges arising from the proposed takeover of the group b 2.0 - Restructuring of manufacturing facilities c 1.2 - Loss before interest and tax 9.9 - Certain items of income and expense were classified as exceptional in the financial statements due to their size, incidence or non-recurring nature: a Various costs, including financial advisors' fees of 4.0 million, legal fees of 1.3 million, and other advisors' fees of 1.0 million, were incurred in relation to the proposed acquisition of the Group by Cookson Group plc.
Certain fees which are contingent upon the completion of the acquisition have been accrued because there is believed to be a high likelihood of successful completion after the year-end, and services to which the fees relate had been substantially performed before the year-end.
See note 29 for events after the balance sheet date.
b The Remuneration Committee modified the performance conditions attached to Ltip awards such that they vest in full on the Court's sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement associated with the takeover, irrespective of the performance conditions determined at the dates of the grants.
This change increased the number of shares likely to vest, shortened the vesting periods of the grants, and changed the fair values of the awards, as detailed in note 22.
All these effects have been classified as exceptional.
c The manufacturing operations in Western Europe have been reviewed in the light of market conditions, and it has been decided to rationalise production to fit better the ongoing requirements of the business.
Due to the size and nature of the rationalisation costs, they have been classified as exceptional in these financial statements.
