In conjunction with the acquisition of Hutchison Essar, the Group entered into a share sale and purchase agreement with a Bharti group company regarding the Groups 5.60% direct shareholding in Bharti Airtel.
On 9 May 2007, the Bharti group company irrevocably agreed to purchase this shareholding and the Group expects to receive $1.6 billion in cash consideration for such shareholding by November 2008.
The shareholding will be transferred in two tranches, the first before 31 March 2008 and the second by November 2008.
Following the completion of this sale, the Group will continue to hold an indirect stake of 4.39% in Bharti Airtel.
EU Roaming On 23 May 2007, the European Parliament voted to introduce regulation on retail and wholesale roaming prices.
The Group expects roaming revenues to be lower year on year in 2008 due to the combined effect of Vodafones own initiatives and this direct regulatory intervention.
