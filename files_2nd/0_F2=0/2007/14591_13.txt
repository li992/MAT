The group manages this risk by maintaining adequate committed lines of funding from high quality lenders.
The facilities committed to the group as at 31 December 2007 are set out in Note 20. d Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits, and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed by transacting with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings.
Accordingly the groups associated credit risk is limited.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the group balance sheet.

13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.
The key features of share option contracts are described in Note 27.

The most significant elements of the groups total consolidated goodwill of 223.1m at 31 December 2007 are allocated to PANalytical 84.7m, BTG 50.6m, HBM 36.2m and Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration 23.0m.
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
There have been no indications of impairment in 2007.
As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on the most recent budgets for the next financial year.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based relate to growth rates and discount rates.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budgets do not exceed 2.5%.

Secured bank loans Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the groups subsidiaries.
Of these 1.5m is denominated in Chinese renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, 0.6m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 0.4m is denominated in euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes The interest rates on the unsecured loan notes are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any cross-currency interest rate swaps, and remain fixed until redemption.
On issue of the US$100m loan notes in October 2003, the group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap which has the effect of converting this US$ borrowing into fixed interest euro-denominated debt.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of 90.5m with a fixed interest rate of 5.64%.
This interest rate remains fixed until redemption.

For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US$ borrowings into euro borrowings is viewed as part of the groups net debt, as analysed below.

The fair value of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present values.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2007 is an asset of 0.1m 2006: asset of 1.3m of which 0.1m has been credited to the hedging reserve 2006: credit of 1.2m and nil credited to the income statement 2006: credit of 0.1m.

These contracts mature in the next 12 months, therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months.

Under adopted IFRS, the underlying US$ borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the cross-currency interest rate swaps.
In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the movements in the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swap during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.

However, the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship.
Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US$ borrowings in reserves, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the income statement within financing costs.
The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The principal borrowing amounts match exactly with the related unsecured loan note borrowings as described in Note 20.

Provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where the effect is significant, generally only where it is anticipated that a liability will crystallise in more than one year.
Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors best estimate of the cost to complete the restructuring.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the occasional extension up to 36 months.
The provision represents the directors best estimate of the groups liability based on past experience.
Other The company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations, but is expected to be within one to three years.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.

The retained earnings reserve also includes own shares purchased by the company and treated as treasury shares see Note 30.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the groups own shares.

72 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2007 27 Share-based payments The Executive Share Option Scheme and Save As You Earn share option schemes were set up in order to provide executives and selected employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the company.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
Share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth targets.
Options vest after a period of three years, and have a maximum term of ten years.
Under the Performance Share Plan, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the companys shares.
Awards are subject to performance criteria, 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of earnings growth targets and 50% subject to a Total Shareholder Return target.
Awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the twelve-month period following vesting.
Under the Save As You Earn scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
