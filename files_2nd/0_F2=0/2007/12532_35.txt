Convertible bonds In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of 15.82 per share there are 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 June 2014.
Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.
$ million Nominal value of convertible bonds issued net of issue costs 244.0 Equity component 51.8 Liability component at date of issue 192.2 Interest charged 7.0 Interest paid 3.6 Total liability component as at 31 December 2007 195.6 The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued.
The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent to US$250 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and their fair value.
This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
