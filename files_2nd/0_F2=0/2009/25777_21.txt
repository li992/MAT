Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th September 2009 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, performance fees realised and other capital receipts and payments, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end, provisions for performance fees and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Deposit interest receivable and stock lending income are taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: - performance fees are allocated 100% to capital: - expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and include items such as stamp duty and brokerage commissions.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 41: - Subscription shares issue costs are charged to share premium.
e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 | 35 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 30th September 2009 f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end, are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments and loans arising from a change in exchange rates are included in Holding gains and losses on investments.
h Taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is allocated to capital.
i Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 The diluted return loss per Ordinary share represents the return loss on ordinary activities after taxation divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year as adjusted for the conversion of all outstanding Subscription shares into Ordinary shares at the year end.
For this purpose, the assumed proceeds from this conversion are regarded as having been received from the issue of Ordinary shares at the average market price of Ordinary shares during the year.
The difference between the number of Ordinary shares issued and the number of Ordinary shares that would have been issued at the average market price of Ordinary shares during the year is treated as an issue of Ordinary shares for no consideration.
There was no dilution to the returns for the year ended 30th September 2008 as there were no dilutive potential Ordinary shares in issue at that date.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Company's risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: - investments in equity shares of overseas companies which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: - short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: - index futures and currency transactions for hedging purposes: - multi currency loan facilities with Lloyds TSB and ING.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Company's net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing would be limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys overseas income and monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% 2008: 20% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 521 1,298 Capital return 1,701 3,312 Total return after taxation for the year 1,180 4,610 Net assets 1,180 4,610 Conversely if sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation: Revenue return 521 1,298 Capital return 1,701 3,312 Total return after taxation for the year 1,180 4,610 Net assets 1,180 4,610 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities is broadly representative of the whole year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into other price risk sensitivity on page 51. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Company's variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Companys actual gearing range may fluctuate between 90% and 120%.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the loan facilities.
However, amounts drawn down on these facilities are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30th September comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 358,728 225,104 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 11 and 12.
This shows that the portfolio comprises investments quoted on Asian stockmarkets.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that region.
However it should be noted that an investment may not necessarily be wholly exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Bank loan facilities are used to gear the Company as appropriate.
Details of the current facilities are given in part a ii to this note on page 49.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2009 2008 Three Three months More than months More than or less one year Total or less one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased for future settlement 2,630 2,630 1,286 1,286 Bank loan 6,253 6,253 Other creditors and accruals 235 235 196 196 Tax payable 233 233 341 341 Creditors : amounts falling due after more than one year Bank loan 25,010 25,010 9,351 25,010 34,361 1,823 1,823 JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust plc.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in a loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager regularly monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Companys assets are clearly ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore, in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading, these assets would be protected.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and short term deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.
Cash and short term deposits comprises balances held at banks that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
There were no securities on loan at 30th September 2009.
The highest value of securities on loan during the year ended 30th September 2009 amounted to 2,665,000.
Collateral is obtained by JPMorgan Asset Management and is called in on a daily basis to a value of 102% of the value of the securities on loan if that collateral is denominated in the same currency as the securities on loan and 105% if it is denominated in a different currency.
Collateral acceptable under the Stock Lending Agreement may comprise: cash in sterling, euros or US dollars, Eurozone government securities, UK government securities and US government securities.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying amount in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
