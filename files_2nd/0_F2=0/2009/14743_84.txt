EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS i Exceptional items During the year, the Group disposed of 50% of its equity shareholding in Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited GGOWL to RWE npower renewables Limited, the UK fully owned subsidiary of RWE Innogy GmbH for a total cash consideration of 308.5m.
GGOWL was originally a jointly controlled entity between Airtricity, acquired by SSE in February 2008, and Fluor International Limited.
In May 2008, SSE acquired Fluors 50% stake for a cash consideration of 40.0m, while stating its intention to dispose of it later in the year.
The total proceeds on disposal was 308.5m, which comprised 165.6m reimbursement of 50% of the capital costs already incurred in developing the project and 142.9m in relation to the 50% of the equity.
The gain on sale recognised was 102.7m, which has been disclosed separately in the income statement as an exceptional item.
While no tax charge was recognised in relation to the gain on disposal, a tax credit was recognised on the reversal of deferred tax related to the derecognition of fair-value items deemed to have been part of the costs of disposal 5.7m.
Further detail on this transaction is included at note 15.
In the previous financial year, the Group disposed of telecoms sites assets to the Wireless Infrastructure Company Limited, for a consideration of 79.0m.
The gain recognised on this disposal was 55.0m.
This gain has been disclosed separately in the income statement.
Also in the previous financial year, the Group incurred an unhedged translation loss of 22.2m on denominated debt held in relation to the acquisition of Airtricity Holdings Limited see note 15.
This has been recognised as exceptional following the Groups decision to restructure the borrowings associated with this element of the acquisition in order to match sterling exposures with sterling funding.
As a consequence this translation loss was a non-recurring item.
ii Certain re-measurements Certain re-measurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category includes the movement on derivatives as described in note 29. iii Taxation The Group has separately recognised the tax effect of the exceptional items and certain re-measurements summarised above.
In addition to this, the Group has also separately disclosed in the previous financial year the effect of the change in the base corporation tax rate of 30% to 28%, which was effective from 1 April 2008.
This had an impact on any temporary differences which existed at 1 April 2008 note 8.
