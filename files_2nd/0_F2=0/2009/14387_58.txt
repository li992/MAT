110 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the accounts continued 20 Financial risk management continued c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AAor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
