20 Transfers of financial assets not qualifying for fide-recognition HSBC enters into transactions in the normal course of business by which it transfers recognised financial assets directly to third parties or to SPEs.
These transfers may give rise to the full or partial derecognition of the financial assets concerned.
Full derecognition occurs when HSBC transfers its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the right but assumes an obligation to pass on the cash flows from the asset, and transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
The risks include credit, interest rate, currency, prepayment and other price risks.
Partial derecognition occurs when HSBC sells or otherwise transfers financial assets in such a way that some but not substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred but control is retained.
These financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet to the extent of HSBCs continuing involvement.
The majority of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition are i debt securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements or ii equity securities lent under securities lending agreements.
The following table analyses the carrying amount of financial assets that did not qualify for derecognition and their associated financial liabilities: Financial assets and associated financial liabilities not qualifying for derecognition 2009 2008 Carrying Carrying Carrying Carrying amount of amount of amount of amount of transferred associated transferred associated assets liabilities assets liabilities US$m US$m US$m US$m Nature of transaction Repurchase agreements............................................................ 108,518 107,525 94,154 91,139 Securities lending agreements.................................................. 7,363 7,264 4,497 4,096 115,881 114,789 98,651 95,235 A small proportion of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition relate to loans, credit cards, debt securities and trade receivables that have been securitised under arrangements by which HSBC retains a continuing involvement in such transferred assets.
Continuing involvement may entail retaining the rights to future cash flows arising from the assets after investors have received their contractual terms for example, interest rate strips : providing subordinated interest: liquidity support: continuing to service the underlying asset: or entering into derivative transactions with the securitisation vehicles.
As such, HSBC continues to be exposed to risks associated with these transactions.
The rights and obligations that HSBC retains from its continuing involvement in securitisations are initially recorded as an allocation of the fair value of the financial asset between the part that is derecognised and the part that continues to be recognised on the date of transfer.
