The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2007 and has been updated to 31 March 2009 by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The deficit on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the deficit has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd as it is not possible to do so on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc portion of it.
As part of the formal triennial valuation of the United Kingdom defined benefit pension scheme at 31 March 2007, which has been agreed in principle with the Trustee of the scheme, the Group considered the prospective future cost and volatility of the UK defined benefit scheme structure.
This has led to the Group concluding a consultation, on 3 April 2008, with the membership of the scheme over a number of changes.
The changes are designed to reduce the cost and volatility of maintaining the UK defined benefit scheme going forward and were applied from June 2008.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities of the scheme were: 2009 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.25% 5.90% 5.25% Rate of increase in salaries 2.55% 3.80% 3.85% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.00% 3.60% 3.10% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.60% 3.10% The assumption on the rate of increase of salaries has been limited.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.
The expected long-term rates of return on the scheme assets as at 31 March were: 2009 2008 2007 Equities 7.20% 7.60% 7.40% Corporate bonds 5.75% 5.40% 4.50% Diversified growth funds 6.70% 7.10% n a Enhanced matching funds 3.40% 4.25% n a Government bonds 3.70% 4.10% 3.90% Cash 0.00% 4.75% 4.50% The valuation of the assets of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Equities 79.9 113.2 203.7 Corporate bonds 14.4 14.6 24.0 Government bonds 16.5 18.9 41.6 Diversified growth funds 94.0 98.9 Enhanced matching funds 34.8 27.9 Cash 0.7 0.9 2.6 Total market value of assets 240.3 274.4 271.9 The valuation of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2009 2008 m m Total market value of assets 240.3 274.4 Present value of scheme liabilities 246.6 296.2 Deficit in the scheme recognised in the accounts of RS Components Ltd 6.3 21.8 Related deferred tax asset 1.8 6.1 Net pension liabilitiy 4.5 15.7 In addition, the value of the assets held in respect of AVCs amounted to 0.6m as at 31 March 2009 2008: 0.9m.
