6 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based incentive plans for employees.
These comprise an Executive Incentive Plan EIP awarded to the Groups most senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awarded to senior managers and employees, a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme that is made available to the majority of employees and a US s423 option scheme that is offered to all permanent employees in the US operating company.
In addition there was a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP which operated until 2005, awarding options to senior managers.
The LTIOP and SAYE schemes were in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under all these schemes, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 46 6 Share-based payments continued Executive Incentive Plan EIP The EIP scheme is a one-off conditional award on 1 February 2006 of shares to the 12 most senior executives in the Group to be delivered following the financial year ended 31 March 2009.
The number of shares to be awarded was dependent on the performance of the Group during the year ended 31 March 2009 varying between 0 and 2,700,000.
The awards included a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
During 2007 further options for new senior executives totalling 221,000 options were granted.
The fair value of the EIP options was calculated using a Black-Scholes model based on the assumptions below.
No further share options were issued during the year ended 31 March 2009.
At 29 May 2009 all share options relating to the EIP scheme lapsed.
EIP EIP 2007 2006 Fair value at grant date 280p 300p Assumptions used Share price 280p 300p Expected volatility 22.4% 39.7% Expected option life 1.75 years 3.25 years Risk free interest rate 5.5% 4.4% Volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the shares over a three year and two year period respectively up to the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIOP schemes were awarded to key senior employees at a grant price equal to the Groups share price.
The vesting conditions include a continuation of service, a minimum of three years, and the performance of the Groups shares against a comparator group.
The share price is tested against this group after three years and can be retested after four and five years if the options have not vested.
The proportion of the options vesting is also dependent on the comparative share performance.
The share options can be exercised up to 10 years after the grant date.
Any options remaining unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant will expire.
In June 2006 a new Executive Plan the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP conditional award of shares was made.
The vesting conditions are based on Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 over the three year life of the scheme.
At the vesting date the share award will either vest or lapse.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
In June 2007 a further conditional award of shares was made.
In June 2008 the terms and conditions of the LTIP were modified such that the vesting conditions are based on both the performance of the TSR of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and growth of the Groups nominal Earnings per Share.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Committee report on page 29.
The fair value of the LTIOP and LTIP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.

Save As You Earn SAYE schemes The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
They provide an option price equal to the daily average market price at the date of the offer less 20%.
The French scheme may be offered at a different rate to ensure compliance with French regulations.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for the three or five year period and the maintenance of employees regular monthly savings in an account.
Failure of either of these conditions is deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions attached to the vesting of the options.
US s423 scheme The US s423 scheme is available to permanent employees of Allied Electronics Inc. the Groups US operating company.
The options are granted to those who elect to participate and the scheme has a savings element similar to the SAYE scheme.
At the end of one year up to 20% of the options can be exercised with the remainder exercisable after 2 years.
The option price is the lesser of 85% of the market value of the shares on the date of grant and the date of exercise.
The fair value of the options was calculated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes model and the assumptions used are shown below.

The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2009 amounted to 3.2m 2008: 3.5m excluding the one-off credit due to pension scheme changes and curtailments of 16.7m.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 2.6m 2008: 1.8m.
The increase in contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution scheme is largely attributable to the introduction of a salary sacrifice scheme whereby the company contributes in place of employees contribution.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction which defines the interaction of the defined benefit assets and any minimum funding requirement will apply for future reporting periods.
If the interpretation was applied to the current reporting period, there would be no material impact on the Income Statement or Retained Earnings at the year end.
In addition to the UK scheme outlined above there are certain pension benefits provided on a defined benefit basis in Germany and Ireland amounting to 1.3m 2008: 1.1m, defined contribution basis in Australia and North America amounting to 1.3m 2008: 1.0m, and via government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia amounting to 3.2m 2008: 2.6m.
The Group expects to pay 5.9m to its UK defined benefit pension plan in 2010.
The principal assumptions used in the valuations of the liabilities of the Groups schemes were: 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 United Republic United Republic Kingdom Germany of Ireland Kingdom Germany of Ireland Discount rate 6.25% 5.90% 5.90% 5.90% 5.50% 5.50% Rate of increase in salaries 2.55% 3.00% 4.00% 3.80% 3.00% 4.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.00% 2.75% 2.75% 3.60% 2.50% 2.50% Inflation assumption 3.00% 2.75% 2.75% 3.60% 2.50% 2.50% The assumption on the rate of increase of salaries in the UK scheme has been limited.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.

Value in use calculations The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on actual operating results together with management projections for six years.
These cash flow projections are assessed for the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions: for example by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows.
Cash flows for further periods, i. e. beyond six years, are extrapolated using a long term annual growth rate of 2% 2008: 2% which is consistent with the market estimate long-term average growth rate for the industry.
A period of more than five years has been used as the Directors believe that this is a reasonable assumption since the investments are being held for the long-term.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2008: 9% has been applied in calculating the discounted projected cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used are the sales growth rate and discount rate.
The sales growth rate is prepared using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium term plans together with relevant macro economic indicators.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the long-term average growth rates for the industry and do not exceed expected long term GDP growth.
The discount rate is based upon the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC at 31 March 2009 and has been calculated reflecting market assessments at that time.
The Directors believe that currently all reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
Outcome of calculations The recoverable amount of the Allied business exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.

Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 60 20 Financial instruments continued Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.
Derivatives For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Forward exchange contracts are valued by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward rate.
The rates used represent active market prices for actively traded instruments.
Interest-bearing loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year the carrying amount approximates fair value.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at market rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Receivables and payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.
Each of these are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
The policies are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Groups key priority is to ensure that it can always meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group ensures this by always having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet all its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2009 the Group had two committed revolving bank facilities: a syndicated multicurrency facility for 142m, $137m and 47m with a maturity of September 2012 and a bilateral facility for 25m with a maturity of March 2010.
It also had a fully drawn bank facility for Yen 800m with a maturity of December 2010 and a fully drawn, amortising, bank facility of 2.7m as at 31 March 2009, with a final maturity of December 2011.
The 2.7m bank facility is secured on the Groups warehouse in Bad Hersfeld.
As at 31 March 2009 the Group had available 113.5m of undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short term money market loans, cash and short term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day to day funding and liquidity requirements.

Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Hedging of currency exposures over operating company catalogue period is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits over those catalogue periods.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until catalogue selling prices can be changed in light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
Within cash flow hedges the Group classifies forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables.
The forecast cash flows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 17 months from the year end, and will affect the Income Statement in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2009 was 1.8m.

The carrying amount of the US hedge as at 31 March 2009 was US $170m 118.9m, of which $128.5m 89.9m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and $41.5m 29.0m was in the form of an overdraft.
The carrying amount of the Euro hedge was 65m 60.2m, of which 38m 35.2m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and 27m 25.0m was in the form of an overdraft.
Both the US Dollar and Euro overdrafts are shown in the balance sheet netted with positive cash balances, as there is an absolute right of set-off.
The carrying value of these $ and hedges remained unchanged, and 100% effective, throughout the year ended 31 March 2009 and the year ended 31 March 2008.
A foreign exchange loss of 41.7m 2008: loss 6.5m was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to Sterling in the year ended 31 March 2009.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economic and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a degree of hedging.
Guidelines are in place to manage the currency mix of the Groups net debt.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore relatively low interest rate risk.
For this reason the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
Two interest rate swaps have been entered into in order to hedge interest rate risk.
The swaps mature over the next four years following the maturity of the related loans, one of which is amortising, and have fixed swap rates of 1.15% and 3.85%.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had interest rate swaps with notional contract amounts of Yen 800m and 2.7m 2008: Yen 800m and 3.6m.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair market value: Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective: Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end: All net investment and foreign currency cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers and geographical location.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
Financial assets The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.
Trade and other receivables All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trading receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis each month by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.

The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to shareholders.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 66 21 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 0.1 0.4 11.2 12.7 11.1 12.3 Goodwill 36.9 22.3 36.9 22.3 Retirement benefit obligations 1.9 6.1 1.9 6.1 Inventories 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.1 Employee benefits 0.9 1.4 0.9 1.4 Provisions 2.3 1.3 2.3 1.3 Other items 3.4 5.8 0.3 0.6 3.1 5.2 Tax losses 19.4 10.8 19.4 10.8 Tax assets liabilities 28.1 26.0 48.7 35.7 20.6 9.7 Set off of tax 17.4 11.3 17.4 11.3 Net tax assets liabilities 10.7 14.7 31.3 24.4 20.6 9.7 A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2009 2008 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 14.0 14.0 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of tax losses which can be carried forward against future taxable income as recoverability is uncertain.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was expected to be 5.9m 2008: 5.9m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Further, the Group has sufficient relevant losses to offset fully the 5.9m liability.
