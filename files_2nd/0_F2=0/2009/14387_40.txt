No additional tax liabilities have been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the timing of other temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the future.
Other deferred tax also includes the tax benefits of losses carried forward amounting to 31.3m 2008: 26.7m.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of 78.3m 2008: 102.2m, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below.
