Previously, adjusted earnings per share calculations did not exclude pension interest, however this number is dependent upon the pension valuation at 31 March each year and assumptions based on financial market conditions on that date and therefore excluding it gives a better indication of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
Comparative numbers have been restated accordingly see Note 9.
