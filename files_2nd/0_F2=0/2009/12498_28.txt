100 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 18 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Euro and US dollar.
The Group hedges significant foreign currency exposures in respect of forecast sales and purchases of inventory through foreign exchange contracts.
All such foreign exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cash flow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movement in foreign exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long term investments in overseas assets.
At 1 February 2009, if the US dollar had weakened strengthened against the pound sterling by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would not have been significantly different as a result of a similar one cent movement.
At 1 February 2009, if the Euro had weakened strengthened against the pound sterling by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would have been 0.7 million lower higher as a result of a similar one cent movement.
Estimation of fair values The main methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Derivatives: forward exchange contracts are marked to market using listed market prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings: fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Convertible redeemable preference shares: fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Trade and other receivables payables: the notional amount for trade receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year are deemed to reflect their fair value.
Net fair value of derivative financial instruments The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast trading transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted trading transactions at 3 February 2009 was 4.4 million 3 February 2008: 2.9 million, which was reflected in a hedging reserve at that date.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups US dollar denominated private placement notes totalling $225 million and unsecured loans of $10 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its US subsidiaries.
The Groups Euro denominated unsecured loans of Euro 17 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its European Union member subsidiaries.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 1 February 2009 was 180.7 million 3 February 2008: 142.1 million and the fair value of the Euro borrowings was 15.0 million 3 February 2008: 7.5 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 48.0 million 3 February 2008: loss of 0.6 million was recognised in equity during the year on translation of these loans to pounds sterling.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group will take in to consideration the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, the level of debt and the number of shares in issue.
When monitoring capital, the Group takes into consideration its gearing ratio, both including and excluding its defined benefit pension obligations.
This is calculated as the ratio of net debt to total equity adjusted for pension obligations as appropriate.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings and the debt element of preference shares as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total equity is as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The defined benefit obligations are shown in note 27 a to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
At the year end the net debt to total equity ratio adjusted to exclude pension obligations was 17.8:1 2008: -13.0:1.
The Group also monitors its consolidated adjusted net worth.
Consolidated adjusted net worth is calculated as total equity plus any amount in respect of preference shares included in non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
At the year end, consolidated adjusted net worth was 53.8 million 2008: 106.0 million.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was 1.0 million which is being amortised over a period of ten years.
The historic trading results and cash flows of Microdis are not significant and the trading results and cash flows of the business in the period since acquisition are negligible due to the acquisition being close to the Groups financial year end.

For 2009, the rates of longevity for the UK Plan are based on standard tables known as the 2000 series with long cohort improvements from 2000 and a plus 2 year age rating 2008: based on standard tables PA92, projected to the year 2005, with an age rating of minus three years applied for non pensioners and minus two years for pensioners.
For the US Plan, for 2009 and 2008 the rates of longevity are based on standard tables RP 2000 with generational projections using scale AA.

b Post-retirement medical benefits In the US, the Group provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits to certain US employees.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used to account for pension obligations.
The charge for the year was 0.6 million 2008: 0.5 million and the balance sheet obligation at 1 February 2009 amounted to 11.1 million 2008: 8.0 million.
The disclosures relating to post-retirement medical benefits are based on an actuarial valuation performed by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Actuaries and Pension Consultants, as at 1 February 2009.
The principal assumptions were as follows: 2009 2008 % % 6.5 Discount rate 6.5 Medical inflation 5.0 5.0 Life expectancy of a 60 year old male current retiree 24 yrs 24 yrs Life expectancy of a 60 year old male future retiree 25 yrs 25 yrs The assumed long-term rate of medical inflation is 5.0% per annum.
In 2009, the initial rate has been assumed to be 9.0% which is assumed to reduce to the long-term rate at 0.5% per annum over 8 years.
In 2008, the initial rate was 9.5% assumed to reduce to the long-term rate at 0.5% per annum over 9 years.
For 2009, future life expectancy is based on RP 2000 mortality tables with generational projections using scale AA.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2009 2008 52 weeks 53 weeks m m Service cost 0.1 0.1 Interest cost 0.5 0.4 Total charge included in operating expenses 0.6 0.5 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 m m m m m Beginning of year 8.0 7.4 7.1 5.5 4.7 Service cost 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3 Interest cost 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.6 Payments 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.4 Actuarial losses 0.1 0.7 0.8 1.1 Currency translation adjustment 2.9 0.1 0.7 0.4 0.3 11.1 End of year 8.0 7.4 7.1 5.5 115 Premier Farnell Annual Report & Accounts 2009 27 Pension commitments and other post-retirement obligations continued Cumulative actuarial gains and losses recognised in equity: 2009 2008 m m Beginning of year 2.6 1.9 Net actuarial losses recognised in the year 0.1 0.7 End of year 2.7 2.6 The effect of a 1% movement in the assumed medical cost trend rate is as follows: Increase Decrease m m Increase decrease in the aggregate of the current service cost and interest cost 0.1 0.1 Increase decrease in the defined benefit obligation 1.4 1.4 History of experience gains and losses: 2009 2008 2007 2006 Experience losses on defined benefit obligation: Amount m 0.1 0.9 0.3 0.4 Percentage of the present value of liabilities 0.9% 11.3% 4.1% 5.6% Gain loss arising from change in assumptions: Amount m 0.2 0.5 0.7 Percentage of the present value of liabilities 2.5% 6.8% 9.9% 28 Operating lease commitments The Group has total minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: Land and buildings Other assets 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Due within one year 3.8 4.0 0.5 0.3 Due between one and five years 7.1 6.7 2.3 2.3 Due after five years 1.2 0.4 12.1 2.8 Continuing operations 11.1 2.6
