Consolidated financial statements and notes Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2009 I Summary of signi cant accounting policies The basis of preparation and the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial information are set out below.
A Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modi ed by the share options at fair value through the pro t and loss account and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and all applicable UK accounting standards.
B Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is United States Dollars.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the pro t and loss account.
C Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
D Share capital, share premium and dividend distribution Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
E Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable pro ts at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be a suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
F Employee bene t costs a Pension obligations The Company operates a fide ned contribution plan for which it pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee bene t expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Share based compensation The Company operated various equity-settled, share based compensation plans during the year.
No expense is recognised in respect of share options granted before 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2005.
For shares or share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vested after 1 January 2005 the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the pro t and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The shares are recognised when the options are exercised and the proceeds received allocated between share capital and share premium.
II Pro t attributable to the Company As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate pro t and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
