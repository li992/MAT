Accounting policies continued The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include: Goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to determine such assets, to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations Under IFRS3 Business Combinations, it is necessary to separately identify and value any acquired intangible assets.
In order to ascertain the values of the separate assets it is necessary for management to estimate the future cash flows attributable to the asset and estimate their useful economic lives.
A deferred tax asset is recognised on acquisition when relevant.
Pensions The liability recognised in relation to retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of assumptions, including discount rate, mortality rate, salary increases and inflation.
Any change in these assumptions would change the amount recognised see Note 34.

A. and Technical Ordnance, Inc. - 1.4 million.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 68 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 13.
Goodwill continued assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured the weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The discount rate used for both divisions is 7.5% 2008: 10.0%.
The calculation has used the Groups plan figures for the next five years.
At the end of five years, it assumes the performance of the Group companies will continue in perpetuity at the fifth year level.
The growth rates are based on a prudent view of industry growth forecasts, adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior impairment losses reversed.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
The sensitivity testing involved varying the discount rate and the forecasted growth during the next five years.
Even with an assumption of zero growth, both CGUs would not require an impairment.

No interest is charged on the receivables from the date of invoice to payment.
The Groups policy is to provide in full for debtors greater than 120 days beyond agreed terms, unless extenuating circumstances exist.
The Group does not experience significant bad debt write-offs and hence no movement schedule for the allowance for doubtful debts has been provided due to its immaterial level in 2009 and 2008.
An ageing analysis has not been shown as all significant overdue receivables are covered by the allowance for doubtful debts provision above.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
Cash and cash equivalents Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

Bank loans held with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania USA are secured on the related assets purchased with these loans by Alloy Surfaces Company, Inc..
The security over the US loan notes ranks pari passu with that held by Bank of Scotland.
As the loans are re-translated to the year end exchange rates, the directors do not believe the fair value of the Groups borrowings to be materially different to the book values.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the loan agreements or defaults during the current or previous year.
The Group has the following undrawn borrowing facilities in various currencies available in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met.
These facilities are at floating interest rates.

Financial instruments and risk management The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so.
The main risks addressed by the financial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, were as follows: Market risk The Groups multi-national activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investments in overseas businesses which have currencies other than sterling as their functional currency.
Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
Forward currency structures to hedge the exchange risk arising on translation of the overseas business profits.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk: Transactional risk: The Group policy is to hedge significant transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored on a Group-wide basis.
Translation risk: The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 3.
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end were as follows: 2009 2008 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$ Monetary assets million 100.9 34.1 36.8 4.8 83.9 55.0 32.6 5.3 Monetary liabilities million 185.3 84.7 42.1 2.0 168.2 105.0 45.6 1.1 Currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
The borrowings detailed below were designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
2009 2008 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$ Borrowings million 147.1 57.6 33.9 - 125.0 66.9 35.0 - The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the year end.
When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The most significant exchange rate to manage as far as the Group is concerned is the sterling: US dollar exchange rate.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of foreign currencies outstanding as at 31 October: Average exchange rate Expiring within one year 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m US dollar 1.66 2.04 39.4 9.0 Euro 1.01 1.39 1.2 2.0 Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 74 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued At the year end, there was one US dollar structure in place which was set up to protect the Income Statement from currency fluctuations during 2009 and through to October 2011, and provides an economic hedge.
The structure involves a cap and a collar, which lock in the exchange rates to give the Group the appropriate protection.
However, the structure does not give linear relationships with the gain or loss from re-translation of future profits and hence hedge accounting has not been adopted for this financial instrument.
At 31 October 2009, a 0.2 million loss is shown as an adjustment to underlying operating profit and represents the fair value of the structure.
The significant change arises due to the appreciation of the US dollar since the new structure was implemented in March 2009.
The appreciation of the dollar has locked the structure into a fixed rate of 1.66 on a currency amount of $72 million in the year to October 2010 and $54 million in the year to October 2011.
The principal amounts of the Groups Euro, NOK and US dollar bank loans and loan notes have been accounted for as net investment hedges on the European, Norwegian and US businesses.
These hedges are effective throughout the year and the losses arising on translation have been offset against the gains on re-translation of the subsidiaries in reserves.
Interest on borrowing is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into except for interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risks.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 cents movement in the relevant foreign currencies against sterling.
10 cents represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10 cents change in foreign currency rates.
A negative number indicates a decrease in profit and equity where sterling strengthens against the relevant currency.
US dollar impact Euro impact 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m Loss 9.8 7.8 4.6 3.5 Other equity 9.8 7.8 4.6 3.5 The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency increased during the year, mainly due to the growth of the US and European subsidiaries.
These potential losses arising on the year end foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities would be more than offset by future translation and transaction gains.
In the managements opinion the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and leasing lines of credit.
The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling, Euro, US dollar and Norwegian Kroner, and are subject to floating rates of interest linked to the Bank of Scotland base rate.
In order to protect against the risk of higher interest rates, the Group has entered into amortising interest rate swaps for the majority of its UK borrowings.
The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are predominantly subject to fixed rates of interest.
During 2007, the Group refinanced part of its Bank of Scotland borrowing facilities with a private placement of ten year fixed interest loan notes in the US.
The arrangement provides a natural hedge against the Groups investment structure in its US businesses.
The US loan notes are repayable in full in 2017.
Euro, NOK and sterling floating rate borrowings have interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on the floating rate debt and were all designated as cash flow hedges.
The sterling loan was repaid in November 2009 and as such the interest rate hedge was fide-recognised at the year end.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date.
Period of swap contracts Fixed rate From To Currency value % m Sterling bank loans 3.64.76 November 2007 April 2014 23.9 Euro bank loans 3.674.35 November 2007 April 2014 58.1 NOK bank loans 5.495 November 2007 April 2012 35.0 As the Group has predominantly fixed interest rate loans, the Income Statement is not sensitive to a small change in interest rates.
The range represents the two applicable interest rates incurred during the swap contracts.
The swap instruments match the interest payment profiles of the medium term debt.
As a result of restructuring the interest rate swap for the euro loan, a mark to market loss of 3.5 million was rolled up into the new hedge agreement, effective from May 2009.
This cost is being amortised over the life of the original hedge relationship, with 0.5 million charged during the year 2008: nil.

Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 77 Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivable consists of a small number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas.
Customers are mainly multi-national organisations or government agencies with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The majority of the Groups business is with the US Department of Defense and the UK Ministry of Defence, and as such the credit risk on debtors is considered to be very low.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, when appropriate, action is taken to minimise the credit risk to the Group.
The Groups price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered significant.
Price risk is managed through negotiations with suppliers and, where appropriate, the agreement of fixed price supply contracts.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding non-redeemable preference shares and minority interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on the market prices.
Primarily, the shares are intended to be used for satisfying awards under the Groups share-based incentive schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Intangible assets relate principally to customer relationships and technology.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of total cost over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies and assembled workforces acquired.
The acquisition during the year contributed 45.6 million of revenue and 9.9 million to the Groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues and profits before tax for the year would have been approximately 510.4 million and 97.2 million respectively.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of the future results of the combined operations.
Pensions Within the UK, the Group formerly operated two defined benefit schemes, the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme the Staff Scheme and the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme the Executive Scheme for part of the year.
The schemes were merged on 6 April 2009.
All assets 5.3 million and liabilities 6.8 million of the Executive Scheme were transferred to the Staff Scheme on this date.
The Executive Scheme was wound up on 28 July 2009.
No members of either scheme were adversely affected by this merger.
In Germany, Chemring Defence Germany GmbH operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Defence Germany Scheme and in Norway, Chemring Nobel AS operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Nobel Scheme.
The other UK and overseas arrangements are all defined contribution schemes.
The Staff Scheme is a funded scheme and the assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
A full actuarial valuation for the Staff Scheme as at 6 April 2006 has been prepared and updated to 31 October 2009 by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The main assumptions for the scheme are detailed below.
The Staff Scheme triennial valuation at 6 April 2009 is currently being progressed, and is expected to be signed-off in the coming months.
The Group increased the value of its bank guarantee to the Staff Scheme from 6.0 million to 7.2 million during the year as a consequence of the merger of the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme on 6 April 2009.
The guarantee may be drawn upon in certain events of default by the Company.
The Group has also placed 5.0 million in an escrow account to provide additional funding for the Staff Scheme in the event of a default see Note 20.
Since the year end, the Company has placed an additional 5.0 million in the escrow account in accordance with the agreed funding plan for the Staff Scheme.
The Chemring Defence Germany Scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 October 2009 by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.3%, inflation rate of 1.8% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of nil%.
The net deficit of the Chemring Defence Germany Scheme was 1.2 million at 31 October 2009 2008: 1.1 million.
The Chemring Nobel Scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 4.4%, inflation rate of 2.75% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of 1.3%.
The net deficit of the Chemring Nobel Scheme was 1.5 million at 31 October 2009 2008: 1.4 million.

For the Staff Scheme, the actuarial table currently used is PA92 YOB MC 1, with a 1% underpin.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate in the scheme was to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by approximately 1.3 million.
A change in the rate of inflation by 0.1% is predicted to change the deficit by approximately 1.0 million.
The Group anticipates contributions to the defined benefit schemes for the year ending 31 October 2010 will be 1.9 million 2008: 1.7 million.

Post balance sheet events Private placement of loan notes On 19 November 2009 the Group completed a private placement of $280 million of fixed interest loan notes with a number of institutional investors.
$80 million of the loan notes will mature in November 2016, and $200 million will mature in November 2019.
The total issue carries an interest rate of approximately 5.5%, a more favourable rate than the Group currently enjoys.
The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of Hi-Shear Technology Corporation, repay existing short and medium term debt, and provide additional working capital facilities for the Group.
Acquisition of Hi-Shear Technology Corporation Hi-Shear On 25 November 2009 the Group completed the purchase of the entire stock capital of Hi-Shear for a cash consideration of $132 million.
As a technology business the net book value of the assets acquired was minimal therefore a significant intangible asset is expected.
The fair values of the acquisition are currently being calculated.
Full disclosure of the acquisition and the analysis of assets acquired will be included in the 2010 Interim Report.
Conditional acquisition of The Allied Defense Group, Inc. On 19 January 2010 the Group announced the conditional acquisition of The Allied Defense Group, Inc. for a cash consideration of $59 million.
The consideration for this acquisition will also be funded from the recent loan note issue.
