The movement in the provision for impairment of other financial assets during the year is as follows: 2009 2008 $m $m At 1 January 11 9 Provided: Operating profit before exceptional items 2 Exceptional items note 5 14 At 31 December 25 11 The amount provided as an exceptional item relates to an available-for-sale equity investment and arises as a result of a significant and prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost.
In addition, a deposit of $26m has been written off directly to the income statement as an exceptional item see note 5 as it is no longer considered recoverable under the terms of the related management contracts which are deemed onerous.
