ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 115 Reserves Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report for the year ended 31 December 2009 SRK Consulting UK Ltd. SRK has reviewed the GKZ reserve statements of the mining assets of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation plc ENRC as prepared in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of Kazakhstan, as of 31 December 2009.
SRK has restated these as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the terms and definitions given in the 2004 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves the JORC Code as published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.
SRK has modified and translated ENRCs GKZ reserve statements for reporting in accordance with the JORC Code without recourse to fundamental recalculation.
In 2007, SRK prepared an independent mineral experts report MER on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of ENRC.
An abridged version of this MER was included in the prospectus published by the Company in connection with the admission of the ordinary shares of the Company to trading on the London Stock Exchange plcs market for listed securities in December 2007 the IPO.
The MER contained Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements in accordance with the JORC Code, dated 1 July 2007.
In 2008, SRK carried out a desktop review of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, and provided an updated statement in line with the JORC Code, based on a review of the depletion of the reserves from the annual submissions to the Kazakhstan Government, the actual production figures from the mines and any information on significant changes to the operations provided to SRK by ENRC.
No site visits were undertaken.
In 2009 and 2010, the auditing of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves has been carried out in significantly more detail than the 2008 review, with site visits being undertaken on a two to three year basis.
Visits to Kazchromes Donskoy GOK ferrochrome operations and Zhairemsky GOKs iron manganese operations were undertaken in February 2009.
Visits to Eurasian Energy Corporations EEC Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine and the SSGPO iron ore mines were undertaken in February 2010.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements as of 31 December 2008, as prepared by SRK during the 2009 review, form the basis for the current update.
SRK has reviewed the Ore Reserve Statements in conjunction with the current consensus market forecast commodity prices where appropriate.
These prices are derived from the median of annual price assumptions as reported by various analysts during Q1 2010.
ENRCs forecasts used to support the current Ore Reserve declarations are: Chromite at US$257 tonne and HCFeCr at US102.5 lb.
Manganese concentrate products between US$62 tonne and US$182 tonne and iron-manganese concentrate products at US$33 tonne.
Iron concentrate prices have been based on SRKs CMF price of US$0.85 dmtu dry metric tonne units.
Iron ore at US$1.12 dmtu for pellets, US$0.85 dmtu for concentrates, and US$355 tonne for HBI briquettes.
SRK has relied on ENRC and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to SRK is accurate.
A detailed information request list was submitted by SRK and ENRC provided data during January and February 2010.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements for 31 December 2009 are based on the following assumptions, assessments, recommendations and material changes: Ferroalloys Division Kazchrome Donskoy GOK In 2009 the group produced 4.3 Mt of ore. Molodezhnaya underground mine produced 2.5 Mt and has a mine life of 16 years, producing between 2.2 and 2.5 Mtpa for the next 10 years.
10th Anniversary underground mine produced 1.6 Mt and has a mine life of 39 years, with an average 2.5 Mtpa from Phase 1.
The deeper Phase 2 commences production in 2021, where production builds up to around 5.5 Mtpa in 2036.
Yuzhniy open pit mined 0.2 Mt and is due to produce 2.9 Mtpa ore between 2013 and 2018.
However, approximately 80 Mt of waste are planned to be stripped within the next five to eight years, which represents an unusually high stripping ratio of 28:1 t waste:t ore. A significant portion of the Ore Reserve is dependent on successful application of new mining methods for both near surface and deposits at depth.
Whilst studies have been carried out for these, the methods have not been trialled and will be at a higher cost than the current method.
The investment required to sustain the current operations and to provide for planned expansions and improvements at the 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter, have been adequately allowed for.
The Mineral Resource has marginally decreased in line with depletion from the 2009 production.
The Ore Reserves for Yuzhniy and Molodezhnaya have not materially changed.
However, the Ore Reserves for the 10th Anniversary mine have increased due to an increase in the mine life from 2041 to 2048.
Kazmarganets The Ore Reserve for Tur is based on a Life of Mine Plan ending in 2020.
The current mining Contract for Tur expires on 7 October 2021.
The Vostochny Kamys Ore Reserve is based on a Life of Mine Plan ending in 2012.
The current mining Contract for Vostochny Kamys expires on 28 June 2018.
No operational changes are planned for.
Kazmarganets product is consumed by the Aksu smelter.
Hence, the Ore Reserve has been reported on an integrated Kazchrome company basis, adopting the same approach as for Donskoy.
Overall comment on Kazchrome The production levels planned for the mines, process plants and smelters, and the respective operating costs, are considered to be realistic.
The 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter have substantial expansion plans and these appear to have been adequately investigated, planned and costed.
The Ore Reserves for Donskoy and Kazmarganets are supported by the overall profitability of Kazchrome.
Whilst minor recommendations have been made to ENRC, SRK finds all other requirements to be in place, including the mining Contracts.
CORPORATE INFORMATION RESERVES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW GROUP OVERVIEW ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 116 Reserves Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 Zhairemsky GOK The 2009 period has resulted in a marginal decrease of Mineral Resources 1.7 Mt and Ore Reserves 1.2 Mt from mining activities and stockpile depletion.
SRK recognises that the long-term demand and commodity price forecasts of the various products should allow production to increase in the near future.
The current mining Contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Zhomart in June 2013.
The Reserves for the Zhairem deposit are based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2024.
SRK has declared the Reserves on the understanding that Zhairemsky GOK can extend these licences under similar terms for periods that match their Life of Mine plans.
Iron Ore Division SSGPO In 2009 SSGPO produced 36.6 Mt of iron ore at 32.5% iron, from four open pits and one underground mine.
The current mining Contract expires in May 2015.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the assumption that SSGPO will apply for, and be granted, at least one 25-year extension of this Contract until 2040 under similar terms and conditions.
The Ore Reserves are based on an overall Life of Mine plan for SSGPO until 2040.
The Mineral Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2040.
Aluminium Division AoK In 2009 the two divisions of AoK produced 5.1 Mt of bauxite, 4.8 Mt from 13 operating open pits in four areas of KBRU and 0.36 Mt from four operating open pits of TBRU.
All mining Contracts expire on 21 January 2017, with the exception of the mining licence for VostochnoAyatskoye, which expires on 26 July 2031.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that AoK can extend these licences under similar terms for periods that match their Life of Mine plans.
The Ore Reserves are based on an overall Life of Mine Plan for AoK to the end of 2046.
SRK notes that the economic viability of TBRU is dependent on the production from KBRU.
Energy Division EEC Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine produced 20 Mt coal in 2009.
The current mining Contract expires on 18 March 2022.
The Coal Reserves are based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2045 and on the understanding that EEC can extend the Contract under similar terms for a period that matches the Life of Mine plan.
The Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2045.
