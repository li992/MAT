co. uk NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION 1.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The Company-only financial statements of Cookson Group plc the Company, a company registered in the United Kingdom, are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
A separate Company-only profit and loss account has not been presented, as permitted by Section 408 4 of the Companies Act 2006.
1.2 BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS Information on the business environment in which Cookson Group plc and its subsidiaries the Group operates, including the factors that are likely to impact the future prospects of the Group, are included in the Chief Executives Report on pages 9 and 10 and the Operating Review on pages 14 to 23.
The principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces throughout its global operations are included in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 38 to 41.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and debt facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 24 to 29.
In addition, notes 4 and 38 to the consolidated financial statements set out the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: financial risks: financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit, market both currency and interest rate-related and liquidity risk.
Further details of the Groups cash balances and borrowings are included in notes 20 and 37 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has two committed debt facilities, approximately 680m of syndicated bank facilities and approximately 200m of US Private Placement loan notes.
Of the latter, approximately 84m matures in May 2010.
Of the remaining total facilities, of approximately 796m, the principal maturities are due in 2011 and 2012.
The Groups debt facilities contain a number of financial covenants with which the Group is required to comply and with which it was fully in compliance as at 31 December 2009.
In March 2009, the Group completed a rights issue which raised proceeds net of expenses of 241m which were used to repay gross borrowings, significantly strengthening the Companys and the Groups financial position.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements.
These forecasts reflect an assessment of current end-market conditions, their impact on the Groups future trading performance and the actions taken by management in response to the difficult market conditions.
The forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the financial covenants.
In addition, management has considered various mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that end-market conditions are worse than their current assessment.
Such measures include reductions in costs, reductions in capital expenditure and reductions in those items of working capital within managements control.
On the basis of the exercise as described above and the available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in relation to the Company-only financial statements.
2.1 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
122 COOKSON GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the BlackScholes model.
2.3 PENSION COSTS The Company participates in a UK-wide Group pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.4 POST-RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan.
The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not funded and the amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method.
2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
2.6 BORROWING COSTS Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
2.7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.8 INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES Shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment in value.
2.9 PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.

As at 31 December 2009, the number of ordinary shares of 100p each of the Company so held in trust was 0.2m, having an aggegate nominal value of 0.2m, which were purchased at a gross cost of 2.6m.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 17.1 PENSION PLANS The Company participates in a UK-wide Group defined benefit pension scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and therefore accounts for its membership of the scheme as it would for a defined contribution scheme.
Costs charged in the year in respect of its contributions payable to the scheme were 3.7m 2008: 23.4m.
The pension scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme reach retirement.
The last full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out as at 31 December 2006.
At that date, the market value of the plan assets was 278.3m, representing 78% of accrued plan benefits at the time using the projected unit method of valuation of 356.6m.
Calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 475.7m, representing a funding level of 59%.
The 2006 full valuation has been updated, as appropriate, in order to estimate the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2009, at which date the market value of the plan assets was 404.1m 2008: 406.3m, representing 95% 2008: 120% of estimated accrued plan benefits of 426.4m 2008: 337.6m.
As announced on 2 March 2010, employees are being consulted regarding the proposed closure of the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual with effect from 31 July 2010.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to 0.1m 2008: 0.1m.
There were no outstanding contributions payable to the scheme as at 31 December 2009 31 December 2008: nil.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED 17.2 POST-EMPLOYMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS The Company operates a postretirement healthcare benefits plan.
The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not funded.
The level of the accrued plan benefits provision is based on independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of the plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out at 31 December 2009, at which date the accrued plan benefits were 2.0m 2008: 1.2m: 2007: 1.3m: 2006: 3.8m: 2005: 4.9m.

The exercise prices shown in the following tables are the weighted average exercise prices.
The number of options and the associated share prices in the tables below have been restated to reflect the bonus element of the shares issued under the terms of the rights issue which completed on 4 March 2009 and the 10 for 1 share consolidation completed on 14 May 2009.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2009 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to 32.5m 31 December 2008: 66.9m, which includes guarantees under property leases of discontinued operations amounting to 3.9m 31 December 2008: 4.3m.
