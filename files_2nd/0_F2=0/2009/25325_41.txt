International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Financial Assets loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost.
They are initially recognised at fair value upon acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method allocates the interest income over the relevant period by applying the effective interest rate to the carrying amount of the asset.
The average effective interest rate, referred to in note 3, is 8.03% 2008 8.02%.
The income will be recognised over the life of the underlying PFI concessions based on this effective rate.
Loans and receivables balances include pound sterling denominated loans of 466.0 million 2008 484.9 million and 8.4 million 2008 - 9.4 million denominated in euros.
Cash and cash equivalents There has been a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from 31 December 2009 of 168 million primarily due to an increase in construction activity on Royal Childrens Hospital and Alberta Schools which are financed by structured bond financing arrangements.
Cash includes 802,105,000 2008: 944,567,438 which is held by non-recourse PFI project entities and is restricted.
All cash and cash equivalents are exposed to floating rate interest rate risk.
Bank loans All bank loans including bonds are secured solely on a specific PFI concession and its future income stream with the exception of the corporate debt facility of 100 million provided to the Company at an interest rate of 175 basis points over LIBOR of which 58.3 million was drawn down at 31 December 2009.
This debt facility matures in May 2011 and is secured over all the assets of the Company.
The terms of the PFI concession finance agreements provide that the lender cannot seek in any way to enforce repayment of either principal or interest from the rest of the Group.
For group funding, the financial covenants are in respect of historic and future interest cover ratios and loan to value calculations.
There is significant headroom on all of these covenants.
