They have been valued by J. C. Rathbone Associates Limited by reference to the mid point of the yield curve at the balance sheet date.

The Company is not obliged to redeem any further amounts of the 61.0 million nominal of Stock remaining in issue in advance of its redemption date of 31 March 2024, when repayment of the stock in issue will be at par value.
Other financial instruments The fair values of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings other than the 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024 and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.
Management of financial risk Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash rental deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 14.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the Directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups bankers are set out on page 5.
All The Group holds minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day to day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its commitments and extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Business Review on pages 33 to 34.

SHAFTESBURY PLC | | NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2009 69 Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long term, fixed rate debt, long term committed bank facilities and the use of long term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
As described in the Business Review on pages 33 to 34, the Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
The Groups First Mortgage Debenture Stock carries a rate of interest of 8.5%, which is fixed until maturity in March 2024.
The Groups current bank facilities, which expire between April 2016 and March 2021, are at credit margins which are fixed for the life of the facilities.
At 30 September, the actual average credit margin on the amounts drawn under those facilities was 0.71%.
If those facilities had been fully drawn at that date, the average credit margin payable would have been 0.81%.
The Group has in place interest rate swaps to hedge 360 million of floating rate bank debt, at a weighted average rate at the year end of 4.71% excluding margin.
The weighted average rate rises to 4.87% from December 2009, following the expiry of certain short term settlement arrangements.
The swaps, which are settled against three month LIBOR, expire between December 2027 and November 2038 weighted average maturity 23.4 years.
