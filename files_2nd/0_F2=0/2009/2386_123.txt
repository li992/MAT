The share-based payment plans that existed during the year are detailed below.
All plans are ongoing unless otherwise stated.
Plans for executive directors Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP share element An equity-settled incentive plan for executive directors with a three-year performance period.
For share plan performance periods 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 the award of shares is determined by comparing BPs total shareholder return TSR against the other oil majors ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron.
For the performance period 2009-2011 the award of shares is determined 50% on TSR versus a competitor group of oil majors which in this period also included ConocoPhillips and 50% on a balanced scorecard BSC of three underlying performance measures versus the same competitor group.
After the performance period, the shares that vest net of tax are then subject to a three-year retention period.
The directors remuneration report on pages 81 to 92 includes full details of the plan.
Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP share option element An equity-settled share option plan for executive directors that permits options to be granted at an exercise price no lower than the market price of a share on the date that the option is granted.
The options are exercisable up to the seventh anniversary of the grant date and the last grants were made in 2004.
From 2005 onwards the remuneration committees policy is not to make further grants of share options to executive directors.
Plans for senior employees The group operates a number of equity-settled share plans under which share units are granted to its senior leaders and certain employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment during the three-year period will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply where the participant leaves for a qualifying reason.
Grants are settled in cash where participants are located in a country whose regulatory environment prohibits the holding of BP shares.
Performance unit plans The number of units granted is made by reference to level of seniority of the employees.
The number of units converted to shares is determined by reference to performance measures over the three-year performance period.
The main performance measure used is BPs TSR compared against the other oil majors.
In addition, free cash flow FCF is used as a performance measure for one of the performance plans.
Plans included in this category are the Competitive Performance Plan CPP, the Medium Term Performance Plan MTPP and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Restricted share unit plans Share unit grants under BPs restricted plans typically take into account the employees performance in either the current or the prior year, track record of delivery, business and leadership skills and long-term potential.
One restricted share unit plan used in special circumstances for senior employees, such as recruitment and retention, normally has no performance conditions.
Plans included in this category are the Executive Performance Plan EPP, the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
BP Share Option Plan BPSOP Share options with an exercise price equivalent to the market price of a share immediately preceding the date of grant were granted to participants annually until 2006.
There were no performance conditions and the options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.

Share-based payments continued Savings and matching plans BP ShareSave Plan This is a savings-related share option plan under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three-or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
The plan is run in the UK and options are granted annually, usually in June.
Participants leaving for a qualifying reason have six months in which to use their savings to exercise their options on a prorated basis.
BP ShareMatch Plans These are matching share plans under which BP matches employees own contributions of shares up to a predetermined limit.
The plans are run in the UK and in more than 70 other countries.
The UK plan is run on a monthly basis with shares being held in trust for five years before they can be released free of any income tax and national insurance liability.
In other countries the plan is run on an annual basis with shares being held in trust for three years.
The plan is operated on a cash basis in those countries where there are regulatory restrictions preventing the holding of BP shares.
When the employee leaves BP all shares must be removed from trust and units under the plan operated on a cash basis must be encashed.
Local plans In some countries BP provides local scheme benefits, the rules and qualifications for which vary according to local circumstances.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the BP share plans as required.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards and are funded by the group.
Until such time as the companys own shares held by the ESOP trusts vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders equity see Note 8.
Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.
At December 2009 the ESOPs held 18,062,246 shares 2008 29,051,082 shares and 2007 6,448,838 shares for potential future awards, which had a market value of $174 million 2008 $220 million and 2007 $79 million.
For the options outstanding at 31 December 2009, the exercise price ranges and weighted average remaining contractual lives are shown below.

The model uses the implied volatility of ordinary share price for the quarter within which the grant date of the relevant plan falls.
The fair value is adjusted for the expected rates of early cancellation.
Management is responsible for all inputs and assumptions in relation to the model, including the determination of expected volatility.

The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of the TSR element of the 2009, 2008 and 2007 CPP, PSP, MTPP and EDIP plans.
In accordance with the rules of the plans the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against our principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historic dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
