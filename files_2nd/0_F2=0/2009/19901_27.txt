UNITE Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 53 1.
Significant accounting policies The UNITE Group plc the Company is a company domiciled in The United Kingdom.
a Basis of preparation The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the company is taking advantage of the exemption in Section s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Going concern The Annual report has been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due, for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts on the basis of which they expect that the Group will continue as a going concern.
These forecasts show that the Group has improved its headroom in covenant compliance and its cash position during the year following the issue of new shares, sales of properties and various cost saving initiatives.
In preparing those forecasts, including incorporating the outcomes of various down-side scenarios, the Directors have taken into account various risks and uncertainties as outlined here and in more detail on the Chairmans Statement and Business Review.
The principle areas of risk and uncertainty are: the impact of further falls in property valuations resulting in breaches of covenants that cannot be avoided by payments from cash resources: and the achievement of operating targets, in particular projected occupancy levels and rental increases.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: Investment property Investment property under development Financial assets and liabilities including interest rate swaps Land and buildings included in property, plant and equipment Joint venture investment loans Accounting standards adopted Included within the IASBs Annual Improvement programme is a change in the accounting treatment for investment properties under development.
These properties are now accounted for under IAS 40, therefore revaluation surpluses and deficits on investment properties under development are recognised in the income statement rather than equity.
Previously development properties were accounted for under IAS16 and revaluations were consequently taken directly to reserves.
This change has been applied to 2009 and in accordance with the requirements of adopted IFRS, the results of the prior periods have not been restated.
An impact of the transition is that the opening balance on the revaluation reserve has been transferred, on 1 January 2009, to retained earnings.
IAS 1 revised requires the presentation of a more detailed statement of changes in equity and statement of comprehensive income as primary statements, separate from the income statement.
As a result, a consolidated statement of comprehensive income and a consolidated statement of changes in equity, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented, have been included in the primary statements.
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2009 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are expected to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group with the exception of the following item: Amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments.
This standard is amended such that gains or losses on a hedged instrument should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss during the period that the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss.
This amendment will apply to the Group from the accounting period commencing 1 January 2010.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.

Significant accounting policies continued Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which are as follows: Valuation of investment property and investment property under development The Group uses the valuation performed by its independent valuers as the fair value of its investment properties.
The valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs and the appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Valuations and current market conditions are discussed further in the Business Review.
Completed property, properties under development and inventories Completed property, properties under development and inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
However the valuation of completed property and properties under development is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements and the same factors affecting investment properties as described above apply.
These properties are also valued by the independent valuers.
Trade and other receivables The Group is required to judge when there is sufficient objective evidence to require the impairment of individual trade and other receivables.
Classification of properties acquired All properties acquired that are intended for development as student accommodation have been classified as in current assets as, in accordance with the Groups business model, it is intended to sell these assets when completed and stabilised to UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund or another co-investment vehicle.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value is treated as an investment in joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in value of fixed assets.
iv Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the effective date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions is reported in the balance sheet as an intangible asset and is impairment tested annually.
The carrying amount of goodwill is assessed annually and written down to its recoverable amount.
The profit or loss on disposal of assets is calculated by reference to the carrying value at the date of disposal, including the attributable amount of goodwill which remains unimpaired.
UNITE UNITE Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 55 1.
Significant accounting policies continued c Financial instruments i Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with movements recognised in the income statement except where cash flow hedge accounting is applied see below.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
ii Hedge accounting for interest rate swaps Where an interest rate swap is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of an existing or highly probable forecast loan interest payment, the effective part of any valuation gain or loss on the swap instrument is recognised directly in equity in the hedging reserve.
The cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
d Investment property Investment properties are those held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are stated at fair value.
External, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification, value the portfolio every six months.
The fair values are based on the market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The valuations are prepared by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable from the properties and where relevant, associated costs.
Valuations reflect, where appropriate, the type of tenants actually in occupation or responsible for meeting lease commitments or likely to be in occupation after letting of vacant accommodation and the markets general perception of their credit worthiness: the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between lessor and lessee: and the remaining economic life of the property.
It has been assumed that whenever rent reviews or lease renewals are pending with anticipated reversionary increases, all notices and where appropriate counter notices have been served validly and within the appropriate time.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Rental income is accounted for as described in accounting policy o.
Investment properties held under operating leases are not included in assets.
e Investment property under development Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property is classified as investment property under development, whereas properties purchased with the intention of selling them to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund are classified as property under development see i below.
Investment property under development is stated at fair value.
The fair values are on the same basis as those used for investment properties but include adjustments to remove the fair value of construction, which has yet to take place and making reasonable assumptions regarding expected rentals and costs.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 6.7% 2008: 6.9%.

Significant accounting policies continued f Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Other than land and buildings, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Land and buildings held in property, plant and equipment are stated at fair value.
The valuation has been carried out by an external, independent valuer, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
ii Leased assets Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Property held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases is classified as investment property and carried at fair value see accounting policy d. iii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of life of lease and economic life Fixtures and fittings 4 years Motor vehicles 4 years Plant & equipment 420 years Assets held under finance leases which do not transfer title of the assets to the Group at the end of the lease, are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives shown above and the term of the lease.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
g Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures The treatment of these investments in the Groups consolidated financial statements is set out in the basis of preparation section above.
In the financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are carried at fair value with movements in fair value being recognised directly in equity.
h Intangible assets Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The Groups development costs relate to designs and processes at the Groups manufacturing facility.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use over the following periods: Development cost 45 years Computer software 45 years UNITE UNITE Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 57 1.
Significant accounting policies continued i Completed property, property under development and inventories Completed properties and properties under development are properties purchased with the intention of selling them to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund following completion.
These properties and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Costs are arrived at in the same way as used for investment property under development see Note e above.
Inventories include land held for development, which are sites, purchased without planning permission.
Once planning permission is obtained the assets transfer to either property under development or investment property under development.
j Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted as appropriate.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Share capital i Ordinary share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination, are shown as a deduction, net of tax, in equity from the proceeds.
Share issue costs incurred directly in connection with a business combination are deducted from the proceeds of the issue.
ii Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are declared.
m Interest bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
n Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The groups share option schemes allow employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options that are expected to vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
When the options are exercised, equity is increased by the amount of the proceeds received.
The Group funds the purchase of its own shares by the Employee share ownership trust to meet the obligations of the Long term incentive plan LTIP and executive bonus scheme.
The purchases are shown as Own shares acquired in the retained earnings in Note 17.
Financial statements 4691 UNITE UNITE Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 58 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued o Revenue i Rental income Rental income from investment property leased out under operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the period to the first break clause or over the term of the lease where no break clause exists.
ii Management and promote fees Management and promote fees are recognised, in line with the property management contracts, in the period to which they relate.
The Group can earn promote fees relative to criteria specified in the joint venture agreements.
iii Property sales In addition to development management fees, detailed above, income relating to the sale of trading properties is recognised once contracts for sale have been unconditionally exchanged.
iv Manufacturing revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
p Expenses i Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the property interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised.
ii Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested both calculated using the effective interest rate method and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement refer accounting policy c. q Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax provision in respect of property assets is calculated on the basis that assets will not be held indefinitely and therefore takes account of available indexation.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Segment reporting Segment information for the Group is presented in respect of the Groups business segments based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
The Group undertakes its Development and Investment activities directly and in joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and have similar economic and other characteristics to the Groups direct activities.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis and is reported excluding mark to market and valuation movements.
The Directors do not consider that the group has meaningful geographical segments as it operated exclusively in the United Kingdom in the year.
The Groups Development segment undertakes the acquisition and development of properties, including the manufacture and sale of modular building components to practical completion.
Many of the Groups properties are acquired with a view to a future sale to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund.
The Development segments revenue predominantly comprises the sales proceeds of properties, including those sold to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund: it also includes revenue from the sale of modules to third parties and joint ventures, and development management fees earned from joint ventures.
The Investment segment comprises the asset and property management of completed properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from net rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.

Investment property and investment property under development are carried at fair value.
Property under development of 38.907 million 2008: 249.124 million and Completed property of 204.113 million 2008: 75.214 million held in current assets are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, but their fair values have been determined as described below.
Following the formation of the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund it is likely that the fund will acquire the Groups future developments.
Hence properties acquired with the intention of selling them to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund following completion are treated as property under development in current assets, carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, rather than fixed assets, carried at fair value.
The impact if these properties were carried at fair value rather than cost is set out in the table below: At 31 December 2009 property under development comprised entirely of properties where planning has been obtained but the development process has not yet reached the construction stage.

Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures Group Reclassification of joint venture loans and investments The Group finances its joint ventures through a mixture of interest free loans and capital contributions.
The group has reclassified certain of the loans and capital contributions it makes to its joint ventures from current other receivables to non-current asset joint venture investment loans and investment in joint ventures to reflect their respective terms.
All partners finance the joint ventures on the same terms, hence the finance income now arising on these receivables equals the increase in the share of joint venture loss.
This adjustment therefore has no effect on the result for the year or net assets.
The amounts reclassified from current other receivables 2008: 51.913 million and 2007: 45.645 million have been taken to joint venture investment loans 2008: 2.157 million and 2007: 1.961 million and investment in joint ventures 2008: 49.756 million and 2007: 43.684 million.
The Group and the Company have also now discounted the joint venture loans already held as non-current other receivables, of 3.667 million in 2008 and 2007 reducing those amounts by 207,000 and 521,000 in those years respectively and increasing the investment in joint ventures by the same amount.
These loans are now amalgamated with the other reclassified receivables in joint venture investment loans.
The unwinding of the discount on the interest free loans has increased the Groups finance income in 2008 by 334,000.
As noted above this is offset by an increase in the share of joint venture loss and so has no effect on the result for the year.
The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures at fair value with changes being taken to reserves, consequentially the unwinding of the discount has caused the Companys loss for 2008 to be reduced by 315,000.
As a result of these reclassifications restated balance sheets for 2007 have been presented as required by IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

Employee benefits Share-based payments The UNITE Group plc operates the following schemes: two executive share option schemes the Approved Scheme and the Unapproved Scheme, an executive Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP, a Save As You Earn scheme the SAYE scheme and an Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
Details of the two executive schemes and share options held by directors are detailed in the Directors remuneration report.
The SAYE scheme issues options to employees with vesting periods of three to five years.
The only condition attaching to this scheme is a service condition.
The ESOT is used to award part of Directors and senior managers bonuses in shares.
These shares vest after thee years continued service.

Fair value of share options and assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share options granted after 7 November 2002 is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
Service conditions and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement.
The estimates of the fair value of the share options granted is measured based on the following models: Option scheme Model Used Reason for model used Unapproved and approved share option Monte Carlo simulations combined Monte Carlo simulations used to model schemes, LTIP TSR component with binomial lattice FTSE comparator groups for TSR performance condition combined with for share options binomial lattice to incorporate seven-year exercise window SAYE share option scheme Black-Scholes Service condition only, short exercise window makes a fixed date model appropriate ESOT bonus awards, LTIP NAV Discounted share price at grant Awards equates to a gift of free shares with component a performance service condition.

Financial Instruments The Group holds or issues financial instruments for two main purposes: To finance the development and subsequent retention of investment properties: To manage the interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables arise from the Groups operations.
All financial instruments are sterling denominated.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or derivatives.
The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and fresh issues of equity.
The Group borrows from major banking institutions primarily at fixed rates of interest, using derivatives where appropriate to generate the desired effective interest rate basis.
The derivatives used for this purpose are interest rate swaps and caps.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and market price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, they are discussed in the Business Review and are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits are managed by using interest rate swaps, caps and in some cases, simple fixed rate borrowing.
The Groups policy is separated into three areas: i Development finance After taking account of interest rate swaps, none of the Groups development borrowing at 31 December 2009 is fixed.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
ii Refinancing risk The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates, which affect the quantum of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups capital recycling strategy.
The Group manages this risk via a programme of pre-hedging, through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2009 approximately 17.5 million 2008: 65.4 million of the Groups anticipated refinancing was hedged for an average term of 4.7 years 2008: 5.7 years.
iii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under floating rate arrangements.
The majority of this debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2009, the Groups policy has been to hedge in excess of 50% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 215 years.
At 31 December 2009, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 75% 2008: 87% of the Groups medium and long-term borrowing on completed properties was held at fixed rates.
This is fixed at an average rate of 6.7% 2008: 6.2% for an average period of 4 years 2008: 4 years.
Liquidity risk With respect to its development activities, the Directors have adopted a policy whereby the Group injects substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt under associated facilities.
In this way, the funding requirements of each scheme are substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
Some of the Groups banking facilities contain loan to value covenants, which if property values fall far enough may require some debt to be repaid.
This position is closely monitored on a regular basis and the Group develops strategies that will minimise the impact of any such repayments on other operations.
Some of the Groups medium-term banking facilities are revolving, allowing the Group to apply its cash surpluses in the temporary reduction of its debt obligations.
Market risk The Groups primary market risk is interest rate exposure.
It monitors this exposure through a process of sensitivity analysis, estimating the effect on operating cash flow over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2009, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups loss before tax by approximately 0.9 million 2008: 0.9 million, Effective and ineffective interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.

Financial Instruments continued Capital management The Groups financing strategy is based around its developer and co-investing manager business model, which allows capital from stabilised developments sold to UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund to be recycled into new schemes.
The Board has adopted this business model to achieve an appropriate balance between the capital deployed in mature, lower return investment and higher yielding development opportunities.
The Board regularly reviews the capital available to the business with a view to ensuring that the Group has an appropriate capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and sustain the future development of the business.
The Board has processes in place to ensure capital is only committed to new schemes, for site purchase or build, when there is sufficient capital available.
These processes also ensure that capital is allocated to the opportunities offering the greatest return.
The Group regards its available capital as the amount of its adjusted net assets, as this excludes deferred tax and the fair value of financial instruments, which will not be crystallised in the normal course of trade and includes all property assets at market value.
At 31 December 2009 capital on this basis amounted to 423 million 2008: 406 million.
The Group seeks to manage its adjusted gearing, which is based on this capital base, in a range of 100% to 120%.
