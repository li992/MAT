Value in Use calculations: Aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each cash generating unit CGU by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 m m UK 21.2 27.5 Western Continental Europe 7.0 6.6 Eastern Continental Europe 1.5 1.9 30 June 29.7 36.0 Principal CGUs in UK are Darcy 3.8 million 2008: 3.8m, Sanmex Household liquids 6.4 million 2008: 6.4m and Air care business 6.4 million 2008: 6.4m and in Western Continental Europe, Dasty 6.7 million 2008: 6.2m.
Using the Dasty business as an example as it has the greatest impact from changes in sensitivities: the cash flows for this CGU were based on the latest budget for the financial year to June 2010 and for a further four years revenues were assumed to remain constant.
Direct and indirect costs were inflated by 2.0% per annum and the cash flows were then discounted back at 10%.
For the goodwill to suffer impairment either the discount rate would have to increase to 21% or volumes would have to reduce by 2% per annum for each of the four years.
Similarly for the combined Air care business the cash flows for this CGU were based on the latest budget for the financial year to June 2010 and a further four years were extrapolated using revenue growth rates based upon UK market data from Euromonitor 2.4% growth.
Raw material costs were inflated by 2.3% per annum and direct and indirect costs were inflated by 1.5% per annum to reflect managements best estimate of short to long-term changes in input costs.
The cash flows were then discounted back at 12% on managements estimate of the risk on specific product and geographic market of the CGU.
For the goodwill to suffer impairment either the discount rate would have to increase to 45% or volumes would have to fall by 9% from the base assumptions.
The same approach has been applied to the other CGUs but the actual assumptions used were tailored to their specific circumstances.
In the opinion of the directors, the assumptions or judgements used in determining the recoverable amount used in testing goodwill for impairment are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future so as to reduce the recoverable amount of any of the group of units indicated above below their carrying value.
