Exceptional items relating to restructuring costs included pension curtailment costs arising as a result of redundancies of 1m 2008: 1m, and other business reorganisation costs.
ii Pension deficit charges arise from recovery plan contributions to the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
iii Remeasurements gains on derivative financial instruments comprise gains and losses arising on derivative financial instruments reported in the income statement.
These exclude gains and losses for which hedge accounting has been effective, which have been recognised directly in equity or offset by adjustments to the carrying value of debt.
iv The exceptional tax credit in the year arose from a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% included in the Finance Act 2007.
This resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities.
v The exceptional tax charge in the period arose from changes to the industrial buildings allowances IBAs in the 2008 Finance Act.
This resulted in a increase in deferred tax liabilities.

Pensions Substantially all of NGGs employees are members of the defined benefit section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to NGG.
Accordingly, NGG accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
For further details regarding the nature and terms of the scheme and the actuarial assumptions used to value the assets and pension obligations, refer to note 25.
The following disclosures relate to the scheme as a whole and include amounts not recognised in these regulatory accounting statements, but which are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of National Grid plc.

Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charge A number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the April 2009 Budget Statement which are expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2009.
The changes announced to the UK Corporation Tax system include temporary changes to the capital allowances regime and the introduction of a system for taxing foreign profits, which is expected to bring in a dividend exemption and a worldwide debt cap.
The dividend exemption is likely to be available for both UK and foreign distributions, falling within an exempt classification, received on or after 1 July 2009.
This is not expected to have a material effect on our future tax charge.
The worldwide debt cap is likely to restrict the amount of finance expense available for UK tax purposes, based on the consolidated finance expense, and is expected to apply for the accounting period ended 31 March 2011 onwards.
We are in the process of evaluating the impact the worldwide debt cap will have on our future tax charge.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore any effects on the tax charge have not been included in these financial statements.

Market values, where available, have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The allocated notional amount of allocated borrowings outstanding as at 31 March 2009 was 3,250m 2008: 2,975m.
Collateral is placed with or received from any counterparty where NGG has entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA Master Agreement once the current mark-to-market valuation of the trades between the parties exceeds an agreed threshold.
