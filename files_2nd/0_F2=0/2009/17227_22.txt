The adjustments are made to reported profit to a remove potential income statement volatility within net pension interest: b remove profits arising on property transactions since these profits do not form part of the Groups principal activities: and c normalise the tax charge as required.
In the current period, we have used the actual tax charge as the difference between the actual tax charge and a normalised charge is not significant.
In the prior period, an effective tax rate of 32% was applied, being an estimated normalised tax rate, since the prior periods effective tax rate was considerably lower than the prevailing rate due to the reasons set out in note 6.

7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two 2008: two classes of financial instruments that are potentially dilutive: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period and contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plan.

The fair value of investment properties at the end of the period was 259m 2008: 328m.
This valuation has been determined by the Directors based on market comparable information being rent and market rental yield.
This reduction in the fair value is due to an increase in market rental yield driven by the deteriorating market conditions.

The expiry date for the floating credit facility is consistent with the undrawn element of the facility disclosed below.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, the principal amounts and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.

There is an amount of delegated authority to the Treasury Committee, but all activities are summarised in half yearly treasury reports which are presented to the Audit Committee.
The Groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, other borrowings, finance leases and trade and other creditors.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade debtors and cash and short term deposits which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, in the form of forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and diesel and electricity price contracts.
The purpose of these derivative instruments is to manage risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
The financial derivatives relating to commitments entered into during the year are to manage the risks arising from its usage of diesel and electricity.
It remains the Groups policy not to engage in speculative trading of financial instruments.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, which remain unchanged from the prior year are stated below: i Foreign currency risk The Group makes the majority of its purchases in Sterling.
However, it incurs currency exposure in respect of overseas trade purchases made in currencies other than Sterling, primarily the Euro and US dollar.
The Groups objective is to reduce risk to short term profits from exchange rate fluctuations.
It is Group policy that any transactional currency exposures recognised to have a material impact on short term profits will be hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments.
As at the balance sheet date, the Group had entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on up to 50% of its forecasted purchases within the next six months.
Exposure on debt denominated in a foreign currency is fully hedged using cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change 20% in the US dollar Euro exchange rate has been determined as being immaterial.
ii Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain a balance of funding with a range of maturities and a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
Short term cash balances, together with undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group finances its operations with a combination of bank credit facilities and bonds.
The Treasury Committee monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve on a quarterly basis, which comprises committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities on the basis of expected cash flow.
At the year end, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 850m note 17 : these facilities remain available to the Group.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups primary non-current financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, which includes interest payments.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts do not agree to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings.
Where borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate for interest has been taken.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banking groups as well as credit exposures from tenants of investment properties.
The Group maintains deposits with banks and financial institutions with an acceptable credit rating for a period not exceeding six months.
Further, the Group has specified limits that can be deposited with any banking group or financial institution at any point.
The maximum exposure on cash and cash equivalents and deposits is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group does not expect any significant performance losses from counterparties.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that tenants of investment properties who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 14.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
iv Other risk Pricing risk: The Group manages the risks associated with the purchase of electricity, gas and diesel consumed by its activities.
This does not include fuel purchased for resale to customers.
The Treasury Committee reviews the Groups market price exposure to these commodities on a quarterly basis and determines a strategy for utilising derivative financial products in order to mitigate the volatility of the commodity prices.
The Group intends to hold derivatives to maintain cover of its energy purchases of up to 75% over an appropriate timescale.
Cash flow interest rate risk: The Groups long term policy is to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining up to 60% of its consolidated total net debt in fixed rate borrowings over a four year horizon.
As at the balance sheet date, 74% of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rate, thereby substantially mitigating the Groups exposure to adverse movements in interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents is a significant interest-bearing asset held by the Group.
At year end, a 1% movement in interest rates would have had a 2m 2008: 5m impact on the Groups annual finance income.
There are no other significant interest-bearing assets held by the Group.
66 Morrisons Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 1 February 2009 18 Financial instruments continued b Capital management The Groups objectives are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern providing returns to shareholders, through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
The Group has completed a share buyback programme in the period, see note 23.
A key objective of the Groups capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the revolving credit facility.
The Groups policy is to maintain both a gearing ratio and interest cover, which represents headroom of at least 10% over and above the requirements laid down in the revolving credit facility.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with this policy.
There has been no change in the objectives, policies or processes with regards to capital management during the years ended 1 February 2009 and 3 February 2008. c Fair values i Financial assets All financial derivatives are held at fair value which has been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments are traded.
Cash and cash equivalents and Debtors are held at book value which equals the fair value.
The values of the financial assets are disclosed within note 12. ii Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost.
The Euro bonds are retranslated at balance sheet date spot rates.
The fair value of the Sterling and Euro bonds are measured using closing market prices.
These compare to carrying values as follows: 2009 2008 Amortised Fair Amortised Fair cost value cost value m m m m Total Sterling and Euro bonds non-current 784 781 758 693 The fair value of other items within current and non-current borrowing equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
d Hedging activities i Cash flow hedge At 1 February 2009, the Company held a cross-currency swap which has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
This derivative financial instrument is used to minimise risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates inherent in cash flow of certain liabilities.
To minimise the risk from potential movements in commodity prices, the Group has fuel price contracts which are also designated as cash flow hedges.
The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next two years.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 23 on cross-currency swaps as at 1 February 2009 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally once every year over the course of the next two 2008: three years.
ii Forward contracts The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euro and US dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur within one year of the balance sheet date.
At 1 February 2009, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed was 53m 2008: 45m.
The fair value of these outstanding forward exchange contracts at the balance sheet date was 3.4m 2008: 0.2m.

The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2007 and 1 April 2007 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 purposes for the periods to 1 February 2009, 3 February 2008, 4 February 2007 and 29 January 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 2 February 2009 is 44m 2008: 138m, including a special contribution of 100m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation were as follows: i Financial 2009 2008 2007 Rate of increases in salaries 4.75-5.75% 5.00-6.00% 4.45-5.45% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.50% 3.75% 3.20% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.25% 5.75% 5.00% Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.75% 3.20% 68 Morrisons Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 1 February 2009 20 Pensions continued ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Male 23.5 23.5 19.9 Female 25.8 25.8 22.8 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Male 22.2 22.2 19.9 Female 24.7 24.7 22.8 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as Long Cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is PNX00 YOB LC 2008: PNX00 YOB LC and 2007: PA92 C2020.
As disclosed in the critical accounting assumptions on page 51, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway Scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes.
iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00% Corporate bonds 6.00% 6.00% 5.00% Gilts 4.25-4.50% 4.25-4.50% Property-related funds 6.00% 6.00% 6.00% Active currency management assets 5.25% Cash 2.50% 5.50% 5.25% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
c Valuations Assets of the schemes are held in order to generate cash to be used to satisfy the schemes obligations, and are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The allocation of assets between category is governed by the Investment Principles of each scheme and is the responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme.
The trustees should take due consideration of the Groups views and a representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Equities 592 1,040 1,208 Corporate bonds 547 237 221 Gilts 545 531 Property and property-related funds 71 104 260 Active currency management assets 66 Cash 3 27 19 Total fair value of schemes assets 1,758 1,939 1,774 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 1,807 2,007 1,972 Net pension liability recognised in the balance sheet 49 68 198 Related deferred tax asset note 19 14 19 59 Net deficit 35 49 139 Group Company Performance review Strategic review Governance financial statements financial statements Investor information www.

The movement in the present value of the defined benefit obligation during the period was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Defined benefit obligation at start of period 2,007 1,972 1,952 Current service cost 38 44 53 Employee contributions 10 10 11 Interest on defined benefit obligation 113 99 95 Actuarial gain recognised in the SoRIE 324 77 92 Benefits paid 37 41 47 Defined benefit obligation at end of period 1,807 2,007 1,972 The cost of buying out pension benefits with an insurer was estimated in the recent actuarial valuations to be 2,300m at April 2007, versus assets of 1,939m at February 2008.
This is a deficit of 361m or solvency funding ratio of 84%.
The cost of providing pensions equivalent to the level of compensation paid by the Pension Protection Fund was estimated to be 1,633m at April 2007, compared with assets of 1,939m at February 2008.
This is a Pension Protection Fund surplus of 306m or a funding ratio of 119%.

In June 2001 the Company established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Company makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Stakeholder pension scheme 3 3 1 Life assurance scheme 1 1 1 Total costs 4 4 2 Property 21 Provisions Restructuring provisions Total m m m At 3 February 2008 29 110 139 Charged to the income statement 5 5 Unused amounts reversed during the period 8 8 Utilised in period 21 9 30 Unwinding of discount 66 At 1 February 2009 112 112 a Restructuring The restructuring of the Groups distribution centres, begun in 2006, concluded in the year.
The original provision made, of 75m, was not fully utilised and an unspent balance of 8m was therefore reversed in the period.
The remaining provision at the start of the year, relating to the Groups change in corporate logo, was fully utilised in the year.
b Property provisions Property provisions comprise onerous leases provision, petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from 1 to 65 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
As noted in the financial review, adjustments have been made to reflect the change in market conditions and the legislative changes in respect of rates charges for empty properties.
Other property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost.
Provision is made for decommissioning costs for when the petrol filling station tanks reach the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition in which it was originally leased.
Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.

a Share option schemes i Executive share option scheme In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005.
The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and 10 years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.

Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date providing the relevant performance criteria have been met.
Employees have six months from the vesting date to exercise their options after which they lapse.
The fair value at the date of grant, which is being charged to the income statement over the three year vesting period, has been calculated based on the following assumptions: Grant date 14 Oct 2008 14 Apr 2008 24 Oct 2007 6 Jun 2007 24 May 2007 Share price at grant date 2.42 2.77 2.88 3.13 3.23 Assumed leavers 5% 5% 4% 3% 3% Performance criteria achieved 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% Exercise price nil nil nil nil nil Fair value of options granted 0.6m 12.5m 0.4m 0.1m 10.5m 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise price in Options price in Options per share thousands per share thousands Movement in outstanding share awards Outstanding at start of period 4,470 Granted 6,128 4,470 Expired Outstanding at end of period 10,598 4,470 Exercisable at end of period 2009 2008 Share awards outstanding at the end of the period Range of exercise prices Weighted average remaining contractual life 1.8 years 2.4 years 27 Operating lease arrangements a Lessee arrangements The Group has outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2009 2008 Vehicles, Vehicles, plant and plant and Property equipment Property equipment m m m m Within one year 33 8 34 10 More than one year and less than five years 125 19 127 26 After five years 422 427 580 27 588 36 The Group leases various offices, stores and warehouses under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.

Morrisons was accused in relation to one infringement in 2002, and has vigorously denied this.
Based on the evidence put forward, the Board does not consider it probable that the Company will ultimately incur a fine and, accordingly, the Company has made no provision for any such liability.
The OFT have also raised a legal issue regarding the sale of tobacco and whether established industry practices represented a breach of competition law.
It is likely that this can only be settled through a formal judicial process.
The Board has not made a provision for such a liability.
29 Post-balance sheet events The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 1 February 2009 of 5.0p per share which will absorb an estimated 131m of shareholders funds.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, it will be paid on 10 June 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 8 May 2009.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend.
The Group have entered into further commodity price contracts since the period end to reduce the Groups exposure to pricing risk arising on the volatility of commodity prices purchased for the Groups own consumption.
