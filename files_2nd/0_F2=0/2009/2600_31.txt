K. Thomas, a distributor of foodservice products to the catering and airline sectors within the UK, both acquired on 19 March 2009.
The total cost of acquisitions made in 2009 was 6.4m.
Acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
All acquisitions in 2009 involved the purchase of 100% of the acquirees share capital or, as the case may be, the relevant assets of the businesses acquired.
Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At the end of the year, the allocation period for the acquisitions completed during 2009 remained open for all acquisitions and accordingly the fair values at 31 December 2009 are provisional.
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The net impact on acquired net assets reported in 2008 from these adjustments was 1.8m.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2008 has not been restated for these adjustments as they are not material.
The consideration for the acquisitions has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as intangible assets.
The identified intangible assets principally relate to the acquired businesses customer relationships.
Goodwill arising relates to the potential synergies that can be derived following acquisition and the value inherent in the workforces of the acquired businesses.
