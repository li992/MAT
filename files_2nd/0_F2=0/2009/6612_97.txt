7 Major restructuring programme In October 2007, GSK announced a significant new Operational Excellence programme to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its operations.
A significant expansion of the Operational Excellence programme was approved by the Board and announced in February 2009.
A further expansion was approved by the Board and announced in February 2010.
Total costs for the implementation of the expanded programme are expected to increase from 3.6 billion to approximately 4.5 billion, to be incurred over the period from 2007 to 2012.
Approximately 50% of these costs were incurred by 31st December 2009, and approximately 30% are expected to be incurred in 2010 with the balance mostly in 2011.
In total, approximately 75% of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures and 25% are expected to be asset write-downs.
Uncertainties exist over the exact amount and timing of cash outflows as a result of potential future exchange rate fluctuations and as many elements of the restructuring programme are subject to employee consultation procedures, making it difficult to predict with precision when these procedures will be completed.
However, the majority of the remaining cash payments are expected to be made in 2010 and 2011.
The programme is now estimated to deliver total annual pre-tax savings of up to 2.2 billion by 2012, with savings realised across the business.
Of the total restructuring costs of 832 million incurred in 2009, 761 million was incurred under the Operational Excellence programme in the following areas: the closure of a number of manufacturing sites, including Dartford and Crawley in the UK and Cidra in Puerto Rico, giving rise to asset write-downs and staff reductions: the adoption of more customised sales approaches, leading to staff reductions in a number of sales forces, principally in France: cost saving projects in R&D, focused primarily on the simplification and streamlining of support infrastructure, including some site rationalisations, and projects to simplify or eliminate processes, leading to staff reductions in administrative and support functions.
In addition, costs of 71 million were incurred during the year under the restructuring programme related to the integration of the Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. business in the USA, following its acquisition in July 2009.
