72 | The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8 Goodwill continued During the year, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
As a result, an impairment charge of 6.0 million 2008: nil was made and is shown in other operating expenses in the income statement.
The components of the impairment charge are explained below.
The allocation to reportable segments is as follows: 2009 2008 Impairment Net book amount Impairment Net book amount charge of goodwill charge of goodwill m m m m Textile maintenance UK and Ireland 3.3 36.3 39.7 Textile maintenance Nordic 1.7 244.8 253.7 Textile maintenance Continent 1.0 145.6 159.6 Clinical Solutions and Decontamination 35.0 35.0 Total 6.0 461.7 488.0 The groups goodwill is allocated across 18 cash-generating units CGUs.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates and use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the groups current three-year strategic plan.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period have been generally extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2%2.25% depending upon the CGU and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The main assumptions on which forecast cash flows have been based are revenue and operating margin growth.
The growth rates used are consistent with the long-term average growth rates for the industry.
Projected cash flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates of 11%17% depending upon the CGU 2008: weighted average pre-tax rate of 11%.
The discount rates have been revised to reflect the latest market assumptions for the Risk Free-rates and Equity Risk Premiums and also to take into account the net cost of debt.
Impairment tests are carried out annually, or when indicators show that assets may be impaired.
The groups direct sales businesses have been severely impacted by the recession, primarily in the UK and to a lesser extent in the Nordic and Continent regions.
The annual impairment tests carried out have resulted in a total impairment charge of 6.0 million 2008: nil resulting in the carrying value of goodwill being written down to its recoverable amount.
The German Healthcare business has undergone a significant restructuring in 2008 and 2009.
An impairment review in accordance with the approach and assumptions outlined above has been carried out and no impairment was recognised as the recoverable amount of goodwill and net assets exceeded its carrying value by 13%.
The key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculation are as follows: A small revenue decline from 2009 level is assumed in 2010 with modest growth thereafter.
Following the restructuring programmes implemented in 2008 and efficiency improvements initiatives implemented in 2009, operating margins have grown from 2% in 2008 close to 5% in 2009.
With further efficiency improvements, operating margins are assumed to grow to double digit in the medium term in line with those previously achieved.
If the above assumptions are not achieved then impairment may become necessary.
The goodwill in the Clinical Solutions and Decontamination CGU arose on acquisition of the Inhealth group in 2007.
During the year, we commenced operational service on the two decontamination contracts.
There have been delays in transitioning of service from the six hospital trusts in this start up phase.
The key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculation are as follows: The revenues and volumes in the forecast cash flows are based on existing contracts, transferring full volumes in 2010 and modest growth thereafter.
Achieving a high single digit operating margin in the medium term, although higher margins are targeted for this business.
If the above revenue and volume assumptions are not achieved then impairment may become necessary.
For all other CGUs the main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are revenue and operating margin growth.
Management believe that currently no reasonably possible changes in these assumptions would cause an impairment charge to arise.

The four swaps entered into for this purpose have been designated as cash flow hedges.
In January 2007, the group swapped a further notional principal of 55 million from floating to fixed rates and the two swaps entered into have been designated as cash flow hedges.
In January 2008, a notional principal amount of DKK 400 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
In September 2008, a further notional principal amount of SEK 300 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
The swap entered into has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
80 | The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Derivative financial instruments continued The group has in issue US$509 million and 25 million long term senior guarantee notes under private placements in the US.
In May 2006 the group placed US$250 million at fixed rates for periods between 8 and12 years and in December 2009 the group undertook a further placement of US$259 million and 25 million at fixed rates between 7 and 12 years.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the groups foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at fixed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
Additionally, to reduce the foreign exchange exposure on inter-group cash transactions, the group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for the sale of euros in the future at fixed rates.
All these derivatives are designated cash flow hedges and have a maturity of less than one year.
Cash flow hedges The interest rate swaps have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 8.0 million.
At 31st December 2009 the fixed interest rates vary from 3.11% to 4.54%, the floating euro rate being EURIBOR, the floating Danish krone rate being CIBOR and the floating Swedish krona rate being STIBOR.
The blended rate for the group on this amount is 2.9%.
Of the US$509 million private placements US$459 million was swapped into fixed rates via sterling swaps.
The fixed rate on the US private placements which has been swapped varies from 4.92% to 5.66%.
The derivative asset recognised on these 15 instruments is 17.9 million.
The exchange component of this derivative movement has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 8.9 million loss.
The remaining 20.1 million loss has been taken to the hedging reserve.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative asset of 0.2 million and a liability of 0.3 million 2008: asset 1.1 million.
During the year 0.3 million was recognised in equity and 1.2 million was removed from equity and included in the carrying amount of the textiles and capital equipment purchased with the US dollars.
This equity transfer will then be recognised in the income statement in line with the hedged transaction.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31st December 2009 the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.26% and 5.57% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies against CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The movement on the derivative liability arising has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 6.1 million profit.
The groups borrowings under its revolving credit facilities are designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31st December 2009 was 399.0 million 2008: 425.4 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 25.2 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The swaps used in relation to this hedge have a maturity of between two and five years with no contractual re-pricing.
Fair value hedges US$50 million of the 2006 US private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge resulted in a profit of 119,573 2008: 14,072.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 5.4 million derivative asset.
81 Statements Governance Financial statements Investors 17 Financial risk management 17.1 Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash flow interest rate risk and price risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Finance Director under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Finance Director identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges.
The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2009 and 2008, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31st December 2009 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 15.3 193.6 19.4 15.2 32.8 276.3 Bank overdrafts 2.7 1.3 0.1 4.1 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 15.3 190.9 18.1 15.1 32.8 272.2 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 23.6 232.3 322.4 48.4 120.9 747.6 Finance lease liabilities 5.7 0.2 3.2 0.4 9.5 Pre-derivative position 14.0 41.6 322.4 30.3 109.0 32.4 484.9 Derivative effect 0.1 224.9 322.4 55.4 63.0 20.8 Net debt position 13.9 266.5 85.7 172.0 32.4 505.7 As at 31st December 2008 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 29.9 20.5 32.5 19.2 4.3 106.4 Bank overdrafts 21.5 11.8 0.1 0.5 33.9 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 29.9 1.0 20.7 19.1 3.8 72.5 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 1.2 252.2 177.9 53.8 123.1 605.8 Finance lease liabilities 7.0 0.1 3.0 0.7 10.8 Pre-derivative position 24.1 253.2 177.9 33.2 107.0 3.1 544.1 Derivative effect 0.6 63.9 177.9 54.3 54.1 6.2 Net debt position 24.7 317.1 87.5 161.1 3.1 537.9 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 16.
82 | The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.1 Financial risk factors continued ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities or commodities price risk.
iii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at floating rates.
The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2009 and 2008, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
As at 31st December 2009, the group has the following swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt: 205 million, DKK 400 million and SEK 300 million.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of fixed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2009 2008 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 3.2 3.9 In more than one year, but not more than two years 3.2 3.6 In more than two years but not more than five years 3.3 4.4 In more than five years 348.4 179.3 358.1 191.2 Floating interest rate borrowings 399.0 425.4 Total borrowings 757.1 616.6 During 2009 and 2008, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31st December 2009 As at 31st December 2008 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 180.0 92.2 272.2 72.5 72.5 Borrowings 358.1 399.0 757.1 191.2 425.4 616.6 Pre-derivative position 178.1 306.8 484.9 191.2 352.9 544.1 Derivative effect note i 253.7 233.0 20.7 244.7 249.8 5.1 Net debt position 431.8 73.8 505.6 435.9 103.1 539.0 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account, its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 12 trade receivables.
Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by the counterparties.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31st December 2009 and 31st December 2008, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 428.6 million 2008: 272.1 million.
83 Statements Governance Financial statements Investors 17.1 Financial risk factors continued c Liquidity risk We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom position which is used to demonstrate funding adequacy for periods of 1236 months.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31st December 2009 and 31st December 2008.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not influence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.

The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The group continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.

It is further assumed, where reasonable, that the properties will be able to be sub-let beyond the present sub-let lease agreements.
In determining the vacant property provision, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using the appropriate government bond rates.
Restructuring Restructuring provisions comprise largely of employee termination payments.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Property disposals The group has outstanding warranties, indemnities and guarantees given previously on a number of properties operated by businesses which have been disposed.

Shares in relation to the award will be released to participants at the end of a three-year performance period, dependent upon the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied.
The 2009 award was valued using the Black-Scholes model.
Previous awards were valued using the Monte-Carlo model.
For each award, the group established a comparator group of other companies from the FTSE Mid 250 Investment funds excluded.
The expected volatility under this model was based on the daily movement of total shareholder return over the three years prior to the grant.
The correlation figure shown is the average against all other companies movements in total shareholder return in the comparator group.
The dividend yield was set as zero as the value of dividends can only be awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The awards vest as follows: Performance of total shareholder return: % vesting Below median ranking 0 Median ranking 25 Upper quartile 100 Between median and upper quartile 25% to 100% pro-rata on a straight line basis The Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP awards are conditional on the employee completing two years service from the date of the grant.
The Executive Incentive Plan EIP awards are conditional on the employee achieving relevant, stretching three-year performance targets.
The DBSP and EIP have been valued using the Black-Scholes model.
The remuneration committee approved the grant of a one-off share award to Peter Ventress, who joined as Chief Executive from 1st January 2010.
The share award pursuant to Listing Rule 9.4.
2 2 is an award over the companys shares that, at the time of grant, had the market value of 500,000 and was structured so as to broadly replicate the terms of the incentive awards he forfeited when he resigned from his former employer.
The award is not performance related reflecting the terms of the forfeited award and will vest on17th March 2012.
If however, prior to the vesting of the award, Peter Ventress ceases to be a director or an employee of the company by reason of notice of termination of his employment whether given or received, the award will lapse.

Defined benefit plans Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates a registered defined benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme.
There was a triennial valuation in February 2007.
Overseas, the only significant pension arrangements are the defined benefit scheme operated in Ireland and unfunded schemes within Sweden, Germany and Norway.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall deficit on the funded plans is 9.7 million of which 5.4 million is in respect of the main UK plan.
There is a deficit of 23.2 million on unfunded plans.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other defined benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2009 by qualified actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2009 2008 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.2 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 2.7 Discount rate 5.5 5.9 Inflation rate 3.2 2.7 Expected return on plan assets Equities 8.3 8.0 Bonds 4.8 5.1 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

The objectives of the fund are to hold a diversified basket of assets which is pro-actively changed to avoid the risks of a static portfolio.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
