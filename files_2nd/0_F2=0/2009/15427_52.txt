94 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 31.
Share-based payments continued For share awards with market conditions granted during the current year, the fair value of the awards was determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The inputs into that model were as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 0.38 0.69 Weighted average exercise price nil nil Expected volatility 70% 40% Expected life 3 7 years 3 years Risk free rate 2.8% 4.3% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.9% The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year is 27p 2008: 33p.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the expected term, however due to the exceptional volatility in this financial year we have excluded the period between 1 May 2008 and 31 October 2008 as allowed by IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
The expected life used in the model is based on historical exercise patterns.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1.0m and 6.0m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2009 and 2008 respectively.
In 2008, 1.6m related to the accelerated vesting of share options held by employees of Taylor Woodrow Construction, which was disposed of on 9 September 2008, and which is included in profit from discontinued operations in the income statement.
