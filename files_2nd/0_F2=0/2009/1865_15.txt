This movement in exchange rates has aff ected the comparison with the prior year both for the income statement and the translated value of the net assets and debt on our balance sheet.
The key data for 2008 on the table above is shown as reported and on a constant currency basis for ease of comparison.
Revenue for the year fell by 7%, with our businesses impacted by the diffi cult economic climate.
However, we continued to outperform the market across the majority of our businesses.
Excluding the impact of exchange rates, fuel prices and acquisitions and disposals, the organic revenue decline was 10%, which contrasts with market reductions of 19% in US B&GA activity and 14% in US commercial activity.
Underlying operating profi t of 100.5 million was 8% lower 2008: 109.7 million with the benefi t of cost reduction initiatives, exchange rates and the accelerated sale of engines in ERO which contributed 4.6 million of operating profi t in 2009 largely off setting the impact of reduced activity levels.
At constant exchange rates underlying operating profi t fell by 21%.
Operating margins for the Group were broadly unchanged at 9.3% 2008: 9.5%, although at constant fuel prices, operating margins would have been 8.3%, with the decline related to the organic reduction in activity.
Total operating profi t decreased by 22.4 million due to lower operating profi t and the increased cost of exceptional items which amounted to 18.2 million 2008: 5.0 million.
We took signifi cant action in the second half of 2008 and fi first half of 2009 to address the cost base of the business.
These cost reduction initiatives related primarily to headcount reduction, as well as the tight control of all discretionary spending.
These actions contributed approximately 25 million of savings in 2009 and the incremental benefi t of these savings is expected to be approximately 5 million in 2010.
The key area of focus in 2009 was cash generation and the reduction of net debt.
Free cash fl ow increased substantially to 137.5 million 2008: 77.2 million due principally to a working capital infl ow of 57.9 million 2008: 3.8 million and reduced capital expenditure of 18.7 million 2008: 30.9 million.
The net cash infl ow of 107.2 million benefi ted from reduced dividend payments of 21.9 million 2008: 31.9 million as a result of the level of take up of the scrip alternative.
Net debt was reduced to 391.6 million 2008: 554.4 million including a foreign exchange gain of 55.6 million.
The attention to cost control and debt reduction has ensured that despite the market downturn and lower activity levels, the Groups leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA improved in the year to 2.8 times 2008: 2.9 times.
