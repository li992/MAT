FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED RISKS The Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks as a result of its activities.
These risks include market risk including price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
These risks, which have been applied throughout the year and the Managers policies for managing them are summarised below.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Companys activities expose it primarily to the market risks of changes in market prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from the uncertainty about future prices of the financial instruments held by the underlying hedge funds.
It represents the potential loss the Company may suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
Market risk encompasses the potential for both gains and losses and is affected by three main components: changes in actual market prices, interest rate and foreign currency movements.
Interest rate and foreign currency movement risks are covered elsewhere in this note.
The overall market risk management strategy of each of the holdings of the Company is primarily driven by their respective investment objectives as previously detailed.
The Manager considers the asset allocation of each underlying holding of the Company in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors while continuing to follow their respective investment objective.
It achieves this primarily through the diversication of investments across different hedge fund strategies.
41 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31st March 2009 22.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued Market price risk continued The Investment Manager does not use derivative instruments to hedge the investment portfolios against market risk, as in their opinion the cost of such a process would result in an unacceptable reduction in the potential for capital growth.
The maximum risk resulting from financial instruments is determined by their fair value.
The overall market exposure as at 31st March 2009 is shown in the Balance Sheet.
The Investment Manager believes that analysis of value-at-risk VaR to be an inappropriate measure of market risk in a fund of hedge funds.
Instead, the Investment Manager monitors market risk of the Companys investments via traditional statistical measures, such as correlation and beta.
This is done on a monthly basis.
Beta is an estimate of the Companys response to swings in the market.
A beta of 1 indicates that the Company will be as volatile as the market.
The Companys beta to the MSCI World Equity Index USD and Citigroup WGBI 5 year LCL as at 31st March 2009 and 31st March 2008 was as follows: Beta to MSCI World Equity Index USD 31.3.
2008 Absolute Return Trust Limited 0.23 0.21 If the MSCI World Equity Index USD as at 31st March 2009 had increased by 10% 31st March 2008: 10% with all other variables held constant, the estimated increase in Net Assets attributable to holders of Redeemable Participating Preference Shares would have been US$ 9,064,812 31st March 2008: US$ 10,667,693.
Conversely, if the MSCI World Equity Index USD as at 31st March 2009 had decreased by 10% 31st March 2008: 10% with all other variables held constant, the estimated decrease in Net Assets attributable to holders of Redeemable Participating Preference Shares would have been US$ 9,064,812 31st March 2008: US$ 10,667,693.
The MSCI World Equity Index USD is used as a proxy for World Equity Markets as it is a free oat-adjusted market capitalisation weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from uctuations in the value of a foreign currency.
It represents the potential loss the Company may suffer through holding foreign currency assets in the face of foreign exchange movements.

The Companys Shares are denominated in Sterling a small number are denominated in Euros and its operating expenses are incurred in Sterling, while the Companys investments are denominated in US Dollars.
The Companys presentation currency is Sterling: hence the Balance Sheet may be signicantly affected by movements in the exchange rates between the US Dollar, Euro and Sterling.

As at 31st March 2009, the Company had nine 31st March 2008: five open forward foreign currency contracts.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The below details the Companys sensitivity to a 10% 31st March 2008: 10% change in the Sterling exchange rate against the US Dollars and Euro currencies.
The sensitivity analysis percentages represent managements assessment, based on the foreign exchange rate movements over the relevant year, of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

Interest receivable on bank deposits or payable on bank overdraft will be affected by uctuations in interest rates.
All cash balances are at variable rates.
Increases in interest rates will also increase the borrowing costs of the Company should the uncommitted credit facility be used.
The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as the majority of the Companys financial assets are investments in underlying hedge funds which are non-interest-bearing.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents of the Company are invested at short-term market interest rates.
The Companys continuing position in relation to interest rate risk is monitored on a monthly basis by the Investment Manager as part of its review of the monthly Net Asset Value calculations prepared by the Companys Administrator, Northern Trust International Fund Administration Services Guernsey Limited.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued Interest rate risk continued Interest rate risk prole of financial assets and liabilities: Weighted Greater Average Within 3 than 31.3.
However, no material impact on the Income Statement or Balance Sheet is expected due to the immateriality of interest rates at the year end.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments in a reasonable timeframe or at a reasonable price.
The Company is exposed to the possibility of cash redemptions of Redeemable Participating Preference Shares, subject to the discretion of the Directors, as described in Note 23.
It invests the majority of its assets in collective hedge funds with their own liquidity conditions.
45 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31st March 2009 22.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued Liquidity risk continued The liquidity risk of the Company, which mainly consists of a possible mismatch of liquidity between the conditions offered at the Company level and those proposed by each collective investment fund at the underlying fund level, is carefully monitored by the Investment Manager on a monthly basis.
To minimise liquidity risk the Company has a credit facility in place from its bankers to manage the mark to market exposures and short-term cash ows arising from its currency hedging programme and for other shortterm cash ow management purposes.
The Company may borrow the lower of 20.0 per cent.
of the Net Asset Value of the Company or 40.0 million to meet any liquidity risk that may arise.
The following table details the Companys liquidity analysis for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash ows on the financial assets and liabilities that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash ows on those financial assets and liabilities that require gross settlement.
It includes a provision for the approximate 10.0 per cent.
audit hold back which the underlying funds may apply to full redemptions and any other known restrictions the managers of the underlying funds may place on redemptions.
Where there is currently no rm indication from the underlying manager on the expected timing of the receipt of redemption proceeds, the relevant amount is included in the greater than 12 months category.
The cash ow projections are therefore conservative, but remain estimates.
Restrictions are in the course of being lifted and the information contained in the table above is not an indication of the Companys future liquidity.
