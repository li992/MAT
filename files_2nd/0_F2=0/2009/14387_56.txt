109 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 20 Financial risk management continued The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2009 31 July 2008 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of period 30.3 17.2 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 58.6 47.5 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of period 88.9 30.3 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, a 10% increase in the value of the US dollar while all other market rates remained constant would lead to a fair value loss of 70.8m 2008: 14.9m and a 10% increase in the value of the euro while all other market rates remained constant would lead to a fair value loss of 10.7m 2008: 17.4m.
These movements would be recognised in equity and fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
During the year the Group fide-designated currency swaps which had previously been used to hedge translational currency exposures, and entered into offsetting currency swaps to eliminate any future exchange exposure arising from these contracts.

The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 50% to 80% of the level of net debt.
This is achieved primarilythrough fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2009 79% 2008: 46% of the Groups net borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2009, after interest rate swaps, is 5.8% 2008: 4.6%.

This hedges the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 21.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 149.7m 2008: 75.7m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2009, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 2.2m 2008: 4.3m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
