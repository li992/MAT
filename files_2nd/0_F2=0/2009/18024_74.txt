CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009 20.
Financial risk management Market risk The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Groups operations.
Market risk including interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Risk management is carried out by the LI Group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks: Cash flow interest risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally at fixed rates.
The Groups policy is to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate derivative financial instruments, as discussed in the financial review.
The below table shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the Group borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2009 2009 2008 2008 m m m m Borrowings 64.7 2,742.4 75.0 2,685.4 Derivative impact 2,571.7 2,571.7 2,369.7 2,369.7 Net borrowings profile 2,636.4 170.7 2,444.7 315.7 Interest rate protection on floating debt 93.8% 88.2% The weighted average rate of interest rates contracted through interest rates swaps is 5.3 per cent 2008 5.3 per cent.
