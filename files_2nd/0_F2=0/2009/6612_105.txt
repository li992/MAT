Factors affecting the tax charge in future years As a global organisation there are many factors which could affect the future effective tax rate of the Group.
The mix of profits across different territories, transfer pricing and other disputes with tax authorities and the location of research and development activity can all have a significant impact on the Groups effective tax rate.
Changes to tax legislation in territories where GSK has business operations could also impact the Groups effective tax rate.
The UK tax authorities have proposed some significant changes to the UK taxation system.
In December 2009 the UK Government announced that it intends to introduce a Patent Box regime applying a reduced rate of corporation tax to income from patents.
The changes are expected to have effect from April 2013, following a period of consultation.
The UK Government also continues to consult with business on proposed changes to the Controlled Foreign Company regime.
These changes are expected to be enacted in 2011.
