PEnSIOnS The group principal pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP, has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the BPP was closed on 1 August 2002, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join the defined contribution section of the BPP.
Contributions are paid into the Plan in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary and as outlined in the Schedule of Contributions.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2007 under the Scheme Specific Requirements and as a result, annual contributions of 10.0m in respect of the funding shortfall outlined in the Recovery Plan will continue to be made by 31 December in each of the years 2009 and 2010 in order to eliminate the funding deficit in the Plan.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the income statement for 2009 was 2.9m 2008: 2.0m.
As a result of the acquisition of Britvic Ireland on 29 August 2007, in Northern Ireland the group inherited a further pension scheme in which its employees participated, the C&C Pension Fund.
The name of this scheme has subsequently been changed to the Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP, with employees of C&C Group transferring out on 30 June 2008.
Shortfall correction additional contributions of at least 90,000 per month from April 2007 to December 2015 inclusive are being paid in accordance with the Recovery Plan dated March 2007.
An actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 December 2008, and is still being finalised.
At present, the bulk transfer out of assets for the C&C employees has also to be finalised.
The BNIPP was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
In the Republic of Ireland ROI, employees continued to participate in a number of C&C Group pension funds following the acquisition until transferring into two newly formed pension plans called the Britvic Ireland Defined Contribution Pension Plan and the Britvic Ireland Defined Benefit Pension Plan BIPP on 1 September 2008.
Both Plans are held under trust and operated by Britvic Ireland Pension Trust Limited as trustee.
Since 1 March 2006 under the previous C&C arrangements, and continuing under the new BIPP arrangements, new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution plan in the first instance, with the ability to transfer into the defined benefit plan after a period of 5 years.
The company continues to pay instalments of 200,000 for each monthly pay period relating to the supplementary cost of the reorganisation programme that took place at the end of 2008.
The next actuarial valuation will be carried out at 31 December 2009.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the income statement for 2009 was 0.3m 2008: 0.1m.
All group pension funds are administered by trustees who are independent of the groups finances.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 27 September 2009 by Watson Wyatt BPP and Mercer BIPP and BNIPP.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables known as PA92.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2009 2008 Years Years Years Years Years Years ROI NI GB ROI NI GB Current pensioners at age 65 males 20.7 20.8 20.0 20.7 20.8 19.9 Current pensioners at age 65 females 23.8 23.6 23.0 23.8 23.6 22.8 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 21.8 22.6 21.2 21.8 22.6 21.1 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 24.8 25.1 24.0 24.8 25.1 24.0 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2007 following a mortality investigation carried out as part of the ongoing actuarial valuation of the Britvic Pension Plan at 31 March 2007.
They were reviewed by the actuary during the year and updated in light of the improvements experienced.
PEnSIOnS continued Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

The pension curtailment in the prior year was triggered by the transfer of group employees under the outsourcing arrangements of the secondary distribution network.
Those employees that are members of the BPP no longer accrued future entitlement, which gave rise to the curtailment gain.
