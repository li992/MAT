23 Employee benefits The Group contributes to a defined benefit pension plan the Plan, the assets of which are held by trustees separately from the assets of the Group.
The Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2002.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan was conducted at 1 April 2008 by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The Plan was valued using the following main assumptions: 2009 2008 % % Discount rate 6.75 6.50 Expected return on Plan assets 5.69 5.56 Expected rate of salary increases 4.50 4.50 Future pension increases 3.50 3.50 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term rate of return on Plan assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the 5.69% assumption.
