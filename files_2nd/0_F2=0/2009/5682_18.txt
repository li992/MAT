Notes to the Company Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives financial instruments which have been measured at fair value and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006.
The according policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently through current and prior year.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Revised Cash Flow Statements.
The company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are 100% owned by the group.
Further, the company, as a parent company of a group drawing up consolidated financial statements that meet the requirements of IFRS 7, is exempt from disclosures that comply with its UK GAAP equivalent, FRS 29 Financial Statements: Disclosures.
Going concern, debt covenants and liquidity The financial position of the company are set out in detail in this annual report.
The company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the groups $400 million dedicated multi-currency borrowing facility with Daily Mail and General Trust plc group of which the company is a part.
The facility is divided into four quantums of sterling and US dollar funds with three and five year terms with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $310 million 194 million and 59 million respectively.
The facilitys covenant requires the groups net debt to be no more than four times adjusted EBITDA on a rolling 12 month basis.
At September 30 2009, the groups net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.99 times and the uncommitted undrawn facility available to the group was 81.4 million.
The three year quantums of the facility are due for renewal in December 2011 and the five year quantums in December 2013.
The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over: a the level of demand for the groups products: b the exchange rate between sterling and US dollars and the impact on the translation of US dollar profits and losses from its US-dollar-based businesses and transactions, including the gains or losses from the groups forward contracts used to partially hedge these: and c the availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future.
The groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the group should be able to operate within the level and covenants of its current borrowing facility and continue to provide support to the company.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the companys accounts.
Turnover Turnover represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
y Advertising revenues are recognised in the income statement on the date of publication.
y Subscription revenues are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
y Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the income statement over the period the event is run.
Turnover invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line or other systematic basis as allowed by SSAP 21 Accounting for Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts.
Pension schemes Details of the companys pension schemes are set out in note 27 to the group accounts.
The company participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole to the individual entities, the company recognises an expense equal to its contributions payable in the period and does not recognise any unfunded liability of this pension scheme on its balance sheet.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land do not depreciate Freehold buildings 2% Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% - 33% Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 97 GROUP ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE COMPANY ACCOUNTS Notes to the Company Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Where the company has divisionalised the unincorporated businesses of its subsidiaries, the investment in the subsidiary then has the substance of goodwill and is reclassified accordingly.
Goodwill arising in these circumstances is not amortised in the company where the directors are of the view that the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The non-amortisation of goodwill represents a departure from the Companies Act 2006 but is necessary to give a true and fair view under the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure, as it would depend on the life adopted.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of FRS 19 Deferred Taxation, and is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange of the related foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
Recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognised in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognised as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Liabilities for put options over the remaining minority interests in subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheet at their estimated discounted present value.
These discounts are unwound and charged to the income statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
In respect of options over further interests in joint ventures and associates, only movements in their fair value are recognised.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the profit and loss account when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If it is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
98 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The company makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20 Share-based payments has been applied to all grants of options after November 7 2002, that were unvested at October 1 2004, the date of application of FRS 20.

The ultimate parent company, Daily Mail and General Trust plc, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of Daily Mail and General Trust plc have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2007, and adjusted to September 30 2009 by the actuary.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1,228.4 million 2008: 1,322.5 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 78% 2008: 99% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations and disclosures required under IAS 19 for the financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc are not materially different to the valuations and disclosures required under FRS 17.
The group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.

The ineffective portion recognised directly in the companys profit or loss that arose from cash flow hedges in the year was a loss of 6,700,000 2008: loss 11,961,000.
The company holds all the interest rate swaps for the group and full details regarding these can be found in note 18 to the group accounts.
There were no derivatives outstanding at the balance sheet date that were designated as fair value hedges.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The company has US dollar denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment of its subsidiaries which have US dollars as their functional currency.
The change in fair value of these hedges resulted in a decreased liability of 1,246,000 2008: 12,936,000 which has been deferred in reserves and will only be recognised in the companys profit and loss account if the related investment is sold.
There was no ineffectiveness in these hedges recognised in the profit and loss account 2008: 2,563,000.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate the book value.
