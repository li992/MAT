The net assets of the business at the date of disposal were as follows: m Goodwill 383 Other intangible assets 128 Property, plant and equipment 182 Stock 272 Trade and other receivables 745 Cash 104 Other 15 Total assets 1,829 Trade and other payables 717 Taxation 45 Loans and other borrowings 216 Provisions 68 Total liabilities 1,046 Net assets 783 Net assets disposed of 50% 391 The gain on disposal was as follows: m Cash consideration, net of costs 1,041 Net assets disposed of 391 Liabilities retained 14 Cumulative reserves recycled on disposal 12 Gain on disposal 648 Taxation 40 Net gain on disposal after taxation 608 Cash flows associated with the disposal were as follows: m Cash consideration, net of costs 1,041 Cash disposed of 104 937 Other costs arising indirectly from the transaction principally comprise 3m in relation to the accelerated vesting of a retail share option scheme that was of no value to option-holders, and 3m arising on the write-down of unamortised bank facility fees.
56 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2009 b Other costs arising from the transaction Further to the transaction with Best Buy, Best Buy Europe commenced the disposal of approximately 100 stores, primarily in the UK and France.
Costs of 19m have been recognised in the year in relation to the disposal programme, comprising fixed asset write downs of 7m and provision for disposal costs of 12m.
Also as a result of the transaction, Best Buy Europe accelerated a shift in its range of retail stock away from mobile phones towards laptops and other non-mobile products, resulting in an exceptional clearance exercise.
Losses of 8m have been incurred in disposing of the products that have been fide-ranged.
A tax credit of 4m has been recognised in respect of these charges.
c Divisionalisation costs Prior to the transaction with Best Buy, the Group conducted a comprehensive reorganisation of its central support structures, particularly in relation to its retail and distribution business, to achieve greater divisional autonomy and efficiency.
This reorganisation resulted in redundancy and other restructuring costs of 12m.
These costs are expected to attract tax relief at 28% and a tax credit of 3m has been recognised against them.
d AOL integration The Group acquired AOLs UK internet access business in December 2006.
Since this time the Group has been working on the reorganisation of the business through a programme to transfer network operations, hosting, billing and customer management away from a transitional platform provided by AOL Time Warner onto the Groups own systems and infrastructure.
The transition has been completed during the year at a cost of 16m, against which a tax credit of 4m has been recognised.
e TalkTalk Group reorganisation Further to the divisionalisation process detailed in note c above, TalkTalk Group has undertaken a comprehensive reorganisation of its structure and operations, which resulted in redundancy and other restructuring costs of 10m.
f Best Buy Europe reorganisation At the same time, Best Buy Europe has undertaken a similar comprehensive reorganisation of its structure and operations, which resulted in redundancy and other restructuring costs of 18m, against which a tax credit of 4m has been recognised.
g Foreign exchange losses An exceptional foreign exchange loss of 85m has arisen in the year following a change in the functional currency of the Groups brand company from Swiss Francs to Sterling.
The transaction with Best Buy necessitated a change in the operations of the brand company, which in turn made Sterling the appropriate functional currency.
As a result of the change, movements on the brand companys Swiss Franc borrowings, which would previously have been recognised through reserves, were thereafter reflected in the income statement.
These borrowings were converted into Sterling before 31 March 2009.
A tax credit of 24m has been recognised in respect of this loss.
h Impairment of non-current asset investments The Group has fully impaired its legacy wireless internet investments, resulting in a charge of 5m through exceptional operating expenses.
5 Discontinued operations Discontinued operations reflect the results of the Groups retail and distribution business prior to its part-disposal to Best Buy on 30 June 2008 see note 4.
Prior year results have been restated to present the results of the retail and distribution business on the same basis.
A reconciliation of reclassifications made from previously reported results is provided in note 33.
The results of the retail and distribution business for the full year, together with comparatives for the prior year as presented in the income statement, are provided in note 2.
6 Employee costs The average number of employees including Executive Directors for continuing operations was: 2009 2008 Number Number Administration 1,693 1,745 Sales and customer management 2,362 2,524 4,055 4,269 www.

Compensation earned by the Key Management of continuing operations, comprising the Group Board and operating directors, and the TalkTalk Group Executive Board, was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Salaries and fees 4.0 3.6 Performance bonuses 2.5 2.4 Benefits 0.1 0.1 Pension costs 0.1 0.2 Share-based payments 0.9 2.0 7.6 8.3 Compensation earned by the Key Management of discontinued operations, comprising the retail and distribution Executive Committee, was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Salaries and fees 0.3 0.8 Performance bonuses 0.1 0.7 Benefits 0.1 Pension costs 0.1 Share-based payments 0.2 0.8 0.6 2.5 Details of Directors remuneration are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 38.
Amounts of 0.9m were paid to HMRC during the year on behalf of a number of Key Management: these amounts were outstanding at 31 March 2009.

There were no loans outstanding from Group executives at 29 March 2008.
58 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2009 7 Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, through the following schemes: a Performance Share Plan: The Group has a Performance Share Plan PSP which uses share options to provide long-term incentives to senior management.
Awards made under the PSP in the years ended 31 March 2007 and 29 March 2008 are subject to Total Shareholder Return TSR performance targets and are measured over an initial performance period to 4 June 2010 and a subsequent performance period to 4 June 2011.
Details of performance targets are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 38.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Awards made in earlier years were subject to a mixture of Headline earnings per share see note 12 and TSR performance targets measured over a three or four year performance period.
The performance period for all such awards has been completed and where targets have been met the relevant share options have vested.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Following the transaction with Best Buy, employees of the Groups retail and distribution business were deemed to have left the Group, and any unvested PSP share options were therefore forfeited under the rules of the scheme.
At the discretion of the Companys Remuneration Committee, share options that were due to vest in July 2008 were not forfeited.
The following table summarises the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options for the scheme: 2009 2008 Number WAEP Number WAEP million million Outstanding at the beginning of the year 43 52 Granted during the year 2 Forfeited during the year 15 6 Exercised during the year 6 5 Outstanding at the end of the year 22 43 Exercisable at the end of the year 13 6 The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.3 years 2008: 8.3 years.

The summary above includes 5m 2008: 5m options that were granted before 7 November 2002.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, no cost has been recognised in respect of these options.
com 59 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 7 Share-based payments continued c Retail Share Option Scheme: Prior to the transaction with Best Buy, the Group operated a Retail Share Option Scheme, which provided market price share options to senior employees in the UK retail and distribution business.
Following the transaction, all unvested options were allowed by the Companys Remuneration Committee to vest early and the scheme was terminated.
The expiry dates of these options were changed to the later of three years from the last date of exercise, where an option-holder had previously exercised under the scheme, and 31 December 2008.
The following table summarises the number and WAEP of share options for the scheme: 2009 2008 Number WAEP Number WAEP million million Outstanding at the beginning of the year 6 2.90 4 1.82 Granted during the year 3 3.56 Forfeited during the year 4 3.03 2.14 Exercised during the year 1.72 1 1.53 Outstanding at the end of the year 2 2.73 6 2.90 Exercisable at the end of the year 2 2.73 2 1.61 The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.4 years 2008: 8.5 years.
During the year 0.1m options with a WAEP of 1.72 were exercised.
These options were exercised at a weighted average market price of 2.41 2008: 3.07.
Within options outstanding at 31 March 2009 were 2m options 2008: 6m held by employees of discontinued operations, of which 2m 2008: 2m were exercisable at the end of the year.
Of the 2m 2008: 6m options that were outstanding at 31 March 2009, there were none 2008: 1m with an option price between 1.00 and 2.00, 1m 2008: 1m between 2.01 and 3.00 and 1m 2008: 4m above 3.01. d Share gift: In December 2008, 3.6 million shares were gifted by the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trust to certain senior employees within the Group and Best Buy Europe.
The shares are restricted until 30 June 2010, and will be forfeited if various internal performance conditions, principally in relation to earnings and cash generation, are not met.
e Other employee share option schemes: The Group has a savings-related share option scheme which permits the grant to employees of options linked to a bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of between 5 and 250 per month.
Options may be exercised at the end of the three or five year period at a subscription price not less than 80% of the middle market quotation on the date of grant.
After the transaction with Best Buy all employees of the retail and distribution business were required to leave the scheme and all unvested options were allowed to vest immediately.
The expiry date on all vested options was changed to the later of three years from the last date of exercise, where an option-holder had previously exercised under the scheme, and 31 December 2008.
In addition, options were granted to UK employees at the time of the Groups admission to the London Stock Exchange.
Market priced options were also granted during the current year to certain senior employees within the Group and Best Buy Europe.
These awards are subject to internal performance conditions, principally in relation to earnings and cash generation, over a period to June 2010.
The following table summarises the number and WAEP of share options for the scheme: 2009 2008 Number WAEP Number WAEP million million Outstanding at the beginning of the year 8 2.00 9 1.60 Granted during the year 7 0.88 3 2.59 Forfeited during the year 4 2.38 2 2.26 Exercised during the year 2 1.24 2 1.07 Outstanding at the end of the year 9 1.08 8 2.00 Exercisable at the end of the year 1 0.92 1 0.88 60 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2009 The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.2 years 2008: 2.1 years.
The options exercised during the year were exercised at a weighted average market price of 1.87 2008: 3.33.
The summary above includes 0.6m 2008: 0.6m options that were granted before 7 November 2002.

Within options outstanding at 31 March 2009 were 4m options 2008: 4m held by employees of discontinued operations, of which none 2008: none were exercisable at the end of the year.
f Fair value models: Nil cost options with internal performance targets were valued using the market price of a share at the date of grant, discounted for expected future dividends to the date of exercise.
The fair values of other options with internal performance targets have been estimated at the date of grant using a Binomial model.
The inputs into the Binomial model were as follows: 2009 2008 Expected volatility % 35.0 29.2 Risk free rate % 3.1 5.8 Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 Expected volatility has been arrived at by using the historical volatility of the Groups share price, and the volatility of the share price of similar companies, whose shares have been listed for longer than those of the Group, over a period comparable with the expected lives of the options.
The assumptions made in relation to the timing of exercises are based on historical exercise patterns for each option scheme.
The fair values of options with external performance targets were estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model.
The model combines the market price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the historical performance of the Groups shares.
The historical performance period reflects a volatility of 27.4%.
A dividend yield of 2.0% was assumed in the model.
g Charge to income statement: During the year the Group recognised a charge of 6m 2008: 9m within continuing operations in respect of equity settled share-based payments.
The net charge in the year for share-based payments in relation to discontinued operations was nil 2008: nil.

The tax credit relating to statutory earnings for the year is 31m 2008: 22m.
The principal differences between the tax credit shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 28% 2008: 30% to loss before taxation are as follows: Restated 2009 2008 m m Loss before taxation 72 86 Loss before taxation at 28% 2008: 30% 20 26 Items attracting no tax relief or liability 5 Adjustments in respect of prior years 16 Impact of change in UK tax rate see below 4 Total tax credit 31 22 Tax on items recognised directly in reserves is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Current tax credit on share-based payments 9 Deferred tax debit on share-based payments 16 3 Deferred tax credit on available-for-sale investments 1 16 7 62 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2009 The deferred tax assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the year are as follows: Timing Share-based differences on Other timing payments capitalised costs Tax losses differences Total m m m m m Opening balance restated 23 8 65 96 Credit charge to the income statement 2 24 18 2 42 Charge to reserves 16 16 Disposal of subsidiaries 3 3 9 1 14 Closing balance 2 29 74 3 108 No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either year, except where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
From 1 April 2008, the UK statutory rate of corporation tax reduced from 30% to 28%.
The impact of this change on the value of deferred tax assets was recognised at 29 March 2008.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had unused tax losses of 307m 2008: 357m available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset of 74m 2008: 65m has been recognised in respect of 263m 2008: 216m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 44m 2008: 141m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 March 2009 the Group has unrecognised deferred tax liabilities of 20m 2008: 46m in respect of temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries of 78m 2008: 240m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Goodwill relating to Best Buy Europe is included in the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates see note 16.
The cash flows of TalkTalk Group are not separable into individual CGUs as its cash flows are derived from shared assets and infrastructure.
2009 2008 m m UK TalkTalk Group 304 299 UK retail and distribution 39 France 95 Germany 83 Spain 69 Other 92 Total 304 677 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on a country-specific growth rate for the UK, where all goodwill is now located, of 1.8%.
The average pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.7% 2008: 10.0%.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those in relation to the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period, all of which are based on historical patterns and expectations of future market developments.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Due to the substantial headroom provided by TalkTalk Groups cash flow forecasts, the Directors do not consider it likely that key assumptions may change to such an extent that it would lead to a significant impairment loss.

The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.
Customer revenue share agreements again arose on the acquisition of AOLs UK internet access business, and represent rights, subject to performance criteria, to a share of transactional revenues generated by AOL access customers and TalkTalk customers on AOL sites.
The valuation of these rights was again derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from the agreement, after a deduction for contributory assets.
Other acquisition intangibles primarily represent a licence to continue to use the AOL brand for a limited time period, valued using the relief from royalty method.

Bank overdrafts and other uncommitted bank loans: Overdraft facilities some multi-currency are held at a variety of UK banks to assist in short-term cash management.
These facilities bear interest based on a margin over base rate or LIBOR for the relevant currency.
550m revolving credit facility RCF : The Group has a committed RCF of 550m, which matures in March 2013.
The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period.
The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
A non-utilisation fee is payable in respect of amounts available but undrawn under this facility.
Covenants are included in this facility that limit the ratio of debt to EBITDA, interest cover and fixed charges interest and operating lease expenditure cover.
The Group was in compliance with these covenants at the year end.
375m term loan: The Group also has a term loan facility of 375m, which matures in October 2012.
The terms of this facility are similar to the Groups RCF, with an identical covenant package.
This facility was fully drawn in Sterling at 31 March 2009, and was fully drawn in Swiss Francs at 29 March 2008.
The average maturity of all non-current borrowings is 3.5 years 2008: 4.0 years and the weighted average interest cost was 3.8% 2008: 4.5%.
Borrowing facilities: The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2009, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, as follows: 2009 2008 m m Maturing in 2009 200 Maturing in 2013 500 315 500 515 The undrawn committed facilities at 31 March 2009 are the undrawn portion of the 550m RCF maturing in 2013.
Loans to joint ventures: The Group provides loan facilities to Best Buy Europe and Virgin Mobile France.
The terms of these loans are set out in note 16.

Although some guarantees are given by Group companies, these guarantees are to cover commercial obligations and, as such, create no additional credit risk.
Functional currency: At the end of the year, all of the Groups subsidiaries prepared accounts in either Sterling or Euro, further to the change in the functional currency of the Groups brand company detailed notes 4 and 22 and the disposal of the Groups South African subsidiary.
Prior to the disposal of Best Buy Europe, the Group also had subsidiaries that prepared accounts in Swiss Francs and Swedish Krona.
22 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments The book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments, excluding the Groups loans and other borrowings shown above, are as follows: 2009 2008 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 6 6 88 88 Trade and other receivables 140 140 813 813 Loans to joint ventures 293 293 Non-current asset investments 1 1 5 5 Available-for-sale investments 2 2 Forward currency contracts fair value hedges 3 3 Forward currency contracts cash flow hedges 1 1 Trade and other payables 267 267 1,088 1,088 The fair value of available-for-sale investments at 29 March 2008 was provided by third-party fund managers.
Other fair values have been arrived at by discounting future cash flows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts to year-end market rates or rates as appropriate to the instrument.
com 75 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Forward currency contracts net investment hedges: The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities and also for short-term liquidity management.
The Group currently holds no currency option contracts.
Forward currency contracts cash flow hedges: The Group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge transactional exposures.
These contracts are mainly denominated in Euros, South African Rand and US Dollars and primarily cover costs of sales and operating expenses.
At 31 March 2009, the total notional principal amount of outstanding currency contracts was 344m 2008: 333m.
Within this balance, 17m 2008: 31m is held in relation to cash flow hedges, for which the associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to the income statement when the transactions occur over the next 12 months.
The remainder of the outstanding currency contracts relates to investments in and loans to the Groups non-Sterling operations.
An expense of 3m was transferred to income in respect of forward currency contracts in the year ended 29 March 2008, which was offset by the foreign exchange movements of the financial instruments that they hedged.
All cash flow hedges will reverse within the next financial year.
Embedded derivatives: No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk such as currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group Treasury function, which operates under approved treasury policies, uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance from these risks.
These financial instruments primarily consist of bank loans and deposits, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, and foreign exchange swaps.
Other products, such as interest rate swaps and currency options, can also be used depending on the risks to be covered.
The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk: The Group is exposed to limited cross-border transactional commitments and, where significant, these are hedged at inception using forward currency contracts.
These exposures arise mainly through costs of sales and operating expenses.
The Groups foreign exchange position is calculated daily and any positions are closed out immediately unless the exposure is immaterial.
In some circumstances, the Group also hedges future currency commitments, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Group policy permits the use of long-term derivative treasury products such as cross-currency swaps for the management of currency risk although none are currently held.
The principal currency in which Group exposures arise is the Euro.
Translational currency risk for example, investments in overseas assets or the funding of subsidiaries is ordinarily hedged using foreign exchange swaps or currency borrowings.
The translation risk on converting overseas currency profit is not hedged and such profits are converted into Sterling at average exchange rates throughout the year.
Funding to Group subsidiaries is ordinarily denominated in the functional currency of each subsidiary.
As detailed in note 4, the functional currency of CPW Brands Limited changed during the year from Swiss Francs to Sterling.
As a result, foreign exchange movements arose in CPW Brands Limited on its Swiss Franc borrowings, prior to their redenomination to Sterling.
These movements are reflected in the profit and loss account of CPW Brands Limited.
Currency loans and deposits and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates: this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates assuming all other variables remain constant as follows: 2009 2008 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity movement movement movement movement m m m m 10% movement in the Sterling Euro exchange rate 3 43 Changes in the value of currency loans and foreign exchange contracts would not be expected to have an impact in the income statement, as they match currency assets, the value of which would rise or fall correspondingly, with net investment hedges assumed to remain fully effective.
The impact on equity of revaluations would be partially offset on consolidation by the revaluation of any net assets that are hedged by these borrowings and derivatives.
76 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2009 The effect of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at the year end was as follows: 2009 2008 Swiss Swiss Sterling Euro Franc Other Total Sterling Euro Franc Other Total By instrument m m m m m m m m m m Borrowings before derivatives 458 458 321 230 381 1 933 Derivatives 44 45 1 302 203 66 33 Total 414 45 1 458 19 433 447 34 933 Interest rate risk: The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest periods agreed at the time of rollover.
Group policy permits the use of long-term interest rate derivatives in managing the risks associated with movements in interest rates although the Group holds none of these products at present.
Since all cash, cash equivalents and borrowings are at floating rates of interest, no further disclosure on the effect of interest rate derivative products has been provided.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed in the chart below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of 1% movements in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated.
Funding to joint ventures and associates has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating these sensitivities.
This analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year-end positions prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.
2009 2008 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity movement movement movement movement m m m m 1% movement in the Sterling interest rate 2 1% movement in the Euro interest rate 4 Liquidity risk: The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the longand short-term cash flow projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it.
Regular reports are made to the Audit Committee assessing current facilities and debt and, in the shorter-term, weekly reports are circulated to senior management showing variances against the Groups cash flow budget.
Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing facilities do not expire for more than three years: it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings.
