26 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 1 Authorisation of fi financial statements The consolidated fi financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 26 February 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 April 2009.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The signifi cant activities of the Group are described in note 5, segment information.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated fi financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated fi financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
Prior year comparatives have been restated.
Please see note 3 for further information.
The signifi cant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated fi financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated within these fi financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The fi financial statements of material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 1, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated fi financial statements from or up to the date that control passes respectively.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Following the passing of the effective date for IFRIC 14 The limit on a defi ned benefi t asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction, the Group has applied this interpretation for the fi first time this year.
The application has had no impact on the Groups fi financial statements.
Signifi cant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifi able assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profi t or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
With the exception of overseas trading licences, which are deemed to have an infi nite life, intangible assets are amortised over periods of up to 10 years.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 2000 fi financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the fi nancing of major projects are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land is not depreciated Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years www.
co. uk annualreport0809 27 2 Accounting policies continued The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the value of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value less costs to sell of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be each trading outlet.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administration and distribution line items.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
co. uk annualreport0809 28 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 2 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outfl ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a fi finance cost.
Non GAAP performance measure Previously, Whitbread have separately highlighted exceptional items charged or credited in the income statement.
These exceptional items were presented on the face of the income statement in the middle of three columns for each periods presented results.
In the current year, the directors reconsidered this presentation and believe that there are additional items requiring separate presentation in the fi financial statements to assist readers full understanding of the underlying fi financial performance of the Group.
The directors feel that the change to a single column format for the income statement adopted in the current year, more clearly presents this underlying performance of the Group.
The face of the Income Statement now presents underlying profi t before tax and reconciles this to profi t before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated having adjusted profi t after tax for the same items, their tax effect and the effect of any exceptional tax items.
The term underlying profi t is not defi ned under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profi t measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profi t. The adjustments made to reported profi t in the income statement in order to present an underlying performance measure include: Exceptional items The Group includes in the non GAAP performance measure those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes the profi t or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and impairment in exceptional items.
Finance cost of cash ow hedges The fi finance impact of the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges and the movements in fair value of derivatives that are not part of a hedge relationship are excluded from underlying profi t. IAS 19 Income Statement fi finance charge credit for pensions Underlying profi t includes the service costs and impact of any curtailments but excludes the volatile fi finance cost revenue element of IAS 19 so that underlying profi t includes only the service costs and the impact of any curtailments.
IAS 17 non-cash rent impact of future minimum rental uplifts IAS 17 requires the total impact of future minimum rental uplifts to be recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, irrespective of the actual timing of the cost.
Underlying profi t excludes the impact of this straight-line recognition.
Taxation The tax impact of the above items is also excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day to day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge, in which case translation differences are taken directly to equity.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non sterling functional currency.
These are translated into sterling in the Group accounts.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
co. uk annualreport0809 29 2 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes.
The following is a description of the composition of revenues of the Group: Rendering of services Owned hotel revenue, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels, is recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverages are sold.
Revenue from franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names is recognised when earned.
Royalties Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food and beverages is recognised when they are sold.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which, under the allowed alternative treatment, are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
Except for awards subject to market related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
If options are subject to market related conditions awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met.
Instead these conditions are included in the calculation of the fair value of the awards.
co. uk annualreport0809 30 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 2 Accounting policies continued Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profi ts for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profi t nor taxable profi t or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi t will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suffi cient taxable profi t will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of fi financial assets and liabilities The recognition of fi financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of fi financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash fl ows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of fi financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets Financial assets at fair value through profi t or loss Some assets held by the Group are classifi ed as fi financial assets at fair value through profi t or loss.
On initial recognition these assets are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent measurement is also at fair value with changes recognised through fi finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative fi financial assets with fi xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profi t and loss or available-forsale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is signifi cant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identifi ed.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash fl ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defi ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
co. uk annualreport0809 31 2 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Cash flow hedges hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective hedges, is recognised directly in equity.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Note 17 describes the assumptions used in impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Note 36 describes the assumptions used in accounting for retirement benefit obligations together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
co. uk annualreport0809 32 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 2 Accounting policies continued Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB not effective for the current period and not adopted by the Group The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group: IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRS 8 was issued in November 2006 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard sets out requirements for disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments, its products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers.
The standard replaces IAS 14, with revised requirements for the identifi cation, measurement and disclosure of segment information.
The impact of this IFRS on the Groups fi financial statements is not expected to be material.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs A revised IAS 23 was issued in March 2007 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset.
A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
This IAS is not expected to have any impact on the Group as interest is already being capitalised under the previously allowed alternative treatment.
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC Interpretation 13 was issued in June 2007 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
This Interpretation requires customer loyalty award credits to be accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted.
Where these award credits are collected on behalf of a third party, they should not be disclosed as revenue.
The Group operates loyalty schemes using a third party but the impact of the change is not expected to be material.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payments The amendment was issued in January 2008 and becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendment clarifi es the defi nition of vesting conditions and the accounting treatment of cancellations by the counterparty to a share-based arrangement.
This amendment is expected to impact on the timing of the recognition of costs in relation to employee share schemes.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Revised versions of IFRS 3 and IAS 27 were issued in January 2008 and become mandatory for business combinations in annual fi financial statements beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The main impact on the Group will be in relation to the treatment of acquisition related costs, which will be expensed to the income statement.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements A revised version of IAS 1 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
It requires separate presentation of owner and non-owner changes in equity by introducing the statement of comprehensive income.
The statement of recognised income and expense will no longer be presented.
There will be no effect on the Groups reported income or net assets.
3 Restatement of deferred tax Following the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances for hotel buildings enacted in July 2008, IAS 12 Income Taxes has been re-interpreted and as a result the deferred tax provisions for hotel buildings have been re-appraised to use a methodology better representing the manner of recovery of the assets.
This gives rise to a restatement of the deferred tax liability as at 28 February 2008, reducing it by 79.3m: increasing retained earnings by 55.3m and reducing goodwill by 24.0m.
The effect of this restatement on the 2007 8 income statement has been to decrease the tax expense by 12.3m, resulting in an increase in the net profi t from continuing operations and profi t for the year by an equivalent amount.
The effect of the restatement on 2007 8 total earnings per share has been to increase basic earnings per share by 6.50 pence and diluted earnings per share by 6.46 pence.
A summary of the restatement as it affects line items of the income statement, balance sheet and earnings per share is as follows: Effect of As previously Restated restatement reported Year to 28 February 2008 m m m Income statement Profi t before tax 134.6 134.6 Tax expense income: Underlying tax expense income 59.1 6.1 65.2 Exceptional items 20.1 6.2 13.9 Net profi t from continuing activities 95.6 12.3 83.3 www.

The Group operates mainly within the UK and as such the secondary format of geographical segments is not presented.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The Group has two core areas of operation: Operation Nature of operation Hotels & Restaurants Operation of budget hotels and restaurants Costa Operation of coffee shops The segmental note for the comparative period has been changed to reflect the new segmental structure implemented after the disposal of David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Fridays.
Following these disposals it was announced that the Restaurants and Hotels divisions would merge, to better align the management teams to the business.
The segmental note for the comparative period has been changed to reflect the merging of Restaurants and Hotels into a new segment Hotels & Restaurants.
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the other segments.
Transactions were entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Included within unallocated operations are functions managed by a central division including the costs of running the public company.
co. uk annualreport0809 34 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 5 Segment information continued The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances held and controlled by the central treasury function, taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment and central working capital balances.

This was the combination of a premium paid to debenture holders arising on early redemption and the income from closing out the associated interest rate swaps.
The deferred tax charge arises as a result of the enactment by the UK government, in July 2008, of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances for hotel buildings.

From the dates of acquisitions, the hotels acquired during the fi financial year have contributed a loss of 0.1m to the net profi t of the Group due to the one-off costs incurred on these acquisitions.
If the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profi t for the Group would have been increased by 3.9m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by 13.9m.
These numbers include the impact of the 21 hotels acquired from Mitchells & Butlers plc, but excludes the impact of the pub restaurants disposed of in payment for the hotels.

The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.
Where the share price at the year end is lower than the option price the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The numbers of shares used for the earnings per share calculations are as follows: 2008 9 2007 8 million million Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 173.8 189.3 Effect of dilution share options 0.2 1.1 Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 174.0 190.4 The total number of shares in issue at the year end, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares, was 189.1m less 14.7m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.8m held by the ESOT 2008: 193.8m less 18.1m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.8m held by the ESOT.

This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
IT software has been assessed as having finite lives and will be amortised under the straight-line method over periods ranging from three to 10 years from the date it became fully operational.
During the year the useful economic life of elements of the Groups ERP system was reduced as a result of the reorganisation referred to in note 7.
The IT software amortisation charge for the year of 6.6m includes an accelerated amortisation charge of 4.3m as a result of this revision 2007 8: nil.
This has been included as an exceptional item.
Other intangibles Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and the brand name and franchise fee agreements acquired with the Premier Lodge business.

These developments are dependent on the outcome of future events such as the granting of planning permission, and consequently do not represent a binding capital commitment at the year end.
The Directors consider that developments likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of 41.7m over the next fi five years.
Capitalised interest Interest capitalised during the year amounted to 3.0m, using an average rate of 5.8% 2007 8: 1.5m, using an average rate of 6.1%.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% 2007 8: 9.0%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent and cautious view of medium term trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2007 8: 2.7%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment loss of 17.8m are set out below: Hotels & Restaurants The impairment at 21 sites in the strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors: High asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites which also anticipated higher growth rates at that time than are now expected Changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated Historical poor performance at a small number of standalone restaurant sites where there are limited further development opportunities.
Costa 14 Costa sites with an established trend of poor performance against the required capital investment have been impaired where their expected future cash flows have fallen to a level such that their value in use is below carrying value.
Unallocated A former distribution outlet which, as a result of the decision taken in the prior year to outsource the Groups logistics operations, is no longer in use and therefore has no value in use.
As a result of this the carrying value of the property has been reduced to its fair value less costs to sell.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the five year business plan and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Hotels & Restaurants Costa Unallocated Total m m m m Impact if business plan growth rates were reduced by 1% 1.2 1.2 Impact if discount rate was increased by 1% 3.8 3.8 www.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
This is calculated using the fi five year business plans approved by senior management.
The key assumptions in these calculations relate to revenue and the increase in rooms.
The calculation is most sensitive to revenue assumptions, however senior management believe that the assumptions used are reasonable.
Cash fl ows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2007 8: 2.7%.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash fl ow projections is 10.0% 2007 8: 9.0%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to the Hotels & Restaurants CGU.
A review of goodwill created during the year concluded that there is insuffi cient post acquisition trading history to suggest any impairment.
Goodwill acquired will be assessed for impairment as part of the Hotels & Restaurants goodwill impairment review in future years.

27 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal fi financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups fi financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below: www.
co. uk annualreport0809 51 27 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to fix between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which is beyond the life of the Groups existing revolving credit facilities.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, 410.0m 61.0% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 4.9 years 2008: 492.6m, 92.0%, for 5.0 years, using floating rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The average rate of interest on this fixed rate debt was 5.6% 2007 8: 5.7%.
In accordance with IFRS 7 the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 26 February 2009 and 28 February 2008 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 2.2m 2008: 0.3m and equity by approximately 19.6m 2008: 18.8m.
Liquidity risk The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 26 February 2009 and 28 February 2008 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: Less than 3-12 1-5 More than On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 26 February 2009 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1.9 8.3 8.3 702.3 720.8 Derivative financial instruments 5.9 5.9 30.9 16.4 59.1 Trade and other payables 134.5 7.9 142.4 Accrued financial liabilities 73.3 73.3 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 13.3 10.5 6.5 30.3 1.9 148.7 100.8 751.6 22.9 1,025.9 Less than 3-12 1-5 More than On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 28 February 2008 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 96.0 285.6 4.6 180.9 567.1 Derivative financial instruments 0.9 0.9 6.0 2.9 10.7 Trade and other payables 143.7 4.4 148.1 Accrued financial liabilities 63.8 63.8 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 11.0 12.0 5.5 28.5 96.0 430.2 80.3 203.3 8.4 818.2 Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 22. www.
co. uk annualreport0809 52 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 27 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued With respect to credit risk arising from the other fi financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into fi financial diffi culties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not signifi cant to the Group.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
Overseas investments are generally start-up businesses undertaken through joint venture arrangements.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and when they are required.
Capital management The Group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining an appropriate debt equity capital structure.
It uses a number of mechanisms to manage debt equity levels, as appropriate, in the light of economic and trading conditions, and the future capital investment requirements of the business.
Over the last two years these mechanisms have included a combination of special dividends and share buy back to return funds to shareholders.
The Group has stated its intention to manage its fi financial position consistent with maintaining its investment grade status.
28 Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups fi financial instruments.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash fl ows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Carrying values Fair values 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 44.5 107.1 44.5 107.1 Other fi financial assets 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings 1.8 96.0 1.8 96.0 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 665.8 436.9 665.8 436.9 Interest rate swaps non-current 27.6 7.6 27.6 7.6 Interest rate swaps current 11.8 1.8 11.8 1.8 29 Derivative fi financial instruments Hedges Cash ow hedges At 26 February 2009, the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 410.0m 2008: 490.0m whereby it receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fi xed rates of between 5.145% and 5.745% 2008: 5.145% and 7.375%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash fl ows from variable rate debt.
Cash fl ow hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in note 27.
The cash fl ow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 26 February 2009 and a net unrealised loss of 29.6m 2007 8: net unrealised loss of 4.5m was included in equity in respect of these contracts.

co. uk annualreport0809 57 34 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses.
The leases are non-cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Due within one year 74.6 56.2 Due after one year but not more than five years 248.3 196.4 Due after five years but not more than ten years 206.9 175.9 Due after ten years 791.2 542.1 1,321.0 970.6 The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 19.9 years 2008: 18.5 years.
Group companies have sub-let space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 26 February 2009 are 25.1m 2008: 34.3m.
Contingent liabilities There were no material contingent liabilities at 26 February 2009.
35 Share-based payment plans Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group.
Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS performance targets over a three year period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the Remuneration report on pages 10 to 18.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2009 2008 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 266,413 241,897 Granted during the year 163,236 150,322 Exercised during the year 53,348 66,008 Expired during the year 17,047 59,798 Outstanding at the end of the year 359,254 266,413 Exercisable at the end of the year Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason the proportion of awards which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.

No changes will be made to options already granted.
An earnings per share based performance condition will apply to any such options, and to the extent that the performance is not satisfi ed after three years, the option shall lapse as there is no opportunity to retest performance.
This was the case for the options granted in 2004, for which the performance target requires earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% over the three year performance period.
For options granted in 2005 the performance target requires earnings per share growth of RPI plus 4% per annum over the three consecutive fi financial years, these have now been met.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions required the Companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the 10 year performance period starting from June 2000 and ending June 2013 depending on when the options were granted.

Employment service Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
At 26 February 2009 there were outstanding options for employees to purchase up to 2.1m 2008: 2.4m ordinary shares of 76.80p each between 2009 and 2015 at prices between 5.39 and 14.17 per share 2008: between 2008 and 2015 at prices between 4.41 and 14.17 per share.
Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.
36 Retirement benefits Defined contribution schemes The Group operated a defined contribution pension scheme which closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
A replacement, contracted-in, defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect from 1 April 2002.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
co. uk annualreport0809 60 Directors Report and Accounts Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements At 26 February 2009 36 Retirement benefi ts continued The Group contributes a specifi ed percentage of earnings for members of the above defi ned contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defi ned contribution schemes in the year was 2.0m 2007 8: 2.0m.
At the year end, 782 employees 2008: 705 were active members of the scheme, which also had 6,747 deferred members 2008: 6,690.
Defi ned benefi t schemes The defi ned benefi t fi final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
The scheme is funded, and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
At the year end 885 employees 2008: 1,258 were active members of the scheme, which also had 27,584 deferred pensioners 2008: 27,961 and 15,645 pensions in payment 2008: 15,554.
The Group has reached agreement in principle with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited on the triennial valuation, which was based on the position as at 31 March 2008, and the associated recovery plan.
This valuation showed a defi cit on a funding basis of 388.0m.
The defi cit on this basis uses assumptions which are more conservative than under the requirements of IAS 19 and therefore produce a greater defi cit.
The recovery plan will provide for defi cit contributions until 2018.
The defi cit contribution payments, which will start from August 2011, will be 55.0m each year until 2013, then 65.0m in 2014 and 2015, 70.0m in 2016 and 80.0m in 2017 and 2018.
In addition the Group has agreed to grant security over 150.0m of its property assets in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited and to update and renew the fi financial covenant which has been in place since 2003.
All these arrangements are subject to appropriate consents, due diligence and fi final documentation.
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2009 10 are expected to be 3.0m.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defi ned benefi t section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane Clark & Peacock and Hewitt, using the projected unit credit method.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under this valuation method, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement, although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualifi ed actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as at 31 March 2008 of the UK schemes to 26 February 2009 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 26 February 28 February 2009 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% 5.0% Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0% 3.4% Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.1% 2.4% Discount rate 6.6% 6.2% Infl ation assumption 3.1% 3.4% The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.4 2008: 18.9 years if they are male and for a further 23.0 years 2008: 21.3 if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2029 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.4 2008: 20.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24.8 2008: 23.1 years after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each actual asset allocation for the Fund at 26 February 2009 rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum.
co. uk annualreport0809 61 36 Retirement benefits continued The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.6% 2008: 3.5% per annum above inflation.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is seven years 2008: seven.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2008 9 2007 8 m m Current service cost 4.5 5.5 Past service cost 10.0 Curtailments 0.5 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 4.5 5.0 Expected return on scheme assets 90.5 86.5 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 85.0 79.5 Other finance revenue note 9 5.5 7.0 The amounts taken to the statement of recognised income and expense are as follows: 2008 9 2007 8 m m Actual return on scheme assets 247.5 20.0 Less: expected return on scheme assets 90.5 86.5 Other actuarial gains and losses 82.5 162.0 255.5 95.5 The current and past service cost has been included in administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2008 9 2007 8 m m Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 1,340.0 1,405.0 Fair value of scheme assets 1,107.0 1,372.0 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 233.0 33.0 During the year, equity markets fell and performed significantly less well than expected, and bond markets generally fell and returned less than expected.
The financial assumptions underlying the calculation of the liabilities also changed during the year.
The combination of these factors led to an increase in the pension liability in the period from 33.0m to 233.0m.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2008 9 2007 8 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 1,405.0 1,562.0 Current service cost 4.5 5.5 Net interest cost 85.0 79.5 Actuarial gains on scheme liabilities 82.5 162.0 Contributions from scheme members 0.5 0.5 Benefits paid 72.5 70.0 Curtailments 0.5 Past service cost 10.0 Closing defined benefit obligation 1,340.0 1,405.0 www.
