Earnings per ordinary share The income statement may only disclose basic and diluted EPS.
The Group has also calculated an adjusted EPS measurement ratio as the directors consider it is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the businesss underlying cash earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as own shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same profit figure as that used in basic earnings per share and by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive ordinary shares arising from share schemes.
Adjusted earnings is based on earnings before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation.
