FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 52 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modi ed by fair values as applicable by IFRSs, and on the going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signi cant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed on page 55.
The following new Interpretation is mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2008 and has been adopted in the preparation of these accounts: - IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The adoption of this Interpretation has had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new Standards, amendments to Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not effective for the financial year ended 30 April 2009: - IFRS 8 Operating Segments: - IAS 1 Revised Presentation of financial statements: - IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing Costs: - IFRS 2 Share-based payment amendment: Vesting conditions and cancellations: - IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes: - IFRIC15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate: - IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation: - IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: and - IFRIC18 Transfers of Assets from Customers.
The Group has not adopted these new Standards, amendments to Standards and Interpretations early.
Their adoption is not expected to have a signi cant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain the bene ts from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identi able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identi able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiary undertakings are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
indb 52 28 7 09 28 7 09 09:47:02 09:47:02 53 Joint ventures Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out below.
The carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
Revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year and other income directly associated with property development.
Properties are treated as sold and pro ts are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
This policy applies to both residential housebuilding and commercial property activities.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Borrowing costs Interest is written off to the income statement as incurred.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable pro t nor the accounting pro t, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 under UK GAAP was not reinstated on transition to IFRS and is not included in determining any subsequent pro t or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, which include customer contracts, have a nite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at historic purchase cost less depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and ttings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% R&A R&A PRINT.
indb 53 28 7 09 28 7 09 09:47:02 09:47:02 FINANCIALS FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [CONTINUED] Computer equipment is included within xtures and ttings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identi ed, the recoverable amount of the asset is identi ed and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene ts associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within Net Operating Expenses in the income statement.
Inventories Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at fair value.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the fair value differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within Net Operating Expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances in hand and at the bank, including bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form part of the Groups cash management, for which offset arrangements across Group businesses have been applied where appropriate.
Share Capital Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares are classi ed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
Deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables.
indb 54 28 7 09 28 7 09 09:47:03 09:47:03 55 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES [CONTINUED] Employee bene ts a Pensions The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19 Employee bene ts.
The Group adopted early the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to equity through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Since the Group has elected to follow this approach, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee bene t schemes were recognised at the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period 1 May 2004.
For fide ned bene t schemes, the obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a quali ed actuary.
The operating and nancing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are set annually on the basis of actuarial valuations of the scheme and nancing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Pension contributions under fide ned contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
b Share-based payments The Company operates two equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Leasing agreements Payments under operating lease agreements are charged against pro t on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management applies the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgements, of which no individual judgement is deemed to have a signi cant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to forecast the costs to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b Pensions Pension assumptions are set out within Note 5 and are as advised by the Groups actuary.
The assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate used and the mortality rates.
Such estimations are based on assumed rates and, should these differ from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
c Goodwill impairment In determining whether or not goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, the future growth rate of revenue and costs, and a suitable discount rate.
d Deferred tax Assumptions are made as to the recoverability of deferred tax assets, especially as to whether there will be suf cient future pro ts to fully utilise these in future years.
For this reason segment reporting is only presented by business segment.
Included in Group residential housebuilding revenue and operating pro t are 46,088,000 and 3,644,000 2008: 13,106,000 and 806,000 in respect of land sales.
Unallocated income, costs, assets and liabilities relate to those areas that are managed centrally by the Group, and cannot be reasonably allocated to the business segments.
These comprise the Groups net cash debt and associated interest receivable and payable, the current tax creditor, the deferred tax asset and the tax charge.

4 PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION ANALYSIS BY NATURE Pro t before taxation is stated after charging crediting the following amounts: 2009 2008 Continuing operations 000 000 Staff costs note 5 74,640 94,290 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 964 1,016 Amortisation of intangible assets 554 1,817 Pro t on sale of property, plant and equipment 12 41 Operating lease costs motor vehicles 475 638 Operating lease costs land and buildings 2,036 1,840 Fees payable to the Companys auditors for the audit of the Parent Company and consolidated financial statements 120 120 Fees payable to the Companys auditors for other services: Audit fee for the accounts of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 110 110 Services relating to taxation 660 883 Remuneration consultancy services 192 Other services supplied pursuant to legislation 35 35 The value of inventories expensed and included in the cost of sales in 2009 was 476,241,067 2008: 657,611,895.
Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of taxation services was incurred primarily in connection with compliance matters and corporate activity in the year.
Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of other services supplied pursuant to legislation of 35,000 relates to the interim review 2008: 35,000.
In addition to the above services, the Groups auditor acted as auditor to The Berkeley Group plc Staff Bene t Plan and The Berkeley Group Money Purchase Pension Plan.
The appointment of auditors to the Groups pension schemes and the fees paid in respect of those audits are agreed by the trustees of each scheme, who act independently of the management of the Group.
The aggregate fees paid to the Groups auditors for audit services to the pension schemes during the year were 6,000 2008: 16,900.
Net operating expenses represent administration costs.

Key management compensation Key management comprises the Main Board, as the Directors are considered to have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
Details of Directors emoluments are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 34 to 42.
Share-based payments The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments in the year, relating to grants of shares and options awarded under The Berkeley Group Holdings 2004 b and 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plans, was 2,659,000 2008: 11,940,000.
The charge relates to key management personnel.
The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b and 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plans As announced with Berkeleys 2008 results, changes were made at the 2008 AGM to Berkeleys remuneration policy.
This constituted changes to the structure of the existing awards under The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan which split the original awards granted into two elements Element 1 and Element 2.
9 12 of the number of shares subject to the original awards under the 2004 b LTIP, totalling 15,991,021, were conditionally released with the Directors entitled to the final 3 12 of the number of shares, totalling 5,330,340, only if shareholders received 3 per share by 31 January 2014.
In February 2009, Berkeley announced the repositioning of its strategy, enabling the Group to take advantage of current market conditions by investing in land and returning to a more traditional dividend policy, rather than committing to return 3 per share by 2014.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan had been linked to the return of the 3 per share: therefore a review of the remuneration policy to re-align the targets to the repositioned strategy was required.
The balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan i. e. 3 12 of the shares, totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by options with an exercise price of 3 per share granted under the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The 2009 Remuneration Policy was approved at the Companys Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 April 2009 with further details set out, including the above amendments, in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 34 to 42.
Pensions During the year, two principal pension schemes were in place for employees.
The Berkeley Group plc Group Personal Pension Plan the Berkeley Group Personal Pension Plan and the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan the St George Group Personal Pension Plan are fide ned contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a fide ned bene t scheme which was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007. fide ned contribution plan Contributions amounting to 2,162,225 2008: 2,204,325 were paid into the fide ned contribution schemes during the year.
fide ned bene t plan The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2007 and nalised in July 2008.
The method adopted in the 2007 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment prior to and after retirement of 6.5% and 5.0% per annum respectively and pension increases of 3.25% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2007 was 9,974,000 and was suf cient to cover 101% of the schemes liabilities.
Following the nalisation of the 2007 valuation, with effect from 1 July 2008, employers required regular contributions were reduced to zero.
Notwithstanding this the Company made additional voluntary contributions of 500,000.

The life expectancy of male and female pensioners now aged 65 retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is 19.9 years and 22.9 years respectively 2008: 19.8 and 22.8.
The life expectancy of male and female deferred pensioners now aged 50 retiring at age 65 after the balance sheet date is 20.9 years and 23.9 years respectively 2008: 20.8 and 23.8.

For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares relate to the number of shares subject to released awards under employee share schemes and share options where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the shares during the financial year.
The effect of the dilutive Ordinary Potential Shares is 10,637,407 shares 2008: 71,072, giving a diluted weighted average number of shares of 131,389,302 2008: 120,740,207.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out in the table below: 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted average average number Per-share number Per-share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount 000 000 pence 000 000 pence Basic earnings per Ordinary Share 86,127 120,752 71.3 137,827 120,669 114.2 Effect of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares 10,637 71 Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share 86,127 131,389 65.6 137,827 120,740 114.1 8 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other Intangible Goodwill assets Total 000 000 000 COST At 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2009 17,159 3,273 20,432 ACCUMULATED AMORTISATION At 1 May 2008 2,563 2,563 Amortisation charge for the year 554 554 At 30 April 2009 3,117 3,117 NET BOOK VALUE At 30 April 2008 17,159 710 17,869 At 30 April 2009 17,159 156 17,315 COST At 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2008 17,159 3,273 20,432 ACCUMULATED AMORTISATION At 1 May 2007 746 746 Amortisation charge for the year 1,817 1,817 At 30 April 2008 2,563 2,563 NET BOOK VALUE At 30 April 2007 17,159 2,527 19,686 At 30 April 2008 17,159 710 17,869 The goodwill balance relates to the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited that was not already owned by the Group.
The acquisition was completed on 7 November 2006 and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of 17,159,000.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the current five year pre-tax divisional forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash ows beyond the initial five year period are not extrapolated ii A pre-tax discount rate of 9.46% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital The Directors have identi ed no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
The goodwill balance has been allocated to residential housebuilding within the segmental analysis.
Other intangible assets relate to contracts for the sale of units that had reserved or exchanged at the date of the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited that the Group did not already own.
This resulted in an intangible asset of 3,273,000 at the acquisition date.
This intangible asset is amortised as these reserved or exchanged units are taken to pro t and is included within Net Operating Expenses.

The revaluation reserve arose following the acquisition on 7 November 2006 of the 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited not already owned.
A revaluation reserve of 20,297,000 was originally created in accordance with IFRS 3 through fair value adjustments to the 50 per cent of the net assets of St James Group Limited owned by the Group prior to 7 November 2006.
Transfers of 7,163,000 in the year 2008: 6,396,000 to distributable reserves were recognised as the associated fair value adjustments were charged to the income statement.

The Groups objectives when managing capital are to maintain an appropriate capital structure in the business to allow management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, with exibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in the shortand medium-term.
During the period of the Scheme of Arrangement, initiated in 2004, the Groups strategy has centred on maintaining the Group at its natural size and returning surplus cash to shareholders.
In total, 1,087 million 9 per share was repaid to shareholders in a little over four years.
In response to the rapidly changing global economic environment the Group repositioned its strategy during 2009, away from a commitment to return 3 per share to shareholders, to investing its free cash ow in new land.
The Group monitors capital levels principally by monitoring net debt cash levels, cash generated and Return on Average Capital Employed.
As part of the repositioning of the strategy during 2009 Berkeley placed 6,041,030 shares which were fully subscribed for by shareholders raising net proceeds of 49.6 million.
This ensures Berkeley has the right capital structure with which to embark on this next phase and secure the future pro tability of the Group.
The Group generated net cash of 289.3 million during the year 2008: 156.1 million before the 241.6 million B share redemption resulting in closing net cash at 30 April 2009 of 284.8 million 30 April 2008: net debt of 4.5 million.
Return on Average Capital Employed which is calculated based on pro t before interest and tax, including joint venture pro t before tax, divided by the average shareholders funds adjusted for net cash debt was 20.6% for the year 2008: 29.3% and continues to demonstrate ef cient capital management.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash at bank and in hand, loan stock, trade receivables, trade payables, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
Cash at bank and in hand is the principal financial instrument used to finance the business.
The other financial instruments highlighted arise in the ordinary course of business.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments as described in the Market risk section below.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2008: nil.
It is the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Financial risk As all of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling there is no exposure to currency risk, and, with credit risk in the Group being low as set out in Financial assets below, the Groups main financial risks are primarily: - market risk, and principally interest rate risk, with the Groups cash balances currently held at oating rates linked to LIBOR: and - liquidity risk - this is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Further disclosures relating to market risk and liquidity risk are set out as applicable within the relevant sections below.

Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing.
Together, these balances represent the Groups exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date.
Trade receivables are spread across a wide number of customers, with no signi cant concentration of credit risk in one area.
There has been no impairment of trade receivables during the year 2008: nil, nor are there any provisions held against trade receivables 2008: nil, and no trade receivables are past their due date 2008: nil.

Unsecured loan stock is repayable on three months notice being given to the Company, with oating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Trade and other payables and other current liabilities are non-interest bearing.
The Group held no xed rate liabilities at 30 April 2009 2008: nil.
Disclosures relating to the security over the bank facilities are set out in Committed borrowing facilities below.
Maturity of non-current financial liabilities The maturity pro le of the Groups non-current financial liabilities is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES NON-CURRENT In more than one year but not more than two years 10,044 19,101 In more than two years but not more than five years 43,526 22,014 In more than five years 3,988 7,087 57,558 48,202 R&A R&A PRINT.

The carrying amount of current trade and other receivables and of current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms and have a short period to maturity less than one year.
The unsecured loan stock is repayable at book value on three months notice being given to the Company.
Other non-current liabilities principally comprise long-term land creditors which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The discount rate applied re ects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity pro le of the individual land creditors within the total.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Group management addresses this risk through review of rolling cash ow forecasts throughout the year to assess and monitor the current and forecast availability of funding, and to ensure suf cient headroom against facility limits and compliance with banking covenants.
The contractual undiscounted maturity pro le of the Groups financial liabilities, included at their balance sheet carrying value in the tables above, is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 In less than one year 570,478 510,613 In more than one year but not more than two years 10,318 20,240 In more than two years but not more than five years 45,351 24,653 In more than five years 4,312 10,565 630,459 566,071 Market risk As the Group is not exposed to currency risk, the principal market risk to which the Group is exposed is interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Group does not have any xed rate borrowings.
The Groups rolling cash ow forecasts incorporate appropriate interest assumptions, and management carefully assesses expected activity levels and associated funding requirements in the prevailing and forecast interest rate environment to ensure that this risk is managed.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments, when commercially appropriate, to manage interest rate risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
If interest rates on the Groups cash balances had been 50 basis points higher lower throughout the year ended 30 April 2009, pro t after tax for the year would have been 508,000 higher lower 2008: 78,000.
