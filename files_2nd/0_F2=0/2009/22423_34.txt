Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 10 and 11.
This shows that the majority of the Companys investments are in UK listed companies.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to the UK, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The sensitivity of a the return after taxation for the year and b the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each balance sheet date is given below.

Management of the risk The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts have not been used during the year to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.

The exposure to floating interest rates can be found on the balance sheet under cash at bank and under bank loans and overdrafts in note 14.

Interest rate risk sensitivity The Company is not materially exposed to changes in interest rates.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are in investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
For details of the Companys bank borrowing facility, see note 14.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings should be used to fund short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 30 June 2009, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, is given in the table above.
16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant and is managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the Portfolio Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
In summary, the exposure to credit and counterparty risk at 30 June 2009 was to cash at bank of 750,000 2008: 350,000 and to other receivables of 7,167,000 2008: 5,828,000 see note 13.
