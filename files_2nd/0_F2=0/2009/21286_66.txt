The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on the inside front cover and in the business review.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks: market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk, and the directors approach to the management of these risks, are set out below.
The Board of directors and the Manager coordinate the Groups risk management.
The Board determines the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to manage the risks and these are set out below under the relevant risk category.
The policies for the management of risk have not changed from the previous accounting period.
17.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises market price risk see note 17.1.
2 and interest rate risk see note 17.1.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of the quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from the Manager.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was as follows: 31 October 31 October 2009 2008 000 000 Equities 433,883 359,480 Fixed interest 19,079 16,036 452,962 375,516 50 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.1.
1 Market price risk continued Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the Groups net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2008: 20% in the fair values of the Groups equity investments at each balance sheet date.
This level of change is considered to be reasonable based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Groups assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Manager monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
The Manager measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Groups net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Groups exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 35% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown overleaf.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Groups foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US Dollar Sterling, Euro Sterling, Japanese Yen Sterling and Hong Kong Dollar Sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar Sterling - 10% 2008: 10%.
These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each balance sheet date.

2 Currency risk continued The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2009 2008 Hong Kong Hong Kong US$ Euro Yen $ US$ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 130747152 108 133 78 30 Capital return 9,977 2,511 4,649 2,744 9,018 3,114 4,703 1,072 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 10,107 2,585 4,720 2,796 9,126 3,247 4,781 1,102 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of an appreciation in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2009 2008 Hong Kong Hong Kong US$ Euro Yen $ US$ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 107 60 58 43 88 109 64 25 Capital return 8,163 2,055 3,804 2,246 7,379 2,548 3,848 877 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 8,270 2,115 3,862 2,289 7,467 2,657 3,912 902 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Groups objectives.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of the fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Group finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.1.
2 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
For floating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2009 2008 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash at bank 5,989 5,989 21,882 21,882 Current asset investment 13,500 13,500 Fixed interest investments 1,390 1,390 973 973 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Fixed interest investments 17,689 17,689 15,063 15,063 Debentures 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made, and borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2008: same.
Interest rate sensitivity The Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investment and its fixed income investment portfolio.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 5,989,000 2008: 21,882,000 and if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 60,000 2008: 219,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Company's current asset investment at the year end was 13,500,000 2008: nil and if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in interest rates up or down, would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 135,000 2008: nil.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 19,079,000 2008: 16,036,000, and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 5.2 years 2008: 5.9 years.
A 100 basis points change in short term interest rates up or down, which is mirrored by an equivalent change in long term interest rates, would be expected to decrease or increase this portfolios value by approximately 915,000 2008: 950,000, all other factors being equal.
17.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
54 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.2 Liquidity risk continued Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has a multi-currency loan facility of 5,000,000 with ING Bank NV 2008: 30,000,000 facility with ING Bank NV and an overdraft facility with the custodian, the extent of which is determined by the custodian on a regular basis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facilities are subject to regular review.
The Group also has two debentures, details of which can be found in note 16 on page 48.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that shortterm borrowings be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: 2009 2008 Due between Due more Due between Due more Due within three months than one Due within three months than one three months and one year year three months and one year year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 2,250 46,900 2,250 49,150 Other creditors and accruals 795 2,069 795 2,250 46,900 2,069 2,250 49,150 17.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
with regard to the corporate bonds in the portfolio, there is a credit risk that the borrowers do not repay principal or make interest payments.
This is managed through monitoring credit ratings and careful selection and is reviewed regularly.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Collateral details can be found in note 4.
None of the Groups financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 55 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.3 Credit and counterparty risk continued Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Group through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Group only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Groups rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Groups cash balances are held by our custodian, BNP Paribas Securities Services.
The directors believe the counterparty is of high credit quality, therefore the Group has minimal exposure to credit risk.
Credit risk exposure The table below summarises the credit risk exposure of the Group as at year end: 2009 2008 000 000 Cash 5,989 21,882 Receivables: Securities sold for future settlement 11,395 Prepayments and accrued income 1,868 2,307 7,857 35,584 17.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
The par value of the debenture stocks can be found in note 16.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade.
17.5 Capital management policies and procedures The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, and to generate total return to its equity shareholders in accordance with its objectives through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The portfolio includes unquoted investments which total 0.3% 2008: 0.2% of the total portfolio and which are held at directors fair valuations.
The Groups capital at 31 October 2009 comprises its equity share capital, reserves and debt that are shown in the balance sheet at a total of 473,863,000 2008: 410,661,000.
The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium :
