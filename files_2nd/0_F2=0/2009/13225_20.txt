In December 2009 the Group initiated a new restructuring plan to develop and accelerate the actions which had commenced in 2009 focused on the simplification and rationalisation of the sales and back office processes and to address the parts of the Regus network not generating a sufficient level of profitability.

The tax rate in the UK reduced from 30.0% to 28.0% on 1 April 2008 and the reconciliation for 2008 has been included at the effective UK rate for the year of 28.5%.
From 14 October 2008, when the parent company of the Group became Regus plc, the country of domicile became Luxembourg and the reconciliation has therefore been prepared using the rate applicable to that country.

Goodwill continued Cash generating units CGUs, comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these CGUs.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 153.2 168.6 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 5.4 5.0 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 10.2 10.6 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 90.3 90.3 259.1 274.5 The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two CGUs, the USA and UK, is material relative to the total carrying value comprising 90% of the total.
The remaining 10% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 23 countries 23 cash generating units.
The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash generating units is set out below: Goodwill Intangible assets 2009 2008 m m m m USA 140.9 140.9 156.1 UK 90.3 11.2 101.5 101.5 Other cash generating units 27.9 27.9 28.1 259.1 11.2 270.3 285.7 The indefinite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006 see note 13.
The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of future cash flows attributable to the unit The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk-adjusted discount rate for the Group.
While management believe that the projected cash flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term, in the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projected cashflows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of CGUs: Future cash flows are based on budgets for 2010 approved by the Board and identified for each CGU.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2011 that reflect an annual growth rate of 3 - 5.5% and a modest increase in gross margins driven by improving global economic conditions from 2011.
This compared to forecasts used in the evaluation in the year ended 31 December 2008 that projected 3% growth but reflected a higher level of baseline cash flows.
These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods.
As a result gross margins and real operating profits at the end of the five year period remain either at or below the levels achieved in the year ended 31 December 2008.
Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position reflecting the current uncertain global economic conditions.
Cash flows beyond 2014 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believe is a reasonable long term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate.
A terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long term nature of the businesses.
com The Group conducts a market risk assessment of CGUs in each country, with a country specific pre-tax discount rate being applied to the future pre-tax cash flows for each CGU based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital for the Group.
This, was unchanged from 2008 at 9%.
The underlying pre-tax rate therefore reflects current market assessments of the Group as a whole and is adjusted for risks specific to such businesses in each country, giving a risk adjusted range of 12% to 17% 2008: 13% to 20% for the underlying CGUs.
The high discount rate in the prior year reflected a significant market risk adjustment, which was in part a reflection of the Groups significantly depressed market capitalisation.
A detailed review has been performed of the value in use models and the appropriate rate at which its cash flows are discounted for impairment test purposes.
Whilst the market risk adjustments have been added to the underlying CGU discount rates, given the revised cash flows used and consistently stronger market sentiment during 2009, as compared to the end of 2008 with respect to Regus valuation, these adjustments are significantly below those used in 2008.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Current market conditions are more challenging for the Group and the current global conditions makes forecasting medium term cash flows more difficult than is traditionally the case.
The forecast cash flows used to derive the value in use are sensitive to changes in revenues driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination of both, costs and discount rates including the market assessment of the risks of the Group reflected in the Groups market capitalisation.
Actual conditions could result in either better or worse cash flows than included in the value in use calculation.
Should current economic conditions prove to be more severe or more prolonged than currently expected this would adversely impact the forecast cash flows and could result in impairments to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in future periods.
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the US CGU is sufficiently large to enable the directors to conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge for this CGU.
The key assumptions used in the US model are that in 2010 the forecast centre contribution falls from 21% to 18%, resulting in an operating profit of $10.5m 2009: $38.4m.
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2011 giving a terminal 2014 centre contribution of 23% and operating profit of $44.6m.
Thereafter a 2% long term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature so as to result in most cash generating units carrying amount exceeding its recoverable amount.
For the UK CGUs, however, a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used to determine the cash generating units recoverable amount could cause the units carrying amount to exceed its value in use.
For the UK, the goodwill and the indefinite life intangible brand in this CGU arose on acquisitions completed in 2006 principally the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business.
The value in use exceeded its carrying amount by 20 million 2008: 18 million and therefore no impairment was necessary at 31 December 2009.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the impact of the economic downturn in the short term on revenues and margins: the mid-cycle revenue achieved in 2014 prior to the application of the long run growth rate and the discount rate used.
Revenue is forecast to grow at approximately 5.3% p. a. from 2011.
A reduction in the growth rate of 0.6% would result in the carrying amount being equal to the value in use.
The model assumes no increase in gross margin in 2010, a modest increase in 2011 from 10% in 2009 to 12% in 2011 and an increase in operating profits from a loss of 2.9 million in 2009 to a breakeven result in 2011.
A further fall in gross margins in 2010 and 2011 by 1 point to 9% and 10% respectively equating to an operating loss of 5.3 million with recovery to a gross margin of 12% in 2012 would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
The model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2014 of 17% and an operating profit of 14.2 million.
A reduction to 16% and 12.8 million would result in the value in use being equal to the carrying amount.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2008:19%.
The discount rate used is based on a risk adjusted Group WACC, reflecting the specific risk profile of the UK business such as the greater degree of competition in the UK market.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 14% to 15% would result in its value in use being equal to its carrying amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Groups joint ventures.
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 59 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 13.
The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 12.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis.
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 65 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 23.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Going concern The Business Review on pages 12 to 15 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The financial review on pages 16 to 18 within the Business review reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group.
A feature of the Group has been its strong cash flows and during the year ended 31 December 2009, despite the difficult trading conditions, the Group has maintained its cash levels at comparable levels to the position at the start of the financial year.
Although many countries that the Group, operates in continue to experience difficult economic conditions, the directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions and expect to strengthen the current market leading position of the Group.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Following an internal review of the Groups facility arrangements in March 2009, and given the strength of the Groups cash position, the Board approved the early surrender of the 100 million revolving credit facility.
This decision does not impact the judgement of the directors that it is appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversified customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which contribute the majority of the Groups revenue minimises the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region is summarised below.
2009 2008 m m Americas 21.0 28.4 EMEA 38.7 51.3 UK 23.4 21.6 Asia Pacific 14.2 14.2 97.3 115.5 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
com During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group provided for an additional 14.1 million against potential bad debts 2008: 5.5 million and utilised 7.1 million directly against the balance of trade receivables 2008: 2.6 million.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.
Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has free cash and liquid investments excluding blocked cash of 180.8 million 2008: 205.4 million which the directors consider adequate to meet the Groups day to day requirements.
The Groups undrawn senior committed facility of 100 million was scheduled to expire on 19 March 2011, subject to the Group continuing to comply with the covenants of the facility agreement.
The covenants included the ratio of net debt to EBITDA: the ratio of cash flow to net debt service including net interest expense and scheduled debt repayments and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental charges.
In March 2009, the Board approved the early surrender of the 100 million revolving credit facility following an internal review of the Groups facility arrangements.
Of the facility approximately 50 million had been set aside to support bank guarantees provided against obligations of the Group.
In order to continue to support these, the Group deposited sufficient funds with the guaranteeing banks which reduced free cash available for use by an equivalent amount.
In so doing the directors considered the Groups forecast and sensitised cash flow projections and do not believe that this will have an adverse impact on the Groups liquidity given the strength of the Groups cash position.
Although the Group has net current liabilities, the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income that will be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
Although the Group holds customer deposits of 149.3 million these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current assets liabilities of the Group, excluding deferred income were 68.2 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 0.1 million.
It is considered appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it reflects the future non-refundable contractual revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in future periods.
Market risk Interest rate risk Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis.
In order to maximise interest returns, surplus cash is also invested in AAA-rated corporate bonds and deposits with a maturity in excess of three months.
At the balance sheet date no corporate bond or deposit had a maturity in excess of four months.
Whenever possible, and subject to the operational requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the head office and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
Working capital balances are generally held in the functional currency of the overseas subsidiary and therefore the impact of the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in the income statement of overseas subsidiaries is not considered to have a material impact on the Group.
The majority of the Groups net assets are in Pounds Sterling, US dollars and euros.
During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group adopted a policy of partially hedging the translation effect of certain profits incurred in foreign currencies including the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and certain East European currencies.
The policy aimed to reduce the impact on the reported profits of the Group from changes in the value of Pounds Sterling against the hedged currencies.
As at 31 December 2009, all foreign exchange derivative financial instruments had matured and no open positions were held 2008: nil.
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
In the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group used derivative financial instruments to manage the translation risk of certain foreign currencies on the reported profits of the Group.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Capital management The Groups parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Chief Financial Officer monitors the diversity of the Groups major shareholders and further details on the Groups communication with key investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 26 to 31.
In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.
The Groups Chief Executive Officer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and all executive members of the Board hold shares in the Company.
Details of the Directors shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 33 to 39.
In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share capital in the market.
In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares under the Groups share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders.
In the year ended 31 December 2009 Regus plc purchased 627,258 of its own shares in the open market and utilised these to satisfy employee share awards.
In 2008 Regus plc re-purchased 3,200,000 of its own shares in the open market and held these shares as treasury shares.
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Company declared an interim dividend of 0.8p per share 2008: 0.6p during the year ended 31 December 2009 and proposed a final dividend of 1.6p per share 2008: 1.2p per share a 33% increase on the 2008 dividend.
There were no other changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Groups objective when managing capital equity and borrowings is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group holds minimal debt and is in a strong cash position therefore it is majority equity funded.
The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups return on capital employed for the year ended 31 December 2009, defined as operating profit divided by total shareholders equity, was 17.2% 2008: 30.7%.

It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 3.4 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 1.1 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 9.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 12.2 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have increased the Groups total equity by approximately 0.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 0.3 million.
Fair value disclosures The fair values together with the carrying amounts show in the balance sheet are as follows: 2009 2008 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 205.1 205.1 219.5 219.5 Liquid investments corporate bonds 10.0 10.0 Other liquid investments 30.0 30.0 Trade and other receivables 168.2 168.2 198.4 198.4 Finance lease liabilities 2.1 1.8 3.0 2.6 Secured bank loans 0.7 0.7 1.0 1.0 Other loans 5.3 5.3 4.3 4.3 Customer deposits 149.3 149.3 174.8 174.8 Trade and other payables 138.1 138.1 174.8 174.8 117.8 118.1 60.0 60.4 Unrecognised gain 0.3 0.4 Summary of methods and assumptions: Trade and other receivables payables and customer deposits For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Derivative financial instruments The Group held several foreign currency swaps in the year, all of which matured during the year.
The aggregate gain in the movement of the fair value of these instruments was 2.2m.
The instruments were not designated as hedges and the gain has been recognised in the income statement.
No derivative financial instruments were held at the year end 2008: nil.
Committed borrowing facilities Principal Available m m At 31 December 2009 At 31 December 2008 100.1 50.3 Principal committed facilities in 2008 included 100.1 million of senior credit facilities, which the Group entered into in 2006, of which 50.3 million was available.
In order to continue to support these, the Group deposited sufficient funds with the guaranteeing banks which reduced the cash available for use by an equivalent amount.
The directors do not believe that this decision had an adverse impact on the Groups liquidity given the strength of the Groups cash position.
Share based payment Regus Group Share Option Plan During 2004 the Group established the Regus Group Share Option Plan which entitles executive directors and certain employees to share options in Regus plc previously Regus Group plc.
The table below presents the options outstanding and their exercise price together with an analysis of the movements in the number of options during the year.
Further details of the release dates and performance conditions set for 2010 can be found below.
The Regus Group also operates the Regus Group Share Option Plan France which is included within the numbers for the Regus Share Option Plan disclosed above.
The terms of the Regus Share Option Plan France are materially the same as the Regus Group Share Option Plan with the exception that they are only exercisable from the fourth anniversary of the date of grant assuming the performance conditions have been met.

com Regus Group Share Option Plan continued Performance conditions for share options The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest.
The share options vested based on the basic earnings per share adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible amortisation that exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index.
The basic earnings per share for performance purposes was 1p.
100% of the options awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007.
The options awarded in March 2007, April 2007 and March 2008 have the same performance conditions as the CIP Matching Awards granted in the same year as described further below.

A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards will be updated in the year ended 31 December 2010.
com Regus plc Co-Investment Plan CIP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued The performance conditions for the grant of awards under the LTIP are set out in the following table: 11p 12p 13p 14p For November 2005 and March 2006 awards: Adjusted EPS p for the year ended 31 Dec 2008 15% 20% 25% 30% For September 2006 awards: % increase in adjusted EPS for year ended 30 June 2009 compared to EPS of prior year Growth in free cash flow per share 10% 6% 13% 19% 25% 15% 13% 25% 38% 50% 20% 19% 38% 56% 75% 25% 25% 50% 75% 100% Adjusted EPS It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments are currently anticipated: In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
As such it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash flow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value.
In addition, the Total Shareholder Return TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.

In addition, no awards will be released unless the Companys TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of the grant subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The awards of Matching Shares made in March 2007 normal vesting date March 2010 failed to meet the related performance conditions based on the financial performance of the Group in the year ended 31 December 2009 and therefore lapsed.
The associated Investment Share awards will be released to participants subject to any tax liabilities in accordance with the rules of the CIP.
As indicated in the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2008, the Remuneration Committee felt it inappropriate to set specific performance conditions for Matching Shares under the CIP and options awards under the Share Option Plan awarded in March 2008 and March 2009 but were committed to carrying out a thorough review of the matter during 2009.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the following modifications will be made to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following performance conditions will apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010.
The total number of awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant will be divided into three separate equal amounts and will be subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively.
Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first amount will not vest until March 2013, the second will not vest until March 2014 and the third will not vest until March 2015.
These vesting dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively.
The vesting of these awards will be subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets.
75% of each of the three amounts will be subject to defined earnings per share EPS targets over the respective performance periods.
The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total shareholder return TSR targets over the respective periods.
The targets will be as follows: EPS targets for the financial years ending % of awards eligible for vesting 2012 2013 2014 25% 15p 17p 18p 50% 16p 20p 22p 75% 17p 23p 26p 100% 18p 26p 30p No shares will vest in each respective year unless the minimum EPS target for that year is achieved.
% of awards eligible for vesting Regus TSR % achieved relative to FTSE All Share Total Return index Nil 100% 25% Above 100% but below 101% Increments of 0.75% For each complete 1% above 100% 100% 200% or above over three, four or five year performance period.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that no awards of Investment Shares or Matching Shares will be made in March 2010.
However, the Committee can make stand-alone long term incentive awards under the CIP without reference to annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary per calendar year.
The Committee has determined that it is appropriate to make LTIP awards during 2010 of up to 100% of salary.
The performance conditions will be the same as those set out above over a three year performance period but with a single vesting date in March 2013.
The determination of the share awards will be made subsequent to the publication of this report.
However the maximum number of awards will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of grant and the monetary value will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Full details will be disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Report for the year ending 31 December 2011.

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 83 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 31.
Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations Onerous lease provisions For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the is considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to recover category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.
The business centre or where the books and records of the acquired accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, valuation, management calculate an estimated fair value based on discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtain third party condition are not known until the Group exit the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, valuations to provide additional guidance over the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely Valuation of intangibles and goodwill that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess Consequently provision has been made only for those potential potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to and can be reliably estimated.
recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the appropriate cash generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections, which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2008, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in note 12.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
