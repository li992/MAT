Prior period adjustment With effect from 1 January 2009 the Group has adopted the revision to IFRS 2: Share-based Payment vesting conditions and cancellations.
The revision clarifies vesting conditions and the circumstances giving rise to cancellations.
There are two categories of non-vesting conditions where the grant of equity instruments is considered cancelled: employees who elect to cease saving into the Groups Share Save Scheme or employees who are good leavers and have ceased saving for the Share Save Scheme.
In both cases, the Group immediately recognises the amount of the expense that would otherwise have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Previously these events were treated as forfeitures.
The amendments are applied retrospectively and hence a prior period adjustment has been made at the transition date, 31 December 2007, and for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The effect of the Income Statement and Statement of Financial Position is as follows: At 31 December 2007: m Statement of Financial Position impact Retained earnings share-based payment credit to equity 0.3 Retained earnings share-based payment charged to operating expenses 0.3 Year ended 31 December 2008: m Statement of Financial Position impact Retained earnings share-based payment credit to equity 0.1 Income Statement impact Operating expenses share-based payment expenses 0.1 As the adjustment is within retained earnings there is no impact on the Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2007 and accordingly a Statement of Financial Position has not been re-presented at that date.
There is no income tax effect on the above adjustments.
The impact of the prior period adjustment on the year ended 31 December 2008 loss per share is to increase the basic and diluted loss from 10.64p to 10.66p as disclosed in note 11.
Operating segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8: Operating Segments for the year ended 31 December 2009, which has replaced IAS 14: Segment Reporting.
The adoption of the new standard has not altered the make-up of the Groups reportable operating segments.
The Group operates two operating units and therefore presents two operating segments for segment reporting purposes: Investment Management and Property Asset Management.
F&C REIT, the property business acquired on 3 September 2008, has a separate Board of Directors with considerable autonomy, and operationally F&C REIT is managed separately from the rest of the F&C Group.
Prior to 3 September 2008, the Group operated as a single asset management business which did not comprise different operating segments.
While there are different sources of revenue within the investment management operating segment and distinct distribution channels, and assets under management can be categorised by client type and asset class, the Directors do not consider these to constitute separate operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8: Operating Segments as the internal financial reporting and performance monitoring is not further segregated below the level of the aforementioned operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its two operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Transfer prices between the operating segments reflect the arms-length agreements entered into at the time of acquiring REIT and creating the property asset management operating segment.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transactions between operating segments, which are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those of the Group.

Expenses continued The Groups policy on the award of non-audit services to accountancy firms is outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance.
During the year the fees paid by F&C to other accountancy firms for non-audit services were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Ernst & Young 0.4 0.6  0.4 0.5 Deloitte 0.3 0.2 BDO 0.2 Jebensmensching 0.1 1.4 1.3 During 2009, in addition to the above, 0.1m 2008: 0.8m was paid to Deloitte for services relating to acquisitions.
These fees have been capitalised and are included within expenses of acquisition see note 16.
In addition to the above, the following fees were paid by OEICs, unit trusts and SICAVs, for which Group companies are the Authorised Corporate Director or Manager, for services provided directly to them: 2009 2008 m m  0.5 0.4 6.
Employee benefit expenses Total employee benefit expenses, including remuneration of the Directors, were: 2009 2008 as restated Notes m m Short-term employee benefits: Salaries and related benefits 56.6 58.6 Bonus 15.9 18.6 Wages and salaries 72.5 77.2 Social Security costs 11.2 7.9 83.7 85.1 Post-employment benefits: Defined contributions scheme expenses 27 h 4.2 4.5 Defined benefits scheme expenses 27 d 2.6 3.5 6.8 8.0 Total of wages and salaries, Social Security costs and post-employment benefits 90.5 93.1 Other long-term employee benefits 0.1 Termination benefits 4.6 4.6 Share-based payment expenses 28 20.3 14.4 Total employee benefits expenses 115.5 112.1 As restated for the amendment to IFRS 2: Share-based Payment as disclosed in note 1.
The monthly average number of employees including Executive Directors of the Group during 2009 was 923 2008: 1,052.
F&C Asset Management plc had no employees during either year.
The above table includes 6.1m 2008: 4.8m of exceptional employment costs, as disclosed in note 7 b.
Exceptional income and expenditure a Unrealised gains losses on forward currency contracts 2009 2008 m m Unrealised gains losses on forward currency contracts 1.2 12.3 During 2008, the Group entered into a series of forward currency contracts to provide certainty to the Sterling value of a portion of the Groups Euro denominated cash flows.
In line with accounting requirements, open contracts are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at their fair value.
During the 12 months ended 31 December 2009 an unrealised gain of 1.2m was recognised.
Unrealised gains losses are excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings.
Realised gains or losses on such contracts are included in determining underlying earnings.
b Other exceptional operating expenses income The Group has classified the following operating expenses income as exceptional: 2009 2008 m m Corporate advisory fees i 2.6 4.4 Exceptional employment and staff related costs ii 6.1 4.8 F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP expense iii 3.7 1.4 Investment Trust VAT income iv 2.5 Exceptional client compensation expense v 2.5 Exceptional property expense vi 2.5 Put option claim expense vii 4.1 19.0 10.6 F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 68 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 7.
Exceptional costs continued i Corporate advisory fees During 2008, Friends Provident announced its intention to divest of its 52 per cent.
shareholding in F&C, which was effected on 3 July 2009.
During 2008, legal, commercial and corporate finance advisors fees were incurred in seeking to identify acquisition opportunities which would create value for F&Cs shareholders.
During 2009, a further 2.6m of corporate advisory fees and costs relating to the separation of F&C from Friends Provident were incurred.
The Directors consider these advisory costs to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded this expense from the measurement of underlying earnings.
ii Exceptional employment and staff related costs As a result of the challenging and volatile market conditions experienced in 2008 and the adverse consequential impact on the Groups revenues, management identified and initiated actions in 2008 and 2009 to achieve annualised cost savings.
Management sought to avoid any cost saving initiative which would significantly impede the Groups distribution capabilities which are key for business growth.
The Directors consider significant redundancy and related costs to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded the associated employment costs of 6.1m incurred during 2009 from the measurement of underlying earnings.
iii F&C REIT variable minority interest share-based payment SBP expense F&C controls 70 per cent.
of F&C REIT, the Groups property business, and the former owners of REIT, two of whom occupy key management roles within F&C REIT, hold a 30 per cent.
The former owners have the opportunity to increase their ownership by a further 10 per cent.
through the achievement of certain performance targets over the next five years.
This earn-out mechanism meets the criteria of a share-based payment and results in a charge of 3.7m to the Income Statement in 2009.
This expense has been excluded from underlying earnings as it is considered to be capital in nature, which is consistent with the treatment of share scheme costs associated with previous acquisitions.
Full details of this arrangement are given in note 28 c. iv Investment Trust VAT income During 2007, following the outcome of litigation, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC concluded that investment management fees paid by investment trusts were not subject to VAT.
In 2007 a provision was recognised for the VAT and associated interest costs which the Directors considered may be payable to investment trust clients in respect of historic periods, beyond the amounts recoverable from HMRC.
The Group has now settled all amounts payable in respect of this matter, and the credit of 2.5m recognised in the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2009 represents the excess provision, net of professional costs incurred in respect of the matter during 2009.
The Directors have excluded this income from underlying earnings to be consistent with the treatment of the expense when the provision was initially recognised.
Details and movements in the associated provision are given in note 26. v Exceptional client compensation expense The exceptional client compensation expense of 2.5m represents the net expected cost to the Group of amounts reimbursable to a client as a result of a breach of their investment mandate.
This expense relates to a single event in respect of one client, attributable to a unique set of circumstances.
Given the scale of the compensation, the Directors consider it appropriate to exclude this cost from the measurement of underlying earnings.
vi Exceptional property expense The Group has a number of onerous sub-let properties, which have arisen from historic acquisitions, as the Group has reduced its space requirements for its own operations.
During 2009, the tenant in one of the Groups sub-let premises sought to exercise a break clause in their lease and vacate the premises.
As it was economically beneficial to retain that tenant rather than seek to re-market the vacant premises, additional lease incentives of some 2.5m were granted to the existing tenant.
Given both the quantum of the increase in this provision and the fact that this lease was acquired with a historical corporate acquisition, the Directors consider it appropriate to exclude the associated exceptional expense from the measurement of underlying earnings.
vii Put option claim expense Note 26 outlines the circumstances surrounding the put option notice received from the founder members of F&C Partners LLP Partners, the Groups majority owned fund of hedge funds business.
The Company vigorously denies the validity of that put option notice under the Partnership Agreement, but has incurred legal and associated costs of 4.1m, including provisioning, in respect of this matter.
Given the quantum and nature of this claim, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat this cost as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings.

Exceptional costs continued c F&C REIT put option fair value gain 2009 2008 m m F&C REIT put option fair value gain 5.6 The fair value of the F&C REIT put option liability, as disclosed in note 30, reflects the value of the F&C REIT business which is currently owned by the minority interest partners and which is the subject of options, as detailed in note 16.
The reduction in the fair value of the options during the year of 5.6m has been recognised as a fair value gain in the Income Statement.
The Directors consider the value of the options and movements therein to be of a capital nature, and have therefore excluded this fair value gain from the measurement of underlying earnings.
d Gain on debt exchange 2009 2008 m m Gain on debt exchange 27.9 During 2009 the Group executed a debt exchange programme, as outlined in note 24, which sought to capitalise on the prevailing market conditions.
A net gain of 27.9m arose on the partial extinguishment of existing subordinated debt, after accounting for the fees and other costs associated with the extinguishment of this debt.
The Directors consider the quantum and nature of this gain to be exceptional and consider it appropriate to exclude this gain from the measurement of underlying earnings.

Earnings per Share Basic earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares.
In the opinion of the Directors the underlying earnings as quantified as in the Reconciliation of earnings loss table below, more accurately reflects the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

Where the Group has incurred a basic loss per Ordinary Share, no dilution arises despite the dilutive potential weighted average number of Ordinary Shares being greater than the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares used to determine the basic loss per share.
As a result, the reported basic and diluted loss per Ordinary Share are the same in 2008.
All amounts disclosed in the table above are stated net of any attributable tax, as presented in the Reconciliation of earnings loss table below.

Where the option prices are below the average share price for the year, these options have been treated as dilutive.
The F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP, details of which are disclosed in note 28 c, gives the F&C REIT minority partners the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT from 30% to 40% before 31 December 2014.
This would potentially dilute the profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The potential effect of the dilution on the profits for the year are as follows: 2009 2008 as restated m m Profits losses attributable to equity holders of the parent 15.9 52.5 Dilution of profits through increase in F&C REIT minority interest ownership 0.8 0.3 Profits losses attributable to equity holders of the parent after dilution 15.1 52.8 As restated for the amendment to IFRS 2: Share-based Payment as disclosed in note 1.
However, the principle of the incentive is that the incremental profits which would become attributable to minority interests as a result of achieving the performance criteria are funded from the increased level of absolute profits generated by F&C REIT for the year in which vesting arises, rather than diluting the current level of profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There can be no guarantee that, subsequent to vesting, the higher level of profits which met the vesting criteria would necessarily be sustainable.
In the period between the reporting date and the approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements, no share awards 2008: 417,586 vested which were satisfied by the issue of Ordinary Share capital.
Potential future dilution The Group operates several share-based payment schemes which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future but which were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive for the years presented.
The share-based payment schemes with relevant performance criteria must meet such criteria for each scheme before the exercise of options is possible.
The only exception to this is for good leavers, where there is usually a period of time over which the employees can exercise their options in accordance with the specific rules of each scheme regardless of whether the performance criteria have been met.
The remaining options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme vested during 2006, as the performance criteria had been met.
At 31 December 2009 the 532,122 31 December 2008: 884,182 options outstanding, at exercise prices between 214.00p and 455.83p, are now potentially dilutive, as settlement would be made by the issue of new shares.
The remaining options granted under the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme vested during 2006, as the performance criteria had been met.
At 31 December 2009 the 1,082,028 31 December 2008: 1,082,028 options outstanding, at exercise prices between 139.00p and 240.83p, are now potentially dilutive, as settlement would be made by the issue of new shares.
Details of other awards exercisable at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 are disclosed in note 28, together with the total number of awards outstanding for each scheme.

Following the acquisition of the REIT Group in September 2008, the business was re-organised into two distinct operating segments: Investment Management IM and Property Asset Management PAM.
These are separate business operations and are regarded as reportable segments under IFRS 8: Operating Segments.
These operating segments represent the cash generating units CGUs and the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Board and tested for impairment.
The goodwill existing prior to the REIT acquisition was split between these two operating segments on the basis of the values in use of the respective business operations and resulted in 102.7m being allocated to PAM, leaving 467.2m attributable to IM.
The additional goodwill arising in 2008 relates to the acquisition of the REIT Group, while the goodwill disposed of relates to the 30 per cent.
transfer of F&Cs existing property business to the former owners of REIT: both amounts relate to the transactions arising on creation of the PAM operating segment.
Details of the acquisition and disposal are given in note 16.
At the end of 2008 and 2009, of the total goodwill of 595.1m, 127.9m relates to PAM, and 467.2m relates to IM, there having been no movement in goodwill in either segment during 2009.
Goodwill is not amortised but requires to be tested for impairment annually or when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
The carrying value of goodwill attributable to each operating segment has been tested for impairment at the reporting date, as described below.
Accumulated goodwill impairment losses at 31 December 2009 were nil for both operating segments 31 December 2008: nil.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Management contracts Management contracts predominantly relate to contracts arising from business acquisitions.
The addition during 2008 of 71.3m is the value attributed to the management contracts acquired through the REIT business combination.
Management contracts are amortised over their expected useful lives and are tested for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
No such indicators have been identified since the last impairment review undertaken as at 31 December 2008 and therefore no impairment review of management contracts has been undertaken this year.
The management contract impairment losses recognised in prior years relate entirely to the IM operating segment: the accumulated impairment losses at 31 December 2009 were 218.3m, 31 December 2008: 218.3m.
Details of impairment recognised in 2008 are disclosed below.
The foreign exchange losses in the year arise from the relative weakening of the Euro over the course of 2009, reducing the value of contracts denominated in that currency primarily F&C insurance contracts, in Sterling terms.
The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year-end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 Net Remaining Net Remaining book amortisation Estimated book amortisation Estimated values period useful life values period useful life m years years m years years RSAI insurance contracts 1.7 2 10 2.4 3 10 RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 13.5 2 5 10 17.9 3 6 10 F&C insurance contracts 76.2 5 10 100.2 6 10 F&C institutional contracts fixed term non-fixed term 17.7 5 1 10 4 29.4 6 2 10 4 1 F&C investment trust contracts 14.0 6 2 10 16.1 71 2 10 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 25.0 5 10 32.0 6 10 Private equity fund of funds 0.9 15 20 1.0 16 20 REIT property contracts 57.7 6 7 67.9 7 7 206.7 266.9 Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined on their value in use including terminal value at each respective testing date for 2008 and 2009.
The value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board, and managements forecasts.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows because of the long-term nature of the Groups business making up the CGUs and the Boards current view that there is no reason to believe that they will not continue in operation in perpetuity.
The key assumptions adopted in these calculations for each business segment are as follows: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 IM PAM IM PAM Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Discount rate 10.25% 10.25% 10.15% 10.15% 10.15% 10.15% 10.15% 10.15% Market growth rate 5.35% 4.15% 0.00% 6.00% 5.55% 4.15% 0.00% 4.15% Inflation rate 4.25% 4.25% 3.75% 3.75% 3.75% 3.75% In 2008, separate market growth rates were assumed over the first three years of the projections due to the market conditions and the outlook at that time, and the assumptions adopted for the 2009 budget.
In 2009, the valuation models have reverted to applying constant long-term growth rates across years.
The costs included in year 1 of the projections reflect those included in the Board approved budget for the respective year.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital to estimate a market relevant rate, calculated as at the year-end, and takes into account the relative risks associated with the Groups various revenue streams included in operating segments.
The discount rate disclosed above is the post-tax rate which has been applied in the projections: the pre-tax discount rate is 11.40% 2008: 10.93%.
All discount rates shown subsequently within this note are stated after tax.
Revenues are based on the Board-approved budget for each operating segment, and managements forecasts for the subsequent four years.
Thereafter, revenues have been grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates reflect the composite mix of assets held in each operating segment for each period.
Net new business revenues are included at the levels assumed in the 2010 budget and managements forecasts up to 2014 with no further net new business included thereafter.
Additional costs associated with the increased revenues have been included in the projections, primarily to reflect variable remuneration costs.
Revenues earned from significant contracts with a fixed term are assumed to terminate at the end of the fixed term, with operating costs falling by an amount which assumes associated profit margins of 70%.
Projected operating costs for the first year are driven by the budgeted profit margins for each operating segment for 2010.
Thereafter, both existing budgeted costs and, as noted above, further costs added associated with net new business revenue forecasts have been grown at inflation rates to accord with anticipated future salary and other cost increases.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill continued Values in use are compared to the carrying values of goodwill, attributable management contracts and other intangible assets net of associated deferred tax provisions, and property, plant and equipment in order to ascertain whether any impairment exists.
As this annual impairment review of goodwill determined surpluses in both segments, no impairment has been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill 31 December 2008: nil.
The key assumptions to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive are as follows: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 IM PAM IM PAM Discount rate 10.25% 10.25% 10.15% 10.15% Long-term market growth rate 5.35% 4.15% 5.55% 4.15% Inflation rate 4.25% 4.25% 3.75% 3.75% The above assumptions, together with the inclusion of forecast net new business revenues and associated costs in the 2009 cash flow projections, result in the following surpluses of goodwill: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 IM PAM IM PAM m m m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 615.1 74.6 74.4 55.0 In order to assess the sensitivity of the key assumptions on the carrying values of goodwill, an analysis was conducted to ascertain the change that would be required to derive values in use which approximated to the carrying values of goodwill, and beyond which impairment would arise.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were as follows: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 IM PAM IM PAM Discount rate 17.00% 13.35% 11.00% 12.40% Long-term market growth rate 2.55% 1.28% 5.15% 1.65% Inflation rate 7.65% 9.20% 4.25% 7.20% Per cent achievement of new business targets 0.00% 41.85% Intangible assets with finite lives During 2008, the significant fall in equity markets and consequent reduction in management fee revenues arising from management contracts was considered to be an indicator of potential impairment of certain management contract intangible assets.
Previously, indicators of impairment had only arisen where fund outflows were significantly greater than the levels which had been forecast when the assets were recognised or when subsequent impairment reviews were performed.
No indicators of potential impairment of management contracts have been identified since the 2008 review, and therefore no impairment reviews of management contracts have been undertaken for 2009.
The information which follows in the remainder of this note is the disclosure in respect of the comparative period.
In accordance with IAS 36: Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review of assets where impairment indicators were identified was undertaken as at 31 December 2008.
The review resulted in impairment losses being recognised in respect of the assets below, across reportable operating segments as follows: 2009 2008 IM PAM Total IM PAM Total m m m m m m RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 11.3 11.3 F&C institutional contracts 10.5 10.5 F&C investment trust contracts 7.9 7.9 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 18.6 18.6 Total impairment recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 48.3 48.3 The recoverable amounts of the assets were determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections, for each contract category, based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board.
The key assumptions adopted in the 2008 calculations were as follows: Discount rate Market growth rates Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 10.65% 0.00% 7.50% 6.35% F&C institutional contracts fixed term 9.65% 0.00% 5.90% 5.60% F&C institutional contracts non-fixed term 10.65% 0.00% 5.90% 5.60% F&C investment trust contracts 10.65% 0.00% 8.95% 6.85% F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 10.65% 0.00% 6.35% 5.80% F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 77 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 14.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Intangible assets with finite lives continued The discount rates reflect the varying risks and uncertainties inherent in the revenues from the underlying assets, using the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 10.15%, calculated as at 31 December 2008, as a benchmark.
Consistent with the Board-approved budget for 2009, revenues for the first year of the projections assumed no market growth.
In year two, revenues were grown at market rates estimated to be experienced in 2010 when the Board anticipated capital markets would begin to recover: these estimates were based on a combination of in-house and analysts views in light of the prevailing market conditions at the time.
Beyond that, revenues were grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates across the contract types reflect the composite mix of asset classes held in each category: the actual growth rates applied to each asset class were identical to those used in the 2008 goodwill impairment reviews.
The projections were derived using the estimated average lives of the underlying contracts and assumed a constant loss of revenues over the projection periods, except in the case of fixed term contracts.
Projected operating costs were driven by the reportable operating segment projected operating profit margins, as determined for the purposes of the 2008 goodwill impairment review, including the cost inflation assumptions inherent therein, noted above.
Impairment was determined by comparing the results of the value in use calculations to the carrying values cost less aggregate amortisation and prior years impairment of the assets at 31 December 2008, with the deficits arising constituting impairment to be recognised for the year.

The fair value of the unquoted investments has been estimated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique applied to unquoted shares which are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position, and the related realised fair value gains recorded in the Income Statement, are reasonable and the most appropriate at the reporting date.
The investments have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Included within the unquoted financial investments at 31 December 2009 are 0.1m 31 December 2008: 0.2m of equity instruments measured at the price of recent investments.
The fair value of these investments cannot be measured reliably as the Group does not have access to the underlying information to produce fair value valuations for these investments.
These investments consist of loans and carried interest in private equity limited partnerships.
These investments are managed by external fund managers and the Group obtains income when the investments are realised.
The Group intends to hold these investments until all the private equity investments are realised.
In 2009, the Group received distributions totalling nil 2008: 0.9m which comprised nil 2008: 0.9m of investment income and nil 2008: nil return of capital in respect of the investments held at cost.
Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries a 2008 Acquisition of REIT Property Asset Management Group F&C Asset Management plc FCAM acquired and gained control of the REIT Property Asset Management Group REIT Group on 3 September 2008.
As part of this transaction, FCAM relinquished 30% of its beneficial entitlement in F&C Property Asset Management plc F&C PAM by transferring its interest into the newly created F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT Group property business, which is 30% minority owned.
F&C REIT ownership interests are initially split as follows 70% of A and B partnership units are held by FCAM, 30% of A units by Kendray Properties Limited, 22.5% of B units are held by Leo No and 7.5% of B units are held by Ivor Smith the latter three being collectively known as the REIT Parties.
A units entitle the holder to profits earned by the overseas sub-group within F&C REIT while B units entitle the holder to profits earned by the other entities within this Group.
For each financial year ending on or before 31 December 2014 in which the Earnings Before Interest Taxation Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA of F&C REIT is 45 million or more, FCAM will transfer 3.33% of the total of A and B units in F&C REIT to the REIT Parties, subject to a maximum aggregate transfer of 10%.
The F&C REIT members generally share in the capital, profits and losses of F&C REIT Group in proportion to their respective ownership interests in F&C REIT.
However, where certain EBITDA targets are met in any financial year ending on or before 31 December 2013, the REIT Parties may be entitled to receive an uplift in their profit allocation for that year, subject to having a maximum profit allocation of 45% in any financial year.
F&C REIT is governed by the F&C REIT Board, comprising Leo No, Ivor Smith, Nick Criticos, Alain Grisay and David Logan.

While FCAM transferred F&C PAM, a subsidiary undertaking, to F&C REIT, it retains a 70% beneficial holding in F&C PAM via its 70% holding in F&C REIT.
The total consideration paid by the Group for its 70% holding in F&C REIT was as follows: m Initial consideration cash 25.0 Initial consideration loan notes 35.0 Fair value of consideration in respect of relinquishment of 30% of F&C PAM 28.2 Fair value of consideration paid for 70% of the REIT Group 88.2 Estimated expenses of acquisition of which 0.2m was accrued at 31 December 2008 4.4 Total consideration 92.6 The provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as at 31 December 2008 were as follows: Provisional fair value to the Group at acquisition, as Book Acquired Fair value at 31 December value intangibles adjustments 2008 m m m m Non-current assets: Property, plant and equipment 0.6 0.6 Intangible assets management contracts 34.0 71.3 34.0 71.3 Current assets: Trade and other receivables 0.9 0.2 1.1 Cash and short-term deposits 0.2 0.2 Non-current liabilities: Deferred tax 20.0 20.0 Current liabilities: Trade and other payables 0.9 0.9 Current tax payable 0.1 0.1 Estimated net assets acquired 34.7 51.3 33.8 52.2 Less: Minority interests share of net assets 15.6 Goodwill 56.0 Total consideration 92.6 As part of the transaction, the fair value of the combined business was agreed as follows: m Fair value of F&C PAM 94.1 Fair value of REIT Group 126.0 Total value of combined business 220.1 m F&Cs 70% share of the combined business 154.1 The REIT Parties have the right to require F&C to acquire all or part of their membership interests in F&C REIT at a valuation determined by an independent valuer, subject to an overall cap on F&Cs liability of 100.0 million.
Leo Nos option is exercisable after the seventh anniversary of Completion and Ivor Smiths option is exercisable after the third anniversary of Completion.
While Kendray Properties Limited does not have any direct right to require F&C to acquire its holding in F&C REIT, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement Kendray cannot hold a greater interest in F&C REIT than the aggregate of Leo Nos and Ivor Smiths interests or the holder of their beneficial interests and is therefore effectively required to transfer an element of its holding such that this requirement is achieved.
The consideration for such a transfer would be fair value.
Hence, in determining the gross liability of the option, Kendray Properties Limiteds entire holding in F&C REIT has been included.
The option liabilities are given in note 30.

Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries continued a 2008 Acquisition of REIT Property Asset Management Group continued On Completion, this option was recognised as a liability of 66.0m, being the fair value of 30% of F&C REIT at the time, with the initial charge being taken to equity.
The following adjustments were made to the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired: An adjustment of 0.2m was made in respect of an estimation of the additional cash which the minority partners will require to inject into the business in accordance with the transaction agreements.
The amount of 34.0m was excluded from the fair value of intangible assets acquired and replaced by the recognition of 71.3m for REIT management contracts, being their fair value at acquisition.
Further details of intangible assets are given in note 14.
The value of goodwill arising on acquisition took account of the value of the property asset management team acquired and the value of future new business flows.
The fair values of the net assets acquired were provisional until the REIT Completion Accounts review process was finalised in 2009.
The adjustments noted above reflected the Directors best estimates of the necessary fair value adjustments to the net assets of the acquired entities.
No provisions for re-organisation or restructuring costs were included in the liabilities of the acquired entities.
The profit before tax attributable to the acquired element of the F&C REIT Group for the period between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2008 was 3.2m.
As a result of the acquired entities not being operated as a Group prior to acquisition and the associated restructuring which was performed before the acquisition by F&C, it is not possible to determine what the Group results and cashflows would have been had the acquisition been completed on 1 January 2008. b 2009 Acquisition of REIT Property Asset Management Group Note 16 a provides the disclosure given in the 2008 financial statements in respect of the acquisition of REIT, including the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired.
This note provides further analysis of the adjustments made during 2009 to determine the final fair values of the net assets acquired.
Provisional fair Final fair value value to the Group 2009 to the Group at at acquisition, as at Fair value acquisition, as at 31 December 2008 adjustments 31 December 2009 m m m Non-current assets: Property, plant and equipment 0.6 0.6 Intangible assets management contracts 71.3 71.3 Current assets: Trade and other receivables 1.1 0.2 1.3 Cash and short-term deposits 0.2 0.2 Non-current liabilities: Deferred tax 20.0 20.0 Current liabilities: Trade and other payables 0.9 0.2 1.1 Current tax payable 0.1 0.1 Net assets acquired 52.2 52.2 Less: Minority interests share of net assets 15.6 15.6 Goodwill 56.0 56.0 Total consideration 92.6 92.6 m m m Discharged by: Initial consideration cash 25.0 25.0 Initial consideration loan notes 35.0 35.0 Fair value of consideration in respect of relinquishment of 30% of F&C PAM 28.2 28.2 Fair value of consideration paid for 70% of the REIT Group 88.2 88.2 Expenses of acquisition of which 0.1m is accrued at 31 December 2009: 31 December 2008: 0.2m 4.4 4.4 92.6 92.6 The additional 2009 fair value adjustments are explained below: Trade and other payables have been increased to reflect additional obligations of the acquired entities which existed at 3 September 2008, but which were not reflected in the Completion Accounts.
There have been some reallocations between trade and other receivables and trade and other payables to reflect classification changes and offsetting of similar items.
An adjustment of 0.5m, to a total of 0.7m, has been made in respect of the additional cash which the minority partners are required to inject into the business in accordance with the net assets adjustments mechanism transaction agreements.
This mechanism was set to ensure the net assets contribution of each party was in equal proportions to their holding in F&C REIT.
Therefore, the final fair value of assets acquired on acquisition 52.2m remained unchanged from the initial amount recognised in the 2008 Financial Statements.

Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries continued c Loss on partial disposal of property business As noted above, on 3 September 2008 the Group effectively disposed of 30% of its property business via the relinquishment of its ownership of F&C PAM.
The loss on disposal is quantified below: 2008 m Fair value of deemed consideration on disposal of 30% of F&C PAM 28.2 Less: Share of net assets attributable to 30% of F&C PAM, being transferred to minority interests 1.5 Less: Goodwill attributable to share of business transferred 30.8 Loss on disposal 4.1 d Acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited Following the review of the Completion Accounts and subsequent fair value adjustments to the purchase consideration for the acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited on 11 October 2004, there is an estimated further consideration of 0.7m payable to Eureko B. V. at 31 December 2009 31 December 2008: 2.9m.

These costs are amortised over the expected terms of the contracts, in line with the initial fees received from investors, as disclosed in note 29.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities a Recognised deferred assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: December 2009 December 2008 Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net m m m m m m Employee benefits 15.3 15.3 9.0 9.0 Share-based payments 12.4 12.4 9.7 9.7 Unused tax losses 0.6 0.6 Property, plant and equipment 2.6 2.6 2.5 2.5 Receivables, payables & provisions 3.4 3.4 5.3 5.3 Intangible assets management contracts 57.7 57.7 74.5 74.5 Unrealised fair value gains on available for sale assets 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 Unremitted overseas earnings 1.9 1.9 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 34.3 58.3 24.0 26.5 77.0 50.5 Includes 12.9m 31 December 2008: 5.9m relating to deferred tax on defined benefit pension deficit.
The Directors believe, based on Board approved budgets and forecasts, that it is appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets at the reporting date because it is considered probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they cannot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in companies that have not reported taxable profits for some time.
Financial instruments a Analysis of assets and liabilities at the reporting date Financial investments held in relation to the activities of the Groups insurance subsidiary have been classified as fair value through profit or loss within current assets.
Stocks of units and shares are held in relation to fund management activities and are classified as held for trading within current assets.
Financial investments included within non-current assets are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value or amortised cost if fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Other loans and receivables included within non-current assets are carried at amortised cost.

Financial instruments continued Financial instruments relating to unit-linked contracts The Groups insurance subsidiary, F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited, provides unit-linked pension wrappers.
From F&Cs perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management, as the financial risks and rewards attributable to the assets invested fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the Groups clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of this subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact on the level of management fees which are earned from this entity and which are directly affected by the underlying value of policyholder assets.
While F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited has some insurance risks, these risks are fully reinsured, thereby negating any net insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The amounts included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit-linked funds are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 m m Fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments designated as fair value through profit or loss 624.9 709.8 Loans and receivables: Deferred acquisition costs 0.1 0.2 Trade and other receivables 0.3 0.7 Cash and cash equivalents 24.6 43.6 Trade and other payables 1.2 Total unit-linked assets less liabilities 649.9 753.1 The above does not include 3.1m of non-linked policyholders cash 31 December 2008: 3.1m.

The Purchased Equity Plan represents investments held by an Employee Benefit Trust in F&C funds for the purpose of future settlement of Purchased Equity Plan awards.
A corresponding liability is recognised over the vesting period: details are given in note 28 d ii.

Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Financial instruments continued Sensitivities for level 3 While the Group believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.
Potential changes in the assumptions used in the valuation of level 3 financial assets are not considered to have a material impact on the Income Statement.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table: Securities The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of unlisted investments has been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and in accordance with the underlying limited partnership agreements.
Interest bearing loans and non-equity shares The fair value of the Subordinated Notes and Guaranteed Loan Notes is based on a quoted market price at the reporting date.
The fair value of other borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar instruments available in the market and the liquidity of assets and liabilities.
Unquoted investments Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the reporting date.
Put options Based on an external valuation of the business, as detailed in note 30.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is based on relevant exchange rates at the reporting dates.

This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied or are partially occupied by the Group.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to 11 years, although a significant element of this provision relates to lease incentive arrangements and is expected to be utilised within 4 years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases, and the majority of subleases, are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
One sub-lease involves the possible receipt of contingent rent.
Any contingent rent received in excess of the anticipated amount is recognised as income during the period.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time including market rent reviews and break-options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.
NIC on share schemes The provision for national insurance contributions NIC on share schemes represents the potential NIC liabilities in respect of a number of sharebased payment schemes operated by the Group.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the extent to which performance conditions are met, movements in the Companys share price, the extent to which awards lapse and, where eligible, the timing of when employees choose to exercise options.
The current element of the provision for NIC on share schemes relates to awards which are expected to vest within one year.
At 31 December 2009 3.1m 31 December 2008: 3.2m of financial investments were held by the Group to partially fund the NIC liability on the Deferred Investment Plan and Deferred Investment Option Plan.
This is disclosed in note 19.
Long-term sickness The Group has long-term sickness insurance arrangements which cover the cost of absence from work of all current employees.
However, the cost of employees who went on long-term absence prior to these arrangements being established are self-insured by the Group.
The provision represents the present value of income protection payments due to these individuals.
F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 88 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 26.
Provisions continued This provision has been quantified on the assumption that all employees currently on long-term sick leave do not return to the employment of the Group.
The discount rate and salary growth assumptions used in each year are identical to those used for the purposes of determining UK defined benefit pension obligations.
Guaranteed product The provision for the guaranteed product represents the actuarially assessed cost of meeting potential obligations under certain investment products which have a guaranteed payout in the event of death of the investor.
This provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of movements in market levels and the mortality rates of investors.
The underlying investment plan was closed to new investors during 2004.
Long-term service award This provision represents the non-current obligation in respect of long-term service benefits to which some employees are entitled, including incremental holiday entitlement and long-term service awards.
Investment Trust VAT In November 2007, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC agreed that asset management services to UK Investment Trust Companies ITCs should be exempt from VAT.
A number of Group companies, in common with other asset managers in the UK, received claims from ITCs for the repayment of VAT charged to them for historic periods dating back to 1990.
While the Group charged VAT in accordance with applicable UK law at the time, a provision was recognised in 2007 to the extent that the expected payments to be made to ITCs were greater than the expected amount recoverable from HMRC.
During 2008 and 2009, monies refunded from HMRC were paid, as required, to ITCs.
However, due to the complexity of the repayment process and its interaction with contractual arrangements, uncertainty existed at 31 December 2008 as to the final cost to be incurred by the Group.
During 2009 all amounts due to ITCs have been settled and the remainder of the provision of 2.6m was released to the Income Statement.
No provision is therefore required at 31 December 2009.
Put option claim During 2009 the two individual founder members of F&C Partners LLP LLP, the Groups fund of hedge funds business, sought to exercise put options to sell their minority interest in the LLP to the F&C corporate member under the terms of the LLP Agreement in total, for approximately 7.8m.
On 6 March 2009 the corporate member issued a claim in the High Court seeking a declaration on the validity of the exercise of the put options.
The individual members are seeking an unspecified sum by way of counterclaim.
On 10 June 2009 the individual founder members issued a petition against the LLP and the F&C corporate member under Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985 seeking an order that the F&C corporate member buy out their minority interest in the LLP at a price to be determined.
At the date of these Financial Statements, directions have been given by the High Court that the two actions be heard together going forward.
In addition the two founder partners may exercise further put options in October 2010 and if they do so the price formula in the LLP Agreement would produce an aggregate exercise price of a maximum of 2.4m.
Upon exercise of these options the LLP Agreement provides that the LLP may sell its business and if this is completed within 12 months the individuals concerned would then become entitled only to a proportion of the sale proceeds.
The Board has been advised by leading counsel that there is considerable uncertainty about whether these options could ever be completed.
Notwithstanding this uncertainty and having regard to the amount which would be payable under the October 2010 options, the Board has decided to provide for an amount of 2.4m in respect of this matter.
The Group will continue to defend its position vigorously and is advised that it should be successful in respect of all claims.
Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and participates in one in Portugal.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to the Group.
The former Chairman of the Group, Mr R W Jenkins, has a pension entitlement of 100,000 per annum, commencing on his 60th birthday.
This pension will be indexed in line with the Retail Price Index on 1 January each year with effect from 11 October 2004, the date of the pension award.
The Group has not earmarked any assets to date with respect to this liability.
The net pension deficit is recognised under non-current liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and is stated gross of the related deferred tax asset.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations were updated at 31 December 2009 by qualified independent actuaries.

Expected long-term rates of return applied to UK funded defined benefit assets are as follows: 31 December 31 December Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 2009 2008 Equities 7.00% 7.00% Government bonds 5.00% 5.00% LDI Pools 4.20% 3.30% Cash 0.50% 2.00% Other 7.00% 7.00% Basis used to determine the expected rate of return on plan assets To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the actual asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
b Major assumptions used by schemes actuaries in respect of benefit obligations i Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used for the main UK defined benefit scheme and the unfunded UK obligation are: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Mortality table for males retiring in the future PMA92MCYOB 1 PMA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for females retiring in the future PFA92MCYOB 1 PFA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for current male pensioners PMA92MCYOB 1 PMA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for current female pensioners PFA92MCYOB 1 PFA92MCYOB 1 The mortality assumptions for the overseas schemes are: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Netherlands Prognosetafel 2008 2053 Prognosetafel 2008 2050 generational table generational table Ireland Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates Portugal Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years In 2009 the mortality assumption of the F&C Ireland pension fund was updated.
There was a change in the compulsory purchase annuity rates used to value liabilities for 2009, with the new rates allowing for more conservative mortality rates.

Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations continued ii Impact of mortality assumptions To demonstrate what these mortality assumptions mean in respect of the FCAM Plan, the expected ages at death of members retiring at age 60 are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Years Years Expected age at death for a male retiring in the future at age 60 89 89 Expected age at death for a female retiring in the future at age 60 92 92 Expected age at death for a current male pensioner aged 60 88 88 Expected age at death for a current female pensioner aged 60 91 91 iii Cost of annuities The table below summarises the cost of providing annuities of 1 per annum with associated death benefits and pension increases for UK members aged 60 based on the assumptions used for the pension disclosures: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Male annuity 24.30 21.30 Female annuity 24.00 21.10 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 5.7% 2008: 6.10% based, with appropriate adjustments, on the iBoxx over 15 year AA corporate bond index of 5.66% 2008: 6.71%.
The rates also assume two thirds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse: a 5-year guarantee is provided: and pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension will increase by 3.6% 2008: 3.10% per annum.
iv Discount and growth assumptions The range of assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.50% 5.70% 5.70% 6.10% Rate of salary increase 2.50% 4.85% 2.50% 4.35% Rate of inflation increase 2.00% 3.60% 2.00% 3.10% The range of assumptions used to determine net pension cost for the year are as follows: 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.70% 6.10% 5.50% 5.60% Weighted average expected long-term return on plan assets 4.80% 5.70% 5.50% 6.30% Rate of inflation increase 2.50% 4.35% 2.00% 3.30% Rate of salary increase 2.00% 3.10% 2.50% 4.55% v Sensitivities An estimate of the sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Estimated impact on scheme liabilities Inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.7% Salaries Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 0.4% Pensions Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.2% Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 2.3% Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increase decrease by 2.2% c Profile of schemes membership The profile of the current membership of defined benefit arrangements in the Group is as follows: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 % of total Average % of total Average membership age membership age Active members 17% 42 20% 41 Deferred members 71% 42 69% 42 Pensioners 12% 65 11% 65 100% 100% The profile of the liabilities of defined benefit arrangements throughout the Group is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Active members 59.7 49.1 Deferred members 94.4 73.3 Pensioners 50.1 45.5 Benefit obligations at 31 December 204.2 167.9 F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 91 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 27.

The FCAM Plans assets, which are managed by F&C, are held under the control of the Trustees and are used to secure benefits for the members of the FCAM Plan and their dependants in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules.
Trustee Board of the FCAM Plan The appointment of Trustees is determined by the FCAM Plans trust documentation.
The Trustee Board currently consists of three employerappointed Trustees, three member-selected Trustees and two independent Trustees, one of whom is currently the Chairman of the Trustee Board.
Of the current employer-appointed and member-selected Trustees, four are employees of F&C and active members of the FCAM Plan, one is a deferred member and one is retired and receiving a pension from the FCAM Plan.
Relationship between F&C and the Trustees of the FCAM Plan The FCAM Plans assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the FCAM Plan are required to act in the best interests of the FCAM Plans beneficiaries.
ii Other pension schemes F&C Portugal Certain employees in Portugal participate in the multi-employer scheme, Fundo fide Pensoes do Grupo Banco Comercial Portugus.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are separately identifiable.
There are no Trustees, and the Company controls the assets relating to the F&C members of the scheme.
F&C Netherlands The Plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
There are no Trustees, but the Works Council participates in negotiations in respect of potential changes to the Plan.
F&C Ireland The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Ireland.
There are currently four Trustees of this plan, all of whom are employees of F&C.
f Future funding requirements UK schemes A revised schedule of contributions was agreed in June 2008.
The Group has paid contributions in line with, or in excess of, this schedule since its adoption.
The Group agreed to pay contributions of a minimum of 29.6% of Pensionable Salaries until 1 March 2009 and 28.1% of Pensionable Salaries thereafter.
The Group agreed to pay an additional 5.0m per annum between 1 July 2009 until the completion of the 31 March 2010 valuation.
Employee contributions are payable via a salary sacrifice scheme in addition to the Group contributions.
The rates of employee contributions payable increased on a phased basis until March 2009.
Contributions are subject to review at future actuarial valuations.
The minimum estimated contribution expected to be paid into the Plan during 2010 is 7.4m 2009: 3.8m.
As the FCAM Plan is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.
F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 93 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 27.
Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations continued With effect from 1 March 2010 changes were made to the benefits granted under the FCAM Plan in respect of both past and future service for current active members.
A limit of 2% per annum was imposed on future increases in Pensionable Salary.
To facilitate this an underpin was introduced so that members benefits accrued prior to 1 March 2010 will not be less than that they would have received if they had left service on 28 February 2010.
In addition, in respect of service after 28 February 2010 only, the level of guaranteed increases in pension after retirement was reduced and some members were given a choice between increasing the level of their contributions or having their normal pension age increased to 65.
These changes are expected to reduce the pension cost recognised in the Income Statement in future years, particularly in 2010 when the effect of the changes on past service will be recognised.
Overseas schemes The figures in the table below assume that contributions will continue to be paid to the overseas schemes at the level paid in 2009, with appropriate increases for future changes in salary assumptions.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: Contributions paid m 2008 7.4 2009 6.6 Expected future contributions m 2010 8.5 2011 8.4 2012 8.4 2013 8.5 2014 8.6 Assumes the 5.0m additional annual payment into the FCAM Plan continues after 2010. g Risk management i FCAM Plan The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the FCAM Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment adviser and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment manager.
The performance objectives are long-term, however, the Trustees monitor the investment manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that the scheme is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
The results of an asset-liability review undertaken alongside the 31 March 2007 actuarial valuation of the plan was used to assist the Trustees and the Group in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the FCAM Plans deficit by providing information used to determine the FCAM Plans investment strategy.
Asset allocation The Trustees, with the agreement of F&C, decided to introduce more diversification into the FCAM Plans return-seeking asset investment strategy.
At the present time, one additional diversifying allocation, to a private equity fund, has been made.
Previously the Trustees have implemented a Liability Driven Investment LDI approach to the investment strategy.
Other allocations to alternative asset classes may be made in the future.
Interest rate and inflation risk The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the FCAM Plan.
Each pool comprises zero coupon derivatives with the same maturity as the expected cash flows of the scheme.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the FCAM Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the FCAM Plans liabilities are denominated entirely in Sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas equities.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the FCAM Plans securities.
These are held by an external custodian.
The assets are ring fenced from F&Cs creditors and therefore transferable.

Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations continued ii Overseas schemes The plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance company.
The value of the plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are, in effect, fixed interest instruments, so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The plan in Ireland invests in pooled unitised funds, with returns reflecting the performance of the underlying assets.
The plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
At 31 December 2009, the assets of both the F&C Portugal and F&C Ireland plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.

The details of each scheme are disclosed below.
Details of option pricing models and key assumptions used to obtain the fair value of services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, have been disclosed only for awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2009.
Details of awards granted in previous accounting periods are disclosed in the previous years Financial Statements.
The fair value of services received in return for awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The cash-settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The value of dividend payments has been separated from the equity-settled awards as these are settled in cash.
The cumulative grant expense for each award is trued up, during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period, after allowing for actual forfeitures and, where applicable, the performance criteria being met.

The TSR target is dependent upon the TSR of the Group compared to the TSR of the other companies who formed the FTSE 250 Index at the start of each performance period the comparator companies over a three year performance period commencing on the first day of the accounting period in which the award was made.
At the end of the performance period, the Group and each of the comparator companies the comparator list are listed and ranked in accordance with their TSR over the performance period.
The number of Ordinary Shares which vest would depend upon the ranking of the Group in the comparator list, in accordance with the vesting table above, described as follows: For below median TSR performance, no awards would vest: for TSR performance between the median and upper quartile 125th and 63rd position in the comparator list index, awards would vest on a straight-line basis between 35% for median and 100% for upper quartile.
The TSR measure reflects the movement in the value of shares plus any dividends declared during the relevant period.
It was chosen as the performance measure for the LTRP as it is directly related to movements in shareholder value.
For levels of both TSR and underlying EPS performance between those shown in the tables above, any award that vests under the LTRP will vary on a straight-line basis between the minimum and maximum levels shown.
The number of restricted share awards is as follows: 2009 2008 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 843,829 852,656 Lapsed during the year 516,281 Forfeited during the year 8,827 Outstanding at 31 December 327,548 843,829 No awards were made in 2009 or 2008.
The EPS and TSR elements of the awards granted on 17 May 2006 did not meet the respective criteria and lapsed.
At 31 December 2009 the following LTRP restricted share awards were outstanding: No.

The awards outstanding at 31 December 2009 have a weighted average outstanding term of 0.2 years 31 December 2008: 0.7 years.
The estimate of the fair value of awards granted is measured at full market value for the EPS criteria and no valuation model is used for this element.
Monte Carlo Simulation is used to value the TSR criteria.
The contractual life of the award 3 years is used as an input to the TSR model.

Employee benefits Share-based payments continued b The Executive Director Remuneration Plan EDRP Any Executive Director of the Company is eligible to participate in the EDRP.
The EDRP provides for the grant of two different forms of award, Restricted Share Awards and Deferred Share Awards.
i Deferred Share Awards Awards vest at the end of a three year period from grant date, subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no performance criteria attached to the deferred shares and the vested shares transfer to the participant as soon as possible after vesting.
The number of Deferred Share Awards is as follows: 2009 2008 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 2,526,214 1,500,574 Granted during the year 2,188,992 1,025,640 Outstanding at 31 December 4,715,206 2,526,214 No awards were exercised during 2009 or were exercisable at either 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2009 the following EDRP Deferred Share Awards were outstanding: No.
of awards Earliest Exercise Grant date outstanding exercise date price 21 May 2007 1,500,574 10 May 2010 0.0p 25 March 2008 1,025,640 25 March 2011 0.0p 8 July 2009 2,188,992 8 July 2012 0.0p The awards outstanding at 31 December 2009 have a weighted average outstanding term of 1.6 years 31 December 2008: 1.8 years.
During 2009 the rules of the Executive Director Remuneration Plan were amended to allow acceleration of prior year awards.
These changes allow participants to exchange existing awards under these plans for F&C Asset Management plc shares subject to restrictions, allowing more flexibility for employees over the timing of their income tax charge.
The restrictions mirror the original restrictions on the share awards including the forfeiture provisions.
Other than the basis of personal taxation, the terms of conditions of the awards remain the same.
ii Restricted Share Awards The vesting of the Restricted Share Awards is dependent on the satisfaction of pre-determined performance conditions relating to the underlying Earnings Per Share underlying EPS performance of the Group.
Under this condition, a Restricted Share Award will only vest if the Groups underlying EPS equals or exceeds the specified target for the year ending 31 December 2009.
On achievement of the specified target, 100% of the award will vest.
The participant can earn a maximum enhanced level of vesting of 140% of the award by achieving an extremely stretching level of underlying EPS.
Where the actual underlying EPS exceeds the minimum vesting conditions but is less than the maximum enhanced level of vesting, then the percentage of the award that vests will be calculated on a straight-line basis between 100% and 140%.
The 2007 Restricted Share Award is subject to the following EPS hurdle: Underlying EPS for the year ending 31 December 2009 Percentage of Restricted Share Awards Vesting 18.1p 100% 25.2p 140% 18.1p 25.2p Pro-rata between 100% and 140% on a straight-line basis Following vesting, shares will be held by Trustees, in a nominee capacity, throughout a fixed holding period at the end of which the shares may be transferred to the participant.
The holding period applicable to 50% of such vested shares will end on announcement of the 2010 year end results: the balance of vested shares will be subject to a further six month holding period.
During the holding period the participant will be eligible to receive dividends and exercise voting rights.
The number of Restricted Share Awards is as follows: 3 years 3.5 years 2009 2008 2009 2008 No.
Outstanding at 1 January and 31 December # 2,002,000 2,002,000 2,002,000 2,002,000 # This represents the maximum number of restricted shares which could be achieved by the participants i. e. 140%.
No awards were made during 2009 or were exercisable at either 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2009 the following EDRP Restricted Share Awards were outstanding: No.

Employee benefits Share-based payments continued c F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP In accordance with the F&C REIT Partnership Agreement, the F&C REIT minority partners Kendray Properties Limited, Leo No and Ivor Smith have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT collectively from 30% to 40%.
A variable minority interest was granted as an incentive to achieve increased levels of profit including realisation of future performance fees in return for a potential increased stake in the business.
This variable minority interest is therefore accounted for under IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the award at date of acquisition reflects the value assessed as part of the acquisition valuation.
The fair value of the award is reassessed at each reporting date and this fair value will be spread over the relevant vesting period.
The minority partners have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT by 3.33% for every year in which the EBITDA performance target of 45.0m is achieved, up to a maximum of 10%, for example, if the target was achieved in the first three years, no further increase would be possible.
The variable minority interest performance criteria could be achieved in any year of the six year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014.
The vesting period is uncertain but the maximum timescale to achieve full vesting for each 3.33% is in years 4, 5 and 6 respectively.
The Directors have continued to assume that 3.33% will vest in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014 in full.
The expense for each tranche is being spread from the date of grant 3 September 2008 over 4, 5 and 6 years respectively.
However, the respective vesting period may be accelerated if the targets are achieved earlier.
If either Leo No or Ivor Smith should leave during this period, the variable minority interest could still convert to all the minority partners, so the remaining charge would be accelerated, subject to meeting the performance criteria.
The additional minority interest to which the minority partners would be entitled will be in proportion to their original partnership interest at the date of vesting.
If a partner left after one year he would sacrifice two thirds of his interest.
If a partner stays three years he is entitled to his proportionate share of the full 10%, subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Kendrays minority interest always varies in accordance with the underlying interests of Leo No and Ivor Smith.
Any variable minority interest sacrificed by a minority partner will remain part of FCAM plcs share of F&C REIT.
As the performance criteria is non-market based, to the extent that part or all of the performance criteria is not met then that proportion of the charge will be reversed, i. e. trued up.
It is still considered likely that the full conversion will be achieved.
Therefore the IFRS 2 charge to the Income Statement assumes full vesting.
d Purchased Equity Plan PEP i F&C Asset Management plc shares The PEP operates in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and is intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of the Group by providing for: The compulsory purchase of shares using annual bonus above a threshold level: and Voluntary purchase of shares using annual bonus, with associated Matching Shares.
No Voluntary Purchased Equity awards have been granted.
At the Boards discretion, eligible employees who are awarded in a financial year an aggregate bonus in excess of a threshold level of 100,000 2008: 100,000 will be required to defer one third of the element exceeding 100,000 2008: 100,000 into shares comprising either a range of investment products managed by the Group or the Companys shares Compulsory PEP for three years.
The Compulsory PEP will not benefit from any form of matching award and is subject to forfeiture in the event that the employee leaves the Group for any reason other than as a good leaver in the three year retention period.
The number of Compulsory PEP share awards is as follows: 2009 2008 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 1,975,594 2,471,588 Granted during the year 213,761 89,371 Exercised during the year 792,495 541,511 Forfeited during the year 43,854 Outstanding at 31 December 1,396,860 1,975,594 Exercisable at 31 December 41,044 15,503 The 24 March 2006 award vested on 24 March 2009.
The awards exercisable at 31 December 2009 relate to good leavers.

The awards outstanding at 31 December 2009 have a weighted average outstanding term of 0.6 years 31 December 2008: 0.9 years.
ii F&C Investment Funds A new element was introduced into the PEP in 2007 whereby, at the discretion of the Board, the cash bonus is deferred on a mandatory basis into certain F&C Funds Compulsory Purchased Equity subject to continued service over either three or four years.
This option is now available in addition to the Compulsory PEP into FCAM plc shares.
The main benefit of this arrangement is to incentivise fund managers to invest in the funds they manage, thereby further aligning employee interests with those of clients.
The settlement of awards from the Compulsory PEP F&C Investment Funds is made by realisation of the holding in the fund at the vesting date and purchase of FCAM plc shares at that date.
The value of the investment in F&C Funds, the FCAM plc share price and hence the ultimate number of FCAM plc shares to be settled is only known with certainty at the vesting date.
Any dividends paid during the vesting period are used to buy further underlying F&C Investment Funds shares.
Although the awards meet the criteria of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment as the awards are ultimately settled in FCAM plc shares, it is not considered possible to reliably estimate the fair value of these awards at the grant date.
This is due to the number of market based criteria which ultimately combine to determine the number and value of FCAM plc shares settled.
Settlement of these awards to employees is satisfied by the purchase of FCAM plc shares in the market.
The fair value of these awards at the year end has been determined by measurement of the equity instruments at intrinsic value, being the quoted price of the relevant F&C Funds, both at the grant date and at each subsequent reporting date.
The intrinsic value is then spread over the vesting period.
The value of the services provided is measured using the ultimate value of awards which vest.
Awards totalling 1.0m were made on 2 April 2009 2 April 2008: 2.5m.
These awards were invested into a total of 14 2 April 2008: 24 eligible F&C Investment Funds, comprising OEICs and Investment Trusts.
The underlying investments are held within an Employee Benefit Trust.

Employee benefits Share-based payments continued f Share Save Scheme The Share Save Scheme is an all-employee share scheme which was activated in March 2003.
The options granted entitle the holders to acquire Ordinary Shares, whether by subscription or purchase, at a price per Ordinary Share determined by the Directors prior to the issue of invitations.
The price at which options are offered cannot be less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an Ordinary Share at the date of grant.
No cash alternative is available.
As part of the application process, participants are required to enter into a savings contract with a savings provider presently Yorkshire Building Society, and agree to make 36 in the case of a 3-year savings contract or 60 in the case of a 5-year contract monthly savings contributions of a fixed amount.
At the end of the savings contract, participants may choose to apply for repayment of their savings contributions, in addition to a tax free bonus.
An option may only be exercised once and normally only during the period of six months after the date on which the participants first become entitled to repayment of their savings contributions plus bonus.
The option will generally lapse after a period of six months following the end of the savings contract.
Employees who are deemed good leavers are entitled to exercise their options, for which they have accrued savings to date, for a period of up to six months after they leave.
The number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options are as follows: 2009 2008 WAEP WAEP No.
The 19 April 2004 5 year award and 18 April 2006 3 year award vested during 2009.
The options exercisable at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 relate to good leavers.
At 31 December 2009 the following options granted under the Share Save Scheme to acquire Ordinary Shares were outstanding: No.
The estimate of the fair value of options granted is measured based on a Binomial model.
The contractual life of the option 3.5 or 5.5 years is used as an input to this model.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the model.
g 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme The 2002 Executive Share Option scheme 2002 ESOS was activated in March 2003.
The vesting period for each award was three years and options are settled by an allotment of shares to individuals.
All options under the 2002 ESOS have now vested, as the performance criteria has been met.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of award, the options expire.

h 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme IFRS 2 Share-based Payment is only applied to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 i. e. the effective date of IFRS 2.
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS last granted options before 7 November 2002 and is not therefore subject to the full effects of IFRS 2 in terms of recognising an expense in the Income Statement.
The standard does, however, require certain disclosures to be made in respect of this Scheme.
The 1995 ESOS is an unapproved share option scheme, where participation was entirely at the discretion of the Directors.
The lifespan of the Scheme was ten years from the date on which it was approved by shareholders and accordingly no further options can be granted under the Scheme after 1 September 2005.
The vesting period was three years and all options are exercisable.
Options are settled by grant of shares to individuals.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.

The above liabilities reflect the fair value of unrealised losses on open contracts at the reporting date, based on observable foreign exchange rates.
The F&C REIT put options represent the fair value of the potential future liability to purchase the 30% interest in F&C REIT currently held by the minority interest partners in this business.
The reduction in the fair value of the F&C REIT put options of 5.6m between 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 has been released to the Income Statement.
Details of these options are disclosed in note 16 a.
An external valuation of the F&C REIT business was performed at 31 December 2009 to enable a fair value to be placed on the F&C REIT put option liabilities.
The average of three valuation methodologies equally weighted was used to place a fair value on the F&C REIT business, namely: 1.
Market earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA multiple 3.
Fixed EBITDA multiple The main assumptions used in the valuation methodologies are: a Projections of the profit and loss for F&C REIT: Revenue Growth: 1.5% 7.5% per annum Cost inflation: 3.5% per annum b Discount Rates: 12.5% on recurring cash flows 25.0% on non-recurring cash flows c Perpetuity growth rates: 3.0% for recurring cash flows 3.0% for non-recurring cash flows d Earnings multipliers: 9.0 x recurring EBITDA 3.0 x non-recurring EBITDA 31.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of policyholder investments at the start and end of the year and an analysis of movements during the year are as follows: 2009 2008 Note m m Liability as at 1 January 753.1 1,090.1 Contributions received 67.5 197.1 Investment return applied 4 136.0 208.7 Charges levied 3.4 4.2 Repayments 303.2 268.6 Movement in contingency reserve 0.1 Movement in reinsurance ceded 52.6 Liability as at 31 December 649.9 753.1 All investment contract liabilities have been disclosed as due within one year as this is considered to be appropriate to the rights of policyholders who have the right to withdraw their investments at short notice.
The Directors expect that the majority of the investment contract liabilities will be repayable outwith one year.

Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liabilities include life assurance liabilities in respect of lifetime guarantees provided with certain investment products, and annuity liabilities in respect of pension investment contracts where the investor has retired.
These liabilities and related reinsurance balances at the start and end of the year, together with an analysis of movements in the year, are as follows: 2009 2008 Gross Reinsurance Net Gross Reinsurance Net m m m m m m At 1 January 2.1 2.1 2.3 2.3 Claims paid 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Change in economic assumptions 0.1 0.1 Unwinding of discount rate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other changes in year 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 At 31 December 1.9 1.9 2.1 2.1 The reinsurance liabilities relate to annuity business reinsured with Friends Provident Pensions Limited.
A liability adequacy test was carried out at policy level and resulted in no additional provision for either 2009 or 2008.
No significant gain or loss arose on reinsurance contracts incepted in 2009 or 2008.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used in determining the insurance contract liabilities and the reinsurers share of these liabilities, and the process adopted to arrive at these assumptions are as follows: Mortality rates 2009 2008 Annuities in payment 81-94% PCXA00 83-94% PCXA00 Due to the small number of annuity policies, the mortality assumptions reflect recent experience of the reinsurer together with an allowance for future mortality improvement.
Experience analysis for mortality is performed annually by the reinsurer.
Discount rate The discount rate used at 31 December 2009 is 5.21% 31 December 2008: 4.52% based on current fixed interest gross redemption yields, with a prudent adjustment for risk.

The Preference Share capital was repaid to Friends Provident plc in full on 16 July 2009, following the divestment by Friends Provident plc of its holding in FCAM plc on 3 July 2009.
As the Preference share capital was not cancelled with Court Approval, a Capital Redemption reserve was created to maintain the capital of the Company.
The key terms and conditions relating to these Preference shares were as follows: Dividends on the Cumulative Preference shares were paid in priority to any payment of dividend on any other class of shares.
On a return of assets on liquidation, the assets of the Company available for distribution would have been applied first in repaying the holders of the Cumulative Preference shares the amounts paid up or credited as paid up on such shares, together with any arrears of the dividend.
Holders of Cumulative Preference shares were entitled to one vote in instances where the dividend was six months in arrears or if a resolution put to the meeting varied or impacted the rights and privileges attached to these shares.
The terms of the Cumulative Preference shares conferred the right to receive a variable rate dividend on the amount paid up or credited as paid up on the Cumulative Preference shares at the rate of 2% per annum above the LIBOR rate expressed as a rate per annum at the commencement of each half-yearly dividend payment period.
Reserves The analysis of movements in reserves is disclosed within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 51.
Nature and purpose of reserves: Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital in excess of par value.
Capital Redemption reserve The Capital Redemption reserve is used to maintain the capital of the Company when Shares are bought back and subsequently cancelled without Court Approval.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The element of the merger reserve which relates to amortisation and impairment of intangible assets charged to the Income Statement is considered to be realised.
A transfer is made from the merger reserve to retained earnings to recognise the extent to which the merger reserve has been realised, thereby offsetting the corresponding element of the intangible amortisation and impairment charge.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements of foreign operations and non-Sterling denominated intangible assets.
Fair value reserve This reserve records fair value changes on available for sale investments until the investments are derecognised.
Acquisition reserve The acquisition reserve was created on the initial recognition of the F&C REIT minority interest put options liability.

Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to a number of business risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Groups risk management arrangements, but has delegated the implementation and operation of the Board policies to management.
The Groups risk management policies and the risk management framework for identifying, monitoring and managing risks across the Group, including strategic and operational risks, are detailed in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance on page 37.
The Directors consider it appropriate to differentiate between those financial risks which directly impact the Group and those which indirectly impact the Group due to the risks borne by our clients and the consequential impact on the Groups assets under management and revenues.
The Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial instruments arises from the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information on the Groups direct or indirect exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
Note 39 provides numerical analysis of the Groups financial instrument exposure to such risks, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at the reporting date.
Indirect earnings risk through client assets As an active fund manager, the Group is responsible for managing assets in accordance with the mandates specified by our clients.
The assets managed by the Group are subject to varying financial risks market, credit and liquidity.
While these risks could result in financial loss or gain through a change in asset value, these risks and rewards are fully borne by, or fall to the benefit of, our clients.
However, as the majority of the Groups revenues are quantified as a percentage of assets under management generally on a quarterly or monthly basis, the Groups income is impacted by movements in client assets which are caused by the exposure to financial risks.
As a result of the direct link of revenues to the value of client assets, the Groups interests are aligned to those of our clients.
A key risk to our business is that of poor investment performance, which could lead to the subsequent loss of client mandates.
A key role of the Heads of Equities and Fixed Income is to monitor the fund performance achieved by our investment professionals.
Where it is considered necessary, actions are taken to change process or personnel with a view to attaining top quartile performance.
The Group has the ability to earn performance fees from a number of our clients, where out-performance of the benchmark or set objective is achieved.
These arrangements reinforce the alignment of the Groups interests with those of our clients.
F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 107 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 38.
Financial risk management continued The key components of financial risk to which our clients are exposed are: Market risk the risk of financial loss arising from changes in the market prices of assets.
Market risks include exposure to all asset classes, including equities, fixed income products and property as well as currency risk and interest rate risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of assets held within client portfolios.
Credit risk can vary by asset class and individual instrument.
Liquidity risk the risk of financial loss to client portfolios because a counterparty does not have sufficient financial resources available and is unable to realise assets in order to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only realise assets by suffering financial loss.
Direct earnings and capital exposure The Group has direct exposure to the following risks in respect of financial instruments on the Statement of Financial Position: Market risk the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of financial instruments held by the Group.
Credit risk includes investment credit risk, counterparty risks, deposit and loan risks and country risks.
Liquidity risk the risk of the Group failing to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Group could be required to pay its liabilities earlier than expected or because of any inability to realise assets in order to meet obligations as they fall due or is only able to realise assets by suffering financial loss.
A fuller analysis of the financial risks associated with the Groups financial instruments, together with the objectives, policies and processes to manage the Groups exposure to those risks follows.
Unit-linked assets and liabilities A significant element of the value of the Groups financial assets relates to the Groups unit-linked pooled pension entity, F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited F&C MPF.
As outlined in note 19, Financial Instruments, the risks and rewards associated with these assets, which are held by F&C MPF, fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the underlying policyholders.
As a result, the investment contract liabilities included in the Statement of Financial Position are equal and opposite in value to the assets which are held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders.
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default, although the revenue stream earned from managing these assets varies in line with the movement in assets held on behalf of clients.
The financial risk management disclosures specifically exclude policyholders unit-linked assets and liabilities relating to F&C MPF as there is no direct exposure to the Group from the associated financial instruments.
Financial investments Recognising that the Groups revenue stream has significant financial exposure to fluctuations in assets managed on behalf of clients, a key principle of the Group Treasury Policy set by the Board is to restrict investment of the Groups assets to low risk deposits or money market instruments where the risk of capital loss is low, thereby seeking to protect the Groups capital.
Advanced Board approval is required for any investment or financial instrument which does not follow this general principle.
Group Treasury Policy allows up to 20m of the Groups cash resources to be utilised as seed capital to support the launch of new investment funds.
The policy permits seed capital to be invested in a maximum of two funds at any point in time, restricts the maximum initial investment to 10m in any one fund and targets divestment of seed capital no later than 12 months from the date of investment.
While no such investments were held at either 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008, investments totalling 14.8m were made during 2008 to facilitate the launch of new single strategy hedge funds, subsequently realising a gain of 5.3m on disposal of these investments in 2008.
Prior to 2008, the Group did not hedge any of its cash flow exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from any of these risks.
During 2008, following significant strengthening of the Euro against Sterling, the Groups reporting currency, the Group entered into a series of forward currency contracts to provide greater certainty over the Sterling value of some of the expected future Euro-denominated revenue streams, with the final contract maturing in June 2010.
Since these contracts were established, there has been a further strengthening of the Euro.
The Board continues to recognise that the Group has significant exposure to Euro-denominated cash flows, but at this point in time have not chosen to enter into any further medium-term forward exchange contracts.
During 2009 the Group recognised 5.8m of realised gains and 1.2m of unrealised gains in respect of these forward currency contracts.
These gains represented the partial reversal of the 12.3m of unrealised losses recognised as at 31 December 2008.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group has one remaining forward currency contract for c15m which matures on 30 June 2010, for which a liability of 1.3m is recognised at 31 December 2009 to reflect the unrealised loss on this contract.
Financial investments classified as available for sale, as detailed in note 15, reflect the value of the Groups private equity investments.
These primarily reflect carried interest entitlement which arises from the Groups historical ownership of private equity businesses.
The Board does not seek to manage any of the financial risks associated with these investments and recognises that uncertainty exists as to the quantum and timing of future distributions which may arise from these investments.
F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 108 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 38.
Financial risk management continued Other financial investments, classified as fair value through profit or loss, as detailed in note 19 a i, primarily comprise assets held in connection with current or historic employee remuneration arrangements.
The Group has no net financial exposure to Purchased Equity Plan and Bonus investments as the risks and rewards of all movements in the value of these financial assets fall to the beneficiary and are offset by equal and opposite movements in the Groups associated employee benefit liabilities, which accrue over the vesting period.
The NIC hedge economically hedges the Groups exposure to movements in future national insurance contributions obligations in respect of certain assets held by the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts.
Stock of units and shares The Group operates and manages a number of OEICs whose funds, into which retail and institutional investors can invest, have a wide range of investment objectives.
The Group holds a stock of units and shares in these OEIC funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management policy limits the aggregate value of the units held by the Group to 1.5m, thereby capping the maximum financial risk exposure associated with these assets.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised within net revenue in the Income Statement, but which have not been settled in cash.
The nature of F&Cs business is such that asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values, which once known, are billed to clients and are due to be settled in line with individual contractual terms.
As a result, the aggregate value of debtors and accrued income can typically represent up to four months of revenue at any point in time.
In addition, as most of the performance fees earned by the Group accrue in respect of the calendar year and can only be billed subsequently, the quantum of accrued income recognised in the Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date is generally higher than at other periods and is sensitive to the magnitude of performance fees earned.
"Before the Group takes on new clients, it undertakes the required ""Know Your Client"" procedures."
As the Group manages assets on behalf of clients and management fees are typically charged to and paid from the underlying funds managed by the Group, there is a relatively low risk of default on management fees.
The Group does not hold any credit insurance.
Due to the scale of some of F&Cs larger clients, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk from large clients or groups of connected clients, arising from timing difference between the recognition of income and the receipt of management fees outlined above.
Very few clients have an external credit rating.
Where management fees are denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the Group is exposed to currency risk.
As previously noted, prior to 2008 the Group did not hedge any of its exposure to monetary assets denominated in foreign currency.
At 31 December 2009, only c15m of future cash flows are covered by open forward currency contracts.
Other debtors Other debtors include Trustee debtors and Debtors due from investors in respect of the purchase of units.
In operating and managing OEICs, the Group seeks to match the purchase and sale of investments to align to the receipt or payment of funds from or to investors.
However, if these obligations are not matched then there is a requirement for the Group to fund any shortfall from its corporate cash resources.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved.
In the event that investors default on sums due, then the Group is entitled to reimbursement of costs from the investor.
Cash and cash equivalents F&C adopts a low risk approach to treasury management and seeks to ensure that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed appropriately.
The Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters defined by the Board.
The regulatory capital and treasury position of the Group are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Groups cash and cash equivalent assets are exposed to a number of financial risks in the normal course of its business.
The policy adopted is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specifically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below: Funds on deposit will only be placed on a short term basis maximum term 90 days to help maximise regulatory capital.
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the F&C Credit Committee, and the Board has set a 25.0m limit for the maximum exposure to any single counterparty.
The F&C Credit Committees primary focus is to assess the credit position of counterparties prior to placing any client assets with them and to monitor credit risk thereafter.
Exposure to cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currency is managed to reduce the risk of movements in exchange rates, where possible, by the repatriation of surplus foreign currency into Sterling.
This is achieved in practice via the regular settlement of the Groups transfer pricing arrangements and through the payment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, having regard to their respective, legal, regulatory and working capital requirements.
The timing of the conversion of Euro-denominated cash balances to Sterling is by necessity impacted by the settlement profile of the forward currency contracts.
F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 109 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 38.
Financial risk management continued Cash and deposit balances can be exposed to interest rate movements.
The Group utilises the experience and skills of its professional dealing team to obtain the best interest rates, ensuring the expected maturity dates of deposits are aligned to the Groups working capital requirements.
Recognising the scale and significance of the global financial crisis which arose during 2008, and which had consequential economic impacts through 2009, management sought to operate a maximum corporate exposure to any one financial institution of 15.0m, with prior approval required for a limited number of exceptions, as the objective of capital preservation was considered of greater importance than maximising the income generated from short-term deposits.
Reinsurance assets The Groups unit-linked pooled pension subsidiary is an insurance company and has some exposure to insurance contract liabilities, as outlined in note 32.
These liabilities are fully reinsured as the Group seeks to have no net insurance exposure.
The reinsurance assets represent the expected amounts recoverable to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has exposure to both credit and liquidity risk on these assets.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Groups defined benefit pension deficit represents the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of plan assets, details of which are given in note 27.
The Group has exposure to the movements in the market value of the plan assets, which include equities and LDI fixed interest pools.
of the assets held in respect of the UK scheme are held in LDI pools, with maturity profiles which match the expected maturity profile of pension obligations.
The market values of the LDI pools are impacted by movements in interest rates.
The value of defined benefit pension obligations is quantified and discounted using corporate bond rates.
Movements in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and hence the quantum of the Groups pension deficit.
Management of capital While F&C considers its capital to be its total equity, this is effectively managed via the net assets to which it relates.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board monitors significant movements in the composition of its shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in share capital are shown in the Report of the Directors on page 29.
In the ordinary course of business the only movements in the absolute number of shares in issue would be through the issue of new or own shares to satisfy obligations under share-based payment arrangements or through the purchase of own shares to satisfy future share scheme obligations.
The Directors give careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for financing all acquisitions, which historically have included both equity and debt funded transactions.
Dividends are only declared by the Board after due consideration of a number of key items, including the financial results and the future outlook of the financial position of the Company and of the Group.
The dividend policy seeks to achieve a targeted dividend cover of 1.5 times underlying profit.
The Board declared an unchanged total dividend of 6.0p per share for 2009.
As a result of the impact of extreme market conditions and continued corporate uncertainty, this resulted in a 2009 dividend cover of less than the 150% target.
The overall objective of shareholder liquidity risk management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity over short and medium time horizons to meet the needs of the business.
This includes liquidity to cover, among other things, capital expenditure, servicing debt and equity capital as well as working capital to fund the Groups day-to-day operational requirements.
The only security held over some of the Groups assets is in respect of the 10.0m Floating Rate Secured Notes which were issued during 2008 to partially finance the acquisition of REIT.
Working capital Working capital is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that settlement terms of all forthcoming liabilities can be met.
This activity includes timely collection of debtors and monitoring of cash on deposit, having regard to regulatory capital requirements, as outlined below.
The Groups Finance function includes a Treasury team which manages the cash-flow requirements of the Group while seeking to maximise the amount of cash on deposit.
The Group also has bank overdraft facilities available to it which provide some protection against any short-term cash-flow deficiencies.
The undrawn committed facilities available at the reporting date are shown in note 24 as are details of the Groups interest bearing loans and borrowings.
During 2009 the Group executed a debt exchange programme, which sought to capitalise on the prevailing market conditions, and acquired 135m of its existing subordinated loan notes and 25m of new cash in exchange for the issue of 129.7m of new guaranteed 9% debt, which matures in 2016, generating a net gain of some 27.9m.
The earliest repayment date for the remaining 125m subordinated loan notes is 2016, but this can be extended at the option of the Group until 2026.
The Group has the option to defer interest payments on this debt, but if it elects to do so then no dividend can be paid to Ordinary Shareholders until the cumulative amount of any unpaid interest due on the subordinated debt is settled in full.
No such interest payments have been deferred.
F&C Asset Management Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 110 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 38.
Financial risk management continued The Group issued 35.0m of debt during 2008 to partially finance the REIT acquisition.
The 25m of cash raised as part of the debt exchange was used to repay a portion of this debt.
The remaining 10m of this debt requires to be repaid in full by 30 June 2010.
The Directors currently anticipate that this debt will be repaid from existing cash resources, but they will continue to monitor other options available to repay this debt, recognising that prevailing market conditions will impact any refinancing alternatives.
Details of the Groups interest bearing loans and borrowings are given in note 24.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of the Groups net assets, without prior Board approval, recognising the general principle of seeking to minimise capital loss.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD, prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
In 2006, the Group obtained from the FSA a waiver from meeting any minimum capital requirements under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
This waiver took effect from 1 January 2007 and requires renewal during 2011.
At 31 December 2009, there were 14 regulated companies in the Group, of which 10 are registered in the United Kingdom and are subject to regulation by the FSA.
This includes F&C MPF which, being a regulated insurance firm, as opposed to an investment firm, is not part of the consolidation Group for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
Overseas regulated companies, registered in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Hong Kong are subject to regulatory capital requirements set out by their local regulatory authority, as embedded within the legislation of those jurisdictions.
Regulations set out the measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resources Requirements CRR to determine the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
This CRR is referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD.
For the UK regulated investment firms, the CRR is the higher of: The sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement.
Credit risk represents the risk of a party being unable to meet its obligations to a firm, calculated using risk weighted percentages applied to the various exposure amounts.
The market risk for F&C represents the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates, calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firms relevant fixed annual expenditure in the previous years audited Financial Statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit financial returns monthly, quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The CRD requires the Group to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that companies have adequate capital to enable them to manage risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing on major risks, considering how the Group would cope with a significant market down turn, for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
All of the Groups regulated entities maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout 2009.
The extent of risks arising from financial instruments Note 38 presents details of the Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
This note provides numerical analyses of the Groups direct exposure to such financial risk, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at each reporting date.
The disclosures in this note exclude any policyholder unit-linked assets and liabilities in respect of F&C MPF, as the risks and rewards rest primarily with the policyholders.

The extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued v Sensitivity analysis The Group has quantified the impact of specific changes in its significant market risk variables.
This analysis measures the change in fair value and cash flows of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis, which is for illustrative purposes only, is prepared based on financial instruments at the reporting dates.
The sensitivity assumes changes in certain market conditions.
These assumptions may differ materially from the actual outturn due to the inherent uncertainties in global financial markets.
In practice, market risks rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
The methods and assumptions used are the same for both reporting periods.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on the impact a set percentage increase or decrease in the market conditions would have on the profit or loss and on total equity.
Changes in exchange rates assume an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10.0% for foreign currency to Sterling rates at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in fair values of investments assume a 10.0% increase or decrease in the fair values of investments at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Changes in market interest rates assume an increase or decrease of 1.0% in the rate applied to average cash balances in the year.
The financial impact of market risk sensitivities, after taxation, are summarised below: Profit or loss Profit or loss Equity Equity sensitivity sensitivity sensitivity sensitivity As at 31 December 2009 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling Euro exchange rates 2.2 2.7 8.8 10.8 Sterling USD exchange rates 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Fair value movement Investments 10% -10% 10% -10% Sterling equity prices 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 As at 31 December 2008 Exchange rate movement 10% 10% 10% 10% Currency Sterling Euro exchange rates 8.0 9.8 18.4 18.3 Sterling USD exchange rates 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Fair value movement Investments 10% 10% 10% 10% Sterling equity prices 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.6 Interest rate movement 1% 1% 1% 1% Sterling market interest rates 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 Represents a 10% movement in favour of the Group and 10% movement against the Group.
The decrease in the sensitivity to changes in the Sterling Euro exchange rate from 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2009 is primarily attributable to the lower value of open forward currency contracts held as at 31 December 2009.
In addition, the F&C REIT put options are disclosed at fair value.
A 10% movement in the fair value of the options at 31 December 2009 would result in a 6.0m 31 December 2008: 6.6m charge or credit to the Income Statement and to equity.
Impairment of financial assets can also be affected by changes in the relevant underlying risk.

Insurance risk management The Groups insurance contracts are all annuity contracts which guarantee payment during the lifetime of the annuitant at a specified level or with a specified escalation factor.
They are all 100% reinsured with Friends Provident Pensions Limited.
The only risk that the Group is subject to in respect of these contracts is the credit risk of the reinsurer.
Given the small amount at risk 1.9m at 31 December 2009: 2.1m at 31 December 2008, this is not considered significant.
