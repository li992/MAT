During the year the Company returned cash of 460m to shareholders and at the same time carried out a consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were conditional on each other.
They were specifically designed to achieve the same overall effect on the Companys capital structure as a buy back of shares in a way in which all shareholders could participate.
Accordingly, earnings per share is presented on the basis that in substance a share buy back has occurred.
The Directors are of the opinion that the publication of the headline earnings is useful to readers of interim statements and annual accounts as they give an indication of underlying business performance.

Goodwill is allocated to the Groups Cash Generating Units CGUs identified according to business segment and country of operation.
88 fide La Rue Annual Report 2009 Group Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 11 Intangible Assets continued A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2009 2008 m m Cash Processing Solutions Cash Systems in 2008 3.7 9.9 Security Paper and Print 4.3 4.8 8.0 14.7 Goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Cash Processing Solutions and Security Paper and Print on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs.
The estimates of recoverable amount are based on value-in-use calculations.
In each case, the value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections covering a five year period based on the 2009 2010 budget, plus a terminal value.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below: a Cash Processing Solutions: unit sales of large sorters and the extent of maintenance income generated from these sales, which are based on a combination of orders on hand and past experience.
b Security Paper and Print: the volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, which are also based on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: i expectations in respect of economic growth and central banks banknote circulation policies, and ii the Companys knowledge of its customer base, gained through its long standing relationships with them.
Material input prices and foreign exchange rates are also factors but are not considered significant in the context of the headroom available in the calculations.
The pre-tax discount rate used for both Cash Processing Solutions and Security Paper and Print was 14.1 per cent 2008 14.4 per cent.
The discount rates applied take into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC and the relative risks associated with the CGUs operations.
The post tax discount rate used is unchanged compared to the prior period reflecting the fact that the Groups WACC has not changed and that the risks associated with the CGUs in question have not been materially affected by the recent economic conditions.
Cash flows beyond the period covered by the projections have been extrapolated assuming a growth rate of 3 per cent, which approximates to the long term GDP growth in the markets served by the Group.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and management do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions that could result in the assets recoverable amounts falling below their book values.

90 fide La Rue Annual Report 2009 Group Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Financial Instruments Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Currency risk Market risk The Groups exposure to each of the above risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of capital are set out below.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
The committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group Treasury Department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Group Treasury Department provides written principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the result of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk and the value of the Groups revenue attributable to sales transactions with any one customer is not significant.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
91 fide La Rue Annual Report 2009 Group Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 15 Financial Instruments continued Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar, Euro and the UK pound.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months.
Forecast transactions must be highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors earnings per share, which the Group defines as the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
The Board also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Groups strong cash generative characteristics have given the Board scope to regularly return to shareholders surplus cash flow through a combination of progressive dividends, share buy backs and special dividends.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value m m m m Financial assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 77.9 77.9 110.8 110.8 Cash and cash equivalents 58.5 58.5 120.3 120.3 Derivative financial instruments: Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges 6.5 6.5 1.9 1.9 Forward exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges 3.0 3.0 6.2 6.2 Embedded derivatives 25.4 25.4 11.4 11.4 Total financial assets 171.3 171.3 250.6 250.6 Financial liabilities Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 88.3 88.3 5.1 5.1 Finance lease liabilities 3.3 3.6 8.5 9.7 Trade and other payables excluding accruals 105.3 105.3 173.3 173.3 Derivative financial instruments: Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges 18.4 18.4 0.8 0.8 Forward exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges 19.5 19.5 12.6 12.6 Embedded derivatives 4.0 4.0 4.4 4.4 Interest rate swaps 0.1 0.1 Net investment hedges 0.1 0.1 Total financial liabilities 238.9 239.2 204.8 206.0 Determination of fair values Trade and other receivables and payables The amortised cost less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables is assumed to approximate to fair value due to their short maturities.
Embedded derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and purchase contracts.
92 fide La Rue Annual Report 2009 Group Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Financial Instruments continued Forward exchange contracts used for hedging The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by using valuation techniques.
In estimating fair values, the Group makes assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on LIBOR in the relevant currencies and were as follows: 2009 2008 Leases 1.89% 5.70% Credit risk Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment is required for financial assets that are not past due and are not currently known to be impaired.

The principal amount outstanding under forward contracts with maturities greater than 12 months is Euro 80.5m.
These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 1 on forward foreign exchange contracts at 28 March 2009 will be released to the income statement at various dates between one month and 24 months from the balance sheet date.
Net investments Following the sale of the Cash Systems business excluding CPS, the Group has fide-designated all of its previous net investment hedges.
No net investment hedges were outstanding at 28 March 2009.
At 29 March 2008, the following net investment hedges were in place: The Group designated $30m of US Dollar swaps as a hedge of the net investments in the Groups US subsidiary operations.
The fair value of the currency swaps at 29 March 2008 was nil.
The Group designated v30m of Euro swaps as a hedge of the net investment in the Groups European subsidiary operations.
The fair value of the currency swaps at 29 March 2008 was 0.1m.
The Group designated Rand 40m of South African Rand swaps as a hedge of the net investment in the Groups South African subsidiary operations.
The Group designated Franc 5m of Swiss Franc swaps as a hedge of the net investment in the Groups Swiss subsidiary operations.
Cash management swaps The Group uses currency swaps to manage the level of borrowings in foreign currencies.
The fair value of cash management currency swaps at 28 March 2009 was 0.2m 2008: 0.7m.
Gains and losses on cash management swaps are included in the consolidated income statement.
The principal amounts outstanding under cash management currency swaps are US Dollars 8.4m, Euro 16.8m, Canadian Dollar 3.2m, Singapore Dollar 0.9m, Swiss Francs 1.7m, South African Rand 9.3m and Japanese Yen 14.5m.
Embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives relate to sales and purchase contracts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the customer supplier, or a currency that is not deemed to be a commonly used currency of the country in which the customer supplier is based.
The fair value of embedded derivatives at 28 March 2009 was 21.4m 2008: 7.0m.
Currency risk Exposure to currency risk The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: Some of the Groups net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to limit the translation exposure and resulting impact on equity by borrowing and or using forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the translation exposure in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
At 28 March 2009 there were no material currency exposures after accounting for the effect of the hedging transactions.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations.
However, where transaction exposures do occur the Groups policy is to hedge firm commitments as soon as they are entered into using forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as cashflow hedges if applicable.
In addition it is the Groups policy to hedge between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months.
For the year ended 28 March 2009 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 12.0m loss recognised in equity.

Most of the utilisation of these provisions is likely within the next year.
Business disposal provisions represent amounts reserved to cover exposures arising in connection with businesses previously owned by the Group.
These exposures include product warranties provided prior to disposal, disputed contractual amounts and certain indemnities provided by the Group to the new owners.
The majority of these provisions are expected to be utilised within one year.
Warranty provisions relate to present obligations for defective products and include known claims as well as anticipated claims that had not been reported at the balance sheet date.
The provisions are management judgements based on information currently available, past history and experience of the products sold, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that the actual liabilities may differ from the provisions.
The precise timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain, but is generally expected to fall within the year.
