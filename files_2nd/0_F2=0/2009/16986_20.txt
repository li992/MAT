63 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 2009 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 9 March 2010.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008 2008.
In addition, certain comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 2007 as detailed below.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
The results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except when otherwise indicated.
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been analysed between: i profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
a Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
b Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide increased visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
While updating the valuation of the Groups retirement benefit plans for the purposes of the Groups 2009 interim condensed financial statements, the qualified actuary who advises the Company identified an error in their model used to calculate the actuarial valuation of the Groups UK retirement benefit plans for the periods ended 28 December 2007 and 26 December 2008.
The impact of this was to understate the retirement benefit plan deficits on a cumulative basis by 8.1m at 28 December 2007 and 15.2m at 26 December 2008.
There was also a corresponding overstatement of net deferred tax liabilities of 2.3m and 4.3m at those respective period ends.
The impact on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was to increase actuarial losses on defined benefit plans by 7.1m and to decrease tax on items taken directly to equity by 2.0m in the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008.
There was no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement.
The net impact was to overstate Group net assets by 5.8m and 10.9m at 28 December 2007 and 26 December 2008 respectively.
All affected balances and amounts have been restated in these financial statements.
To this effect, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and affected notes present restated comparative information for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008.
In addition, as required by IAS1, the Consolidated Balance Sheet and affected notes also present restated comparative information for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except as described below.
IFRS7 Amendment Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Improving Disclosure about Financial Instruments: The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement in the form of a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management.
As permitted by the amended standard, comparative information for the disclosures required by the amendments has not been provided in this first year of implementation.
The amended disclosures are presented in note 30.
IFRS8 Operating Segments: In adopting IFRS8 the Group concluded that the operating segments were the same as the business segments determined under IAS14 Segment Reporting.
Details of these operating segments are disclosed in note 3, including the new disclosure requirements of IFRS8 and the related revised comparative information.
IAS1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements: The adoption of IAS1 revised has required the reconciliation of movements in equity, previously disclosed in note 25 to the Groups 2008 annual report, to be presented as a primary statement entitled, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
In addition the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income & Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In addition to some presentational changes this has resulted in a tax charge of 1.0m in relation to the cost of share-based payments for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008 being reclassified from the former Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income & Expense to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
IAS23 revised Borrowing Costs: In adopting IAS23 revised the Group has amended its accounting policy and, from 1 January 2009, now capitalises borrowing costs on qualifying assets.
The implementation of this policy has had no material impact on the Groups financial statements.
64 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued In addition to the above, the following standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements and have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS2 Amendment Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IAS32 Amendment Financial Instruments: Presentation: Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC14 IAS19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction Improvements to IFRS In May 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and to clarify wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the amendments did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Some of the key amendments and their impact are detailed below.
IFRS8 Operating Segments: clarifies that segment assets and liabilities need only be reported when those assets and liabilities are included in measures that are used by the chief operating decision maker.
On the basis that the chief operating decision maker reviews segment assets and liabilities the Group discloses this information in note 3.
IAS7 Statement of Cash Flows: explicitly states that only expenditure that results in recognising an asset can be classified as a cash flow from investing activities.
This amendment will impact the presentation in the cash flow statement of the contingent consideration upon cash settlement in relation to the acquisition of Weir SOS which was completed in 2008 note 13.
IAS36 Impairment of Assets: when discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value less costs to sell additional disclosure is required about the discount rate, consistent with disclosures required when the discounted cash flows are used to estimate value in use.
This amendment has no impact on the Group because the recoverable amount of its cash generating units is estimated using value in use.
The amendment also clarified that the largest unit permitted for allocating goodwill acquired in a business combination is the operating segment as defined in IFRS8 before aggregation for reporting purposes.
This amendment has no impact on the Group as the annual impairment test is performed before aggregation.
The Group has also adopted the following standards which have been issued with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
IAS27 Amendment Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: The adoption of this standard has resulted in the separate disclosure of each item of other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
In addition, minority interests are now referred to as non-controlling interests.
IFRS3 revised Business Combinations: IFRS3 revised is applied to business combinations arising from 27 December 2008.
This requires recognition of subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in the income statement rather than against goodwill.
In addition, transaction costs are required to be recognised immediately in the income statement.
As there have been no business combinations in the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 the adoption of this standard has had no impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Use of estimates & judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the Financial review on page 27.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Groups share of its joint ventures results.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Accounting policies continued Joint ventures The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These all take the form of agreements to share control over other entities jointly controlled entities.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Property, plant & equipment The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years 66 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Investment property The Group has one property which is currently being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services and as such this property is classified as investment property.
Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand names - indefinite life Customer relationships - 7 - 25 years Purchased software - 4 - 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years Other - up to 6 years Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Financial assets & liabilities The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade & other receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
68 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards.
The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company and the Group are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees throughout the world and other benefits, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to certain employees in the United States.
For defined benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
For defined contribution plans, the costs represent the Groups contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised: ii Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: iii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Accounting policies continued Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
New standards & interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
Effective date for International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS periods commencing Improvements to IFRS issued 16 April 2009 1 July 2009 IAS24 Related Party Disclosures Revised 1 January 2011 IAS32 Classification of Rights Issues Amendment to IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation 1 February 2010 IAS39 Eligible Hedged Items Amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 1 July 2009 IFRS2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS2 Share-based Payment 1 January 2010 IFRS9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2013 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC14 Amendment to IFRIC14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement 1 January 2011 IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 30 June 2009 IFRIC18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 1 July 2009 IFRIC19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 1 July 2010 not yet adopted for use in the European Union The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Segment information For management purposes the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial.
These three divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment in accordance with IFRS8.
The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Group Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment designs and manufactures pumps, hydrocyclones, valves and other complementary equipment for the mining, flue gas desulphurisation and oil sands markets.
The Oil & Gas segment manufactures pumps and ancillary equipment and provides aftermarket support for the global upstream and downstream oil and gas markets.
The Power & Industrial segment designs, manufactures and provides aftermarket support for rotating and flow control equipment to the global power generation and industrial sectors.
All other segments, which are disclosed as Group companies, include the results of Liquid Gas Equipment which supplies equipment to the liquefied petroleum gas marine and onshore markets.
In 2008, it also included the results of the Canadian distribution business and the Materials and Foundries businesses up to the dates of disposal on 29 August, 2 and 3 October 2008 respectively.
None of the businesses disposed of were of a sufficient size to meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS5.
The Group Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, including impairment segment result.
Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function.
The amounts provided to the Group Executive with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
70 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 3.
Segment information continued The segment information provided to the Group Executive for the reportable segments for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 and the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008 is disclosed below.
The results of Weir SPM are no longer included within acquisitions as Weir SPM was part of the Group for the whole of 2008.

Discontinued operations During the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 there were no disposals of businesses which were of a sufficient size to meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS5.
On 21 April 2008, the Group disposed of Weir Strachan & Henshaw for a net cash consideration of 63.7m resulting in a gain on disposal of 55.1m after a tax charge of 2.4m.
The net liabilities disposed of amounted to 1.9m and direct disposal costs and provisions amounted to 8.5m.
Foreign exchange gains suspended in equity on the retranslation of the overseas operations disposed of, amounting to 0.4m, were recycled to the income statement as part of the gain on sale in accordance with IAS21.
In 2009, following the expiry of certain warranty periods, an unutilised amount of 5.2m has been released to the income statement.

The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
In the main there has been an increase in the WACC relative to 2008 largely due to an increase in government bond yields partially offset by a reduction in lending margins that banks place on borrowing costs.
The WACC in relation to Weir Gabbioneta has decreased relative to 2008 as Italian government bond yields have remained broadly in line with 2008 while bank lending margins have reduced.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.2% to 4.0% reflects the increasingly global nature of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their home markets.
3 EBIT margins EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.
4 Weir SPM Weir SPM is a supplier of gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
A large proportion of the businesss revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon natural gas prices and gas storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast natural gas prices and gas storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2009.
5 Warman companies The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets outside Africa.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives continued 6 Weir Gabbioneta Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
7 Weir Warman Weir Warman is a supplier of pumps and associated equipment and services to the African mining industry.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure across Africa which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 12.0m 2008: 10.9m: 2007: 16.1m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments A deferred tax liability of 18.9m 2008: 8.6m: 2007: 9.1m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries.
As at 1 January 2010, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 762.1m 2008: 758.4m: 2007: 465.8m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.

The settlement gain of 0.7m relates to the wind up of the Canadian plan 2008: 2.5m curtailment loss was recognised in relation to the wind up of the Canadian plan and 0.1m curtailment gain was recognised in relation to post-retirement healthcare.
The 1.5m settlement gain in respect of UK pensions relates to an enhanced transfer exercise completed in 2009 for deferred members of the main UK plan.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group made contributions of 11.1m in 2009 2008: 6.5m: 2007: 6.5m in addition to the employers regular contributions, of which 1.8m related to the wind up of the Canadian plan.
The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2010 are expected to be 12.1m.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.

Commitments & legal claims continued Legal claims The company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
In 2004, an announcement was made to the London Stock Exchange in connection with the Groups involvement in the UN sanctioned Oil for Food Programme.
The Group continues to co-operate fully with the on-going investigations by UK authorities in this connection.
In addition, the Company is subject to a claim relating to an action for damages arising from the UN Oil for Food Programme which has been raised in the United States against just under 100 companies.
This action will be robustly defended.
To the extent not already provided for, the directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Equity settled share-based payments LTIP There are three types of award which may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares.
Details of each award are outlined in the Remuneration report on pages 40 to 46.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average share prices WASP of shares awarded under the LTIP.
2009 2008 Number 2009 Number 2008 Million WASP Million WASP Outstanding at the beginning of the period 1.9 6.41 1.9 4.75 Awarded during the period 1.6 4.00 0.8 7.47 Exercised during the period 0.4 4.46 0.7 7.86 Forfeited during the period 0.7 5.55 0.1 6.77 Outstanding at the end of the period 2.4 5.54 1.9 6.41 An amount of 2.4m 2008: 2.0m has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the number of awards which are expected to be made at the end of the vesting period.
This comprises an amount of 1.4m 2008: 1.4m in respect of parent company employees and 1.0m 2008: 0.6m in respect of employees of subsidiaries.
Subsidiary companies made a cash contribution to the parent company of 1.1m 2008: 0.9m in the period in respect of their LTIP awards.
The remaining contractual lives of the outstanding LTIP awards at the end of the period are as follows.

In 2009, the conditional share award was forfeited as the vesting conditions of the award were not satisfied.
As a result, a credit of 0.8m 2008: a charge of 0.8m has been recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the forfeited conditional share award.
The number of shares outstanding at 1 January 2010 is nil 2008: 405,953.
Equity settled share-based payments continued Share option scheme The Company operated a savings related share option scheme in the UK which was not subject to performance criteria.
This scheme was closed to new entrants in 2004 and the last date for exercising options under the scheme was 1 January 2009.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options.

Fair value of equity settled share-based payments The fair value of the conditional awards under the LTIP and the conditional share award have been estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The following table gives the assumptions made during the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 and the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008.
Conditional share award LTIP 2009 2008 2009 2008 Weighted average dividend yield % - 1.83 4.62 2.22 Weighted average expected volatility % - 29.00 30.00 29.00 Weighted average expected life years - 3.00 3.00 3.00 Weighted average risk free rate % - 4.25 1.90 4.02 Weighted average share price pence - 901p 400p 747p Weighted average fair value pence - 901p 244p 378p The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Market related performance conditions have been taken into account in the calculation of fair values.

Financial assets & liabilities Financial risk management objectives & policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk.
Details of these risks are set out in the Directors report.
In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy In respect of transactional foreign exchange risk the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Group treasury function.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified also apply hedge accounting.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash flow hedge.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar US$ net assets exposure.
This is achieved through designating an element of US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups US dollar investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and fixed rate notes.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20. Credit risk policy The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits and by only trading with counterparties that have a strong credit standing based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy The Groups borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term.
Interest rate swaps are utilised that have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
At 1 January 2010, 18% 2008: 47% of the Groups debt was at fixed rates of interest through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
On 11 January 2010, the Group issued the equivalent of US$250.0m of five year US$110.0m and eight year US$140.0m fixed rate notes.
This will increase the proportion of fixed rate borrowings from the level as at 1 January 2010.
Financial assets & liabilities continued Net investment in foreign operations As at 1 January 2010, US dollar variable rate loans included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, amounting to US$175.0m 2008: US$190.0m, cross currency swaps of US$324.0m 2008: US$404.0m and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$90.0m 2008: assets of US$6.0m have been designated as a hedge of the Groups exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM and Weir Warman.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries.
Carrying amounts & fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value 2009 2009 2008 2008 m m m m Financial assets Derivative financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss 4.7 4.7 47.1 47.1 Derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 2.8 2.8 8.5 8.5 Trade & other receivables excluding statutory assets & prepayments 224.7 224.7 289.5 289.5 Cash & short-term deposits 57.0 57.0 74.1 74.1 289.2 289.2 419.2 419.2 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss 4.4 4.4 62.9 62.9 Derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 43.4 44.2 97.8 97.8 Amortised cost Bank overdrafts & short-term borrowings 1.3 1.3 20.5 20.5 Trade & other payables excluding statutory liabilities & deferred income 252.9 252.9 290.3 290.3 Obligations under finance leases 0.9 0.9 1.3 1.3 Floating rate borrowings 173.1 173.1 292.1 292.1 Fixed rate borrowings 0.9 0.9 0.1 0.1 476.9 477.7 765.0 765.0 The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The derivative financial instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates and interest rate curves.
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements in the form of a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 1 January 2010, the Group held all financial instruments at level 2 fair value measurement.
During the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Effect of hedging & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments.
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
Within the Group, two subsidiaries apply cash flow hedge accounting to these transactions.
Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the period.
In addition, as noted above, the Group utilises interest rate swaps to convert borrowings from floating to fixed rates of interest.

Financial assets & liabilities continued Foreign exchange risk The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risks relate to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and United States dollar.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of each respective financial asset or liability at the year end for a 25% strengthening of sterling against the relevant exchange rates.
