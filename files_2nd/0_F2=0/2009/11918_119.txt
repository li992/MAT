Prior to 1 January 1998 all goodwill was written off to reserves on the date of acquisition.
3,127m of the carrying value relates to acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 and 1,219m relates to acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 the date of transition to IFRS.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other than goodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a significant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be significantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets, which are amortised, with only the remaining difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired being allocated to goodwill.
Other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology and software rights.
Amortisation of 5m 2008: 5m is included in the income statement in cost of goods sold and 142m 2008: 111m in administrative and other expenses.
Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill Impairment tests have been carried out where appropriate as described below.
The recoverable amount for each unit tested exceeds its carrying value.
Goodwill is allocated to 14 cash-generating units CGUs within the business segments as follows: All figures in millions 2009 2008 US School Curriculum 812 937 US School Assessment and Information 652 722 US Higher Education 1,064 1,164 Canada 181 173 International Education Publishing 468 315 International Education Assessment and Testing 222 241 Professional Publishing 13 15 Professional Assessment and Testing 226 254 Pearson Education total 3,638 3,821 Financial Times 43 46 Mergermarket 125 130 Interactive Data 184 208 FT Group total 352 384 Penguin US 190 216 Penguin UK 103 95 Pearson Australia 63 54 Penguin total 356 365 Total goodwill 4,346 4,570 As highlighted in the 2008 business review, integration of the US School and Higher Education businesses began in 2008.
This integration continued throughout 2009 and has now advanced to a point where, from 1 January 2010, these companies will be combined into one CGU for impairment review purposes.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 10.9% to 11.8% for the Pearson Education businesses 2008: 10.2% to 11.7%, 12.7% to 18.1% for the FT Group businesses 2008: 10.8% to 20.5% and 9.5% to 11.4% for the Penguin businesses 2008: 8.8% to 10.4%.
Perpetuity growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period are based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and reflect the long-term growth prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% was used for all CGUs in 2009 2008: 2.0%.
The perpetuity growth rates are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
