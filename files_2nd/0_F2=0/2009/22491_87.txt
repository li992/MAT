Contingent liabilities and commitments Contingent liabilities Financial Services Compensation Scheme A principal subsidiary of the group, Close Brothers Limited, by virtue of being a Financial Services Authority regulated deposit taker, contributes to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS which provides compensation to customers of financial institutions in the event that an institution is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
In order to meet its obligations to the depositors of a number of institutions which failed in 2008 and 2009 the FSCS has borrowed amounts from HM Treasury on an interest only basis to September 2011.
It is anticipated that these borrowings will be repaid wholly or substantially from the realisation of the assets of the failed institutions.
However, if the assets of these institutions are insufficient, the FSCS will recoup any shortfalls in the form of additional levies based on the level of market participation of individual institutions.
At the date of this Annual Report it is not possible to estimate with any certainty the amount or timing of any such additional levies.
The FSCS raises annual levies from the banking industry to meets its management expenses and compensation costs and individual institutions make payments based on their level of market participation.
The group has accrued 1.3 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS including the interest on the loan from HM Treasury in respect of the levy years to 31 March 2010.
Other The group has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees arising in the normal course of business amounting to 10.0 million 2008: 11.5 million.
