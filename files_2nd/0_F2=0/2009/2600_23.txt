No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the parent company ultimately controls the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, as such, is able to control the timing of the reversal of any associated temporary differences.
The Company has determined that either the overseas profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries, it is not expected that such distributions will give rise to a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of 10.6m 2008: 26.4m.
The unutilised tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 96.1m 2008: 95.0m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be set.
