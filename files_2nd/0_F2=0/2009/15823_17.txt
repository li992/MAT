Restructuring costs Restructuring costs recognised during 2009 principally arose in relation to the restructuring of the Groups manufacturing operations under projects Eagle and Cheetah.
In particular: in Industrial & Automotive, the cessation of Power Transmissions manufacturing operations in Aachen, Germany, and the closures of its powder metal facility at Mississauga, Ontario, scheduled for 2010, its pulley and tensioner facility at London, Ontario, and FormFlo in the UK: the cessation of Fluid Powers hose manufacturing activities in Erembodegem, Belgium and the substantial closure of its assembly facility at St. Neots, UK: and, in Other Industrial & Automotive, the closure of Ideals manufacturing facility at St. Augustine, Florida and the rationalisation of Dexters manufacturing facilities: and in Building Products, the closure of the Philips Doors and Windows business.
In 2008, restructuring costs principally related to the closure of Power Transmissions facility at Moncks Corner, South Carolina, further rationalisation of the Lasco Bathware business in the US and the closure of Hart & Cooleys production facility at Tucson, Arizona, and further costs associated with outsourcing of information technology services that began in 2007.
In 2007, restructuring costs principally related to the rationalisation of production facilities within the Lasco Bathware and Philips Doors and Windows businesses in the US, the outsourcing of information technology services, and the initiatives within the Fluid Power and Air Distribution segments that began in 2006.

Gain on amendment of post-employment benefits With effect from 30 September 2009, the Group closed its principal defined benefit pension plans in the US and Canada to future service accrual and the deferred pension benefits accrued under those plans were frozen, based on the pensionable salaries of participating employees at that date.
In addition, the Group closed the Gates post-retirement healthcare plan in the US to employees who had not retired by 31 December 2009 and reduced the benefits payable to existing beneficiaries.
As a result of these amendments, the Group recognised a gain of $63.0 million in 2009, of which $35.3 million related to pensions and $27.7 million to healthcare benefits.

Also in 2009, the provision for uncertain tax positions increased by $15.8 million, principally due to an extension of the period available to the tax authorities of certain jurisdictions in which to assess tax payable in prior years.
Financial Statements 89 Group Financial Statements Permanent differences arising in 2008 principally comprised a tax benefit of $115.8 million on currency translation losses that were not recognised in the accounts but were deductible for tax purposes, less the tax effect of $69.4 million on expenses that were recognised in the accounts but were not deductible for tax purposes in particular, the tax effect of $45.4 million attributable to the impairment of goodwill.
In 2007, a deferred tax asset was not recognised in respect of losses amounting to $160.7 million that related to investments in subsidiaries that were held for sale because there were insufficient available capital gains against which the losses could be utilised.

Loss earnings per share Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of the Companys ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of the Companys ordinary shares in issue during the period excludes 3,962,756 shares 2008: 4,002,675 shares: 2007: 4,331,018 shares, being the weighted average number of own shares held during the period.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.

Impairment tests Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications that it may have suffered an impairment.
Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell of the CGU or group of CGUs to which it is allocated.
In all impairment tests of goodwill performed during the periods under review, the recoverable amount was determined based on value in use calculations.
Management based the value in use calculations on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three-year financial plans approved by the Board, in which the principal assumptions were those regarding sales growth rates, selling prices and changes in direct costs.
Cash flows for the years beyond the three-year financial plans for the CGUs to which individually significant amounts of goodwill were allocated were calculated as follows: cash flows in the fourth and fifth years were estimated by management based on relevant industry and economic forecasts: thereafter, the cash flows were projected to grow at 2% per annum, which does not exceed expected long-term growth rates in their principal end markets in North America, Europe, India and the Middle East.
Management applied discount rates to the resulting cash flow projections that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU or group of CGUs.
In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model.
Pre-tax discount rates used in the annual impairment tests of goodwill during 2009 were in the following ranges: Industrial & Automotive businesses 8.1% to 12.2% 2008: 9.0% to 12.9% : and Building Products businesses 10.4% to 17.2% 2008: 11.2% to 13.0%.
Financial Statements 97 Group Financial Statements D. Impairments recognised 2009 In February 2008, the Group acquired a 60% interest in Rolastar, a duct manufacturer based in India, and agreed terms for the subsequent acquisition of the remaining 40% minority interest, which was completed in July 2009.
Since the acquisition was negotiated, Rolastars end markets have deteriorated and this has caused the impairment of the entire goodwill allocated to the business, which amounted to $8.7 million.
Management used a pre-tax discount rate of 17.2%.
2008 During 2008, impairments totalling $228.6 million were recognised in relation to the goodwill allocated to Stackpole, Gates Mectrol and Selkirk.
Stackpole manufactures power transmission components, systems and assemblies, principally for automotive OEMs, at its facilities in Canada, Germany and South Korea.
Stackpoles end markets deteriorated significantly during 2008 and this caused the impairment of the entire goodwill allocated to the business, which amounted to $157.2 million.
Management used a pre-tax discount rate of 11.7%.
Gates Mectrol manufactures power transmission and motion control belts, principally for industrial and automotive OEMs, at its facilities in the US and Germany.
Gates Mectrols end markets deteriorated during the second half of 2008 and this caused the impairment of the entire goodwill allocated to the business, which amounted to $37.4 million.
Selkirk manufactures chimney, venting and air distribution products, principally for the residential construction market in North America.
Selkirks end markets deteriorated during 2008 and an impairment of $34.0 million was recognised in relation to the goodwill allocated to the business.
Management used a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5%.
Impairments are analysed by operating segment in note 5.
E. Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Individually significant CGUs Management does not consider that the recoverable amounts of the other CGUs or groups of CGUs to which significant amounts of goodwill are allocated may fall below their carrying amounts due to reasonably possible changes during the next year in one or more of the key assumptions.
At the end of 2008, the recoverable amount of Selkirk equalled its carrying amount and that of Hart & Cooley exceeded its carrying amount by only $38 million.
Management considered that either could have become impaired following a reasonably possible change in the principal assumptions.
Since then, the operations of Selkirk have merged with those of Hart & Cooley to form the Hart & Cooley Group.
At the end of 2009, the recoverable amount of the Hart & Cooley Group exceeded its carrying amount by $234 million.
During 2009, the recoverable amount of the Hart & Cooley Group increased significantly due to the recognition of merger synergies and the benefits of restructuring and lean manufacturing initiatives that could not be taken into account in measuring the recoverable amount at the end of 2008.
Other CGUs Management does not consider that a reasonably possible change in one or more key assumptions during the next year could cause the aggregate recoverable amount of other CGUs to fall below their aggregate carrying amount.

In 2009, the Group recognised an impairment of $10.2 million in relation to acquired customer relationships, of which the majority related to Rolastar and arose due to the deterioration in its end markets since its acquisition was negotiated in early 2008.
Management measured the impairment based on the value in use of the customer relationships, using a pre-tax discount rate of 17.2%.
Also in 2009, an impairment of $11.8 million was recognised in relation to software licences that had become surplus to requirements as a consequence of the Groups restructuring initiatives.

During 2008, against the background of the weakness of the Groups end markets, particularly the automotive OE markets in North America and Europe and the residential construction market in North America, management reviewed the recoverability of the assets of the Groups businesses that were exposed to those markets.
As a result of that review, the following impairments, totalling $113.8 million, were recognised in relation to property, plant and equipment: $65.9 million on the assets of Stackpole, based on value in use determined using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.7% : $16.8 million on the assets of Gates manufacturing facility at London, Ontario, based on fair value less costs to sell: $11.0 million on the assets of Philips Products Inc. based on fair value less costs to sell: and $20.1 million, principally on the assets of businesses in Europe none of these impairments was individually significant.

Bank loans Bank loans include amounts drawn down under the Groups 400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility.
At 2 January 2010, there were no drawings under this facility 3 January 2009: $129.3 million.
Borrowings under the facility attract interest at floating rates determined by reference to LIBOR and the facility expires on 8 August 2010.
During 2009, the Group negotiated a $450 million forward-start facility that commences on expiry of the existing facility and will itself expire in May 2012.
Other loans The Group has issued two bonds under the EMTN Programme: 150 million repayable at par on 20 December 2011 that bears interest at a fixed rate of 8%: and 250 million repayable at par on 16 September 2015 that bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.125%.
Unsecured loan notes The unsecured loan notes must be repaid, at par, on 30 June 2012.
Until that time, in certain circumstances, the noteholders have the right to require full or part repayment, at par, half-yearly on 30 June and 31 December and for this reason they are classified as current liabilities.

Summary Derivative financial instruments are held in relation to the Groups financial risk management policy which is described in note 33.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes.
The carrying amount of derivative financial instruments held by the Group was as follows: As at 2 January 2010 As at 3 January 2009 Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Hedging activities Translational hedges: Currency swaps 0.6 3.6 3.0 10.7 30.4 19.7 Interest rate swaps 56.3 56.3 62.7 2.1 60.6 56.9 3.6 53.3 73.4 32.5 40.9 Transactional hedges: Currency forwards 1.2 1.9 0.7 1.1 13.6 12.5 Commodity contracts 0.7 0.7 1.2 2.6 1.4 1.1 13.6 12.5 58.1 6.2 51.9 74.5 46.1 28.4 Classified as: Current 1.2 2.3 1.1 1.1 15.7 14.6 Non-current 56.9 3.9 53.0 73.4 30.4 43.0 58.1 6.2 51.9 74.5 46.1 28.4 Financial Statements 107 Group Financial Statements B.
Currency derivatives As at 2 January 2010, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of the Groups net assets was $796.6 million 3 January 2009: $888.7 million.
Where necessary, the Group has designated these contracts as net investment hedges.
During 2009, the net fair value loss of $3.1 million 2008: net gain of $57.2 million: 2007: net loss of $31.0 million in relation to designated net investment hedges was recognised in other comprehensive income.
Prior to the change in its presentation currency at the beginning of 2008, the Group also designated as net investment hedges the US dollar borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and, before their redemption in July 2007, the Companys US dollar denominated preference shares.
During 2007, the net currency translation gain of $3.8 million arising on these instruments was recognised in other comprehensive income.
The currency profile of the Groups net assets after taking into account translation hedges is presented in note 33.
Also during 2009, a net fair value gain of $12.2 million 2008: net loss of $9.4 million: 2007: net loss of $4.0 million was recognised within operating profit in respect of currency derivatives that were held to provide an economic hedge of transactional currency exposures but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
C. Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings under the Groups EMTN Programme from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
As at 2 January 2010, the nominal value of the contracts outstanding was 400 million 3 January 2009: 400 million.
The Group has designated these contracts as fair value hedges in relation to the borrowings.
During 2009, the Group recognised a net fair value loss of $13.3 million 2008: net gain of $75.7 million: 2007: net gain of $7.0 million in relation to these contracts and the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings was decreased by $12.3 million 2008: increased by $75.6 million: 2007: increased by $5.4 million to reflect the change in the fair value of the borrowings attributable to the hedged risk and the amortisation of the transitional adjustment that was recognised on adoption of IAS 39.
During 2009, a net loss of $1.0 million 2008: net gain of $0.1 million: 2007: net gain of $1.6 million was, therefore, recognised within other finance expense in relation to these hedges.
Until December 2009, when the remaining contracts matured, interest rate swaps were held to restrict the amount of floating rate US dollar debt.
During 2009, a net fair value gain of $2.3 million 2008: net loss of $2.1 million: 2007: net loss of $3.8 million was recognised within other finance expense in relation to these contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The profile of interest rate swaps held by the Group was as follows: Interest rate Payable Receivable Notional principal amount Variable million Variable Fixed Variable Fixed rate index As at 2 January 2010 Maturity date: December 2011 150.0 3.4% 8.0% 6 month LIBOR September 2015 250.0 1.7% 6.1% 3 month LIBOR As at 3 January 2009 Maturity date: December 2011 150.0 5.7% 8.0% 6 month LIBOR September 2015 250.0 4.0% 6.1% 3 month LIBOR December 2009 $65.0 4.6% 1.5% 3 month LIBOR D. Currency translation loss on hedging instruments Certain of the translational hedging instruments held by the Group are denominated in sterling but the Group is unable to apply hedge accounting to the gains and losses that arise on the translation of the carrying amount of those instruments into US dollars.
During 2009, a net currency translation loss of $1.6 million 2008: net loss of $17.9 million: 2007: net loss of $3.0 million was recognised within other finance expense in relation to those instruments.

Risk management policies The Groups central treasury function is responsible for procuring the Groups capital resources and maintaining an efficient capital structure, together with managing the Groups liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
All treasury operations are conducted within strict policies and guidelines that are approved by the Board.
Compliance with those policies and guidelines is monitored by the regular reporting of treasury activities to the Board.
A key element of the Groups treasury philosophy is that funding, interest rate and currency decisions and the location of cash and debt balances are determined independently from each other.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by raising funds in the most favourable markets.
Management aims to retain net debt in proportion to the currencies in which the net assets of the Groups operations are denominated.
The desired currency profile of net debt is achieved by entering into currency derivative contracts.
The proportion of investments in foreign operations effectively funded by shareholders equity is not hedged.
While the net income of foreign operations is not hedged, the effect of currency fluctuations on the Groups reported net income is partly offset by interest payable on net debt denominated in foreign currencies.
From time to time, the Group also enters into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures.
Where necessary, the desired interest rate profile of net debt in each currency is achieved by entering into interest rate derivative contracts.
The Groups portfolio of cash and cash equivalents is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution.
Management monitors closely the credit quality of the institutions with which it holds deposits.
Similar considerations are given to the Groups portfolio of derivative financial instruments.
The Groups borrowing facilities are monitored against forecast requirements and timely action is taken to put in place, renew or replace credit lines.
Managements policy is to reduce liquidity risk by diversifying the Groups funding sources and by staggering the maturity of its borrowings.
The Group has established long-term credit ratings of Baa3 Stable with Moodys and BBB Stable with Standard & Poors and shortterm credit ratings of P-3 with Moodys and A-2 with Standard & Poors.
Management aims to achieve an appropriate mix of debt and equity to ensure an efficient capital structure and to preserve these ratings.
Disclosures about the Groups capital are set out in note 40.
Financial assets and liabilities The following table analyses financial assets and liabilities by the categories defined in IAS 39.
Financial instruments held at fair value, have been categorised into one of three levels to reflect the degree to which observable inputs are used in determining the fair values: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived without adjustment from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
During 2009, there were no transfers of financial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2.

Cash and cash equivalents and current bank and other loans largely attract floating interest rates.
Accordingly, their carrying amounts are considered to approximate to fair value.
Non-current bank and other loans principally comprise any borrowings under the Groups multi-currency revolving credit facility that attract floating interest rates, the carrying amount of which is considered to approximate to fair value, and the listed bonds issued under the EMTN Programme, the fair value of which is based on their quoted market prices.
Finance lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed by reference to prevailing market interest rates.
Derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives held by the Group at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency derivatives are valued by reference to prevailing forward exchange rates.
Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the related cash flows using prevailing market interest rates.
Financial Statements 111 Group Financial Statements C. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Management considers the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows: As at As at 2 January 3 January 2010 2009 $ million $ million Trade and other receivables: Derivative assets 58.1 74.5 Non-derivative assets 722.1 757.7 780.2 832.2 Cash and cash equivalents 445.0 291.9 1,225.2 1,124.1 As at 2 January 2010, 94% 3 January 2009: 92% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents were held with institutions rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poors and P-1 by Moodys.
Credit risk disclosures with respect to trade receivables are set out in note 25.
D. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
As at 2 January 2010, the Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of $645.0 million 3 January 2009: $455.1 million available under the multi-currency revolving credit facility that expires on 8 August 2010.
Borrowings under this facility are at prevailing LIBOR rates, plus an agreed margin, dependent on the period of drawdown.
During 2009, the Group entered into a $450 million forward-start facility that will commence on expiry of the existing facility and will itself expire in May 2012.
In addition, the Group had uncommitted borrowing facilities of $381.2 million 3 January 2009: $495.4 million, of which $6.0 million 3 January 2009: $34.7 million had been drawn down for cash.
Consequently, the Groups committed borrowing headroom was $639.0 million 3 January 2009: $420.4 million in addition to cash and cash equivalents of $445.0 million 3 January 2009: $291.9 million.
The Group also had outstanding performance bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees amounting to $80.3 million 3 January 2009: $164.5 million.
The Group is subject to covenants, representations and warranties commonly associated with investment grade borrowings in respect of its committed borrowing facilities and bonds issued under the EMTN Programme.
The Group is subject to two financial covenants in respect of its committed borrowing facilities that are calculated by applying UK GAAP extant as at 31 December 2002.
The ratio of net debt to consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation must not exceed 2.5 times at the end of 2009, the ratio was 0.6 times.
The ratio of consolidated operating profit to the consolidated net interest charge must not be less than 3.0 times for 2009, the ratio was 5.5 times.
The Group complied with the borrowing covenants throughout each of the periods presented in the financial statements.
Any future non-compliance with the borrowing covenants could, if not waived, constitute an event of default and may, in certain circumstances, lead to an acceleration of the maturity of borrowings drawn down and the inability to access committed facilities.

Financial risk management continued E. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of, or future cash flows associated with, a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, after taking into account the effect of the Groups interest rate hedging activities, was as follows: As at 2 January 2010 As at 3 January 2009 Interest-bearing Interest-bearing Floating Fixed Non-interest Floating Fixed Non-interest rate rate bearing Total rate rate bearing Total $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Financial assets Trade and other receivables 16.0 764.2 780.2 3.8 828.4 832.2 Available-for-sale investments 1.2 1.2 0.8 0.8 Cash and cash equivalents see note 27 378.9 66.1 445.0 252.0 39.9 291.9 394.9 831.5 1,226.4 255.8 869.1 1,124.9 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 512.4 512.4 498.5 498.5 Borrowings see note 29 701.3 0.3 1.7 703.3 739.4 65.3 1.4 806.1 Obligations under finance leases 4.6 4.6 6.9 6.9 701.3 4.9 514.1 1,220.3 739.4 72.2 499.9 1,311.5 306.4 4.9 317.4 6.1 483.6 72.2 369.2 186.6 On the assumption that the change in interest rates is applied to the risk exposures in existence at the balance sheet date and that designated fair value hedges are 100% effective, an increase decrease of 100 basis points in the interest rates applying to financial assets and liabilities would increase decrease the Groups profit before tax by $2.7 million 3 January 2009: $4.0 million.
No amounts would be taken directly to equity.
F. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Currency risk arises on financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity by which they are held.

Background The Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees.
The plans are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country and include defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.
The Group provides defined contribution pension benefits in most of the countries in which it operates: in particular, the majority of the Groups employees in the US are entitled to such benefits.
Contributions payable by the Group to these plans amounted to $33.4 million 2008: $37.9 million: 2007: $47.6 million.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had not paid over to the plans contributions due amounting to $14.8 million 3 January 2009: $15.1 million.
All amounts due for the period were paid over subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in several countries: in particular, in the US and the UK.
Generally, the pension benefits provided under these plans are based upon pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds that are under the control of trustees.
All of the defined benefit pension plans operated by the Group are closed to new entrants.
In addition to the funded defined benefit pension plans, the Group has unfunded defined benefit obligations to certain current and former employees.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, principally health and life insurance cover, to certain of its employees in North America.
These plans, which are unfunded, are defined benefit plans.
As discussed in note 7, during 2009, the Group recognised a gain of $63.0 million on the amendment of pension and postretirement healthcare plans in North America.

Post-employment benefit obligations continued C. Pensions continued Plan assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the degree of global capital market integration.
The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward-looking views of the financial markets as revealed through the yield on longterm bonds and the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices.
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgment based on their knowledge of the Groups plans.
The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected long-term risk premiums for each asset class are developed.
The nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected inflation and real risk-free rate assumptions.
As a final consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop longterm equilibrium expectations.
The Groups investment strategy for pension plan assets includes diversification to minimise interest and market risks.
Accordingly, the interest rate risk inherent in the benefit obligation of the Groups US funded pension plans is hedged using a combination of bonds and interest rate swaps with a combined average duration of 10.1 years.
In general, the investment strategy for the Groups pension plans outside the US does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments.
Plan assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain target asset allocations.
Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to the timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity to make immediate and medium-term benefit payments is ensured.
The weighted averages of the expected returns on plan assets were as follows: As at 2 January 2010 As at 3 January 2009 As at 29 December 2007 Other Other Other UK US countries UK US countries UK US countries Equity instruments 7.80% 8.70% 8.80% 8.00% 9.51% 9.13% 7.95% 9.31% 9.39% Debt instruments 4.92% 5.20% 5.31% 4.83% 6.40% 4.87% 5.65% 6.30% 5.11% Other assets 4.20% 3.30% 2.00% 4.30% 3.90% 1.00% 4.85% 4.80% 1.00% The actual return on plan assets was as follows: Year ended Year ended Year ended 2 January 3 January 29 December 2010 2009 2007 Number Number Number UK 9.4% 4.5 % 6.0% US 0.8% 7.1 % 8.3% Other countries 7.1% 8.6 % 3.1% Actuarial gains and losses recognised in relation to defined benefit pension plans were as follows: Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 2 January 3 January 29 December 30 December 31 December 2010 2009 2007 2006 2005 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million At the end of the period: Present value of benefit obligation 1,116.0 1,018.1 1,196.5 1,270.0 1,216.9 Fair value of plan assets 924.5 862.1 1,125.0 1,041.8 904.9 Deficit in the plans 191.5 156.0 71.5 228.2 312.0 Recognised in the period: Net actuarial loss gain on plan assets 18.4 145.5 3.0 15.1 25.9 Net actuarial loss gain on benefit obligation 101.4 23.1 92.9 25.6 104.7 119.8 122.4 89.9 40.7 78.8 As at 2 January 2010, the cumulative net actuarial loss recognised in other comprehensive income amounted to $213.8 million 3 January 2009: loss of $94.0 million.

Background The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Groups senior executives and other eligible employees.
Although the Companys ordinary shares are denominated in US dollars, they are quoted in sterling on the London Stock Exchange.
Share options Options are granted from time to time under the Companys Sharesave Scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the UK.
It offers eligible employees the option to buy ordinary shares in Tomkins plc after a period of three, five or seven years, funded from the proceeds of a savings contract to which employees may contribute up to 250 per month.
Vested options are still outstanding under the Companys executive share option schemes which lapsed for the purpose of new awards in 2005.
The final unvested options under these schemes vested during 2007.
In 2009, the compensation expense recognised in respect of share options was $1.0 million 2008: $0.8 million: 2007: $3.1 million.
Changes in the total number of share options outstanding during the period were as follows: Restated Year ended 2 January 2010 Year ended 3 January 2009 Weighted Weighted average average Options exercise price Options exercise price Number Pence Number Pence Outstanding at the beginning of the period 18,131,583 238.60 19,602,926 242.71 Granted during the period 2,228,492 96.00 803,274 140.20 Cancelled during the period 634,716 157.70 391,195 206.68 Forfeited during the period 34,770 202.88 98,587 198.79 Exercised during the period 45,000 170.50 45,000 170.50 Lapsed during the period 2,397,288 232.61 1,739,835 250.65 Outstanding at the end of the period 17,248,301 224.24 18,131,583 238.60 Exercisable at the end of the period 14,544,405 245.19 16,341,128 244.64 See note 2 On the date on which options were exercised during 2009, the market price of the Companys ordinary shares was 178.90p per share 2008: 184.00p per share.
The fair value of options granted under the Sharesave Scheme was measured at their respective grant dates using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula based on the following assumptions: Year ended Year ended Year ended 2 January 3 January 29 December 2010 2009 2007 Weighted average fair value 68.34p 37.99p 73.81p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 161.75p 176.75p 264.25p Exercise price 96.00p 140.20p 211.40p Expected volatility 33.44% 24.59% 25.40% Expected life 4.47 years 4.57 years 4.66 years Risk-free interest rate 3.76% 4.55% 5.23% Expected dividends 6.25p 13.89p 13.89p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the options.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Other awards The Groups principal ongoing share-based compensation arrangements are the ABIP and the PSP.
Both are restricted to the Groups senior executives.
In 2009, the IBP was introduced as a temporary, one-year substitute for the ABIP.
The ABIP provides awards of Restricted Award Shares and Deferred Award Shares based on the bonusable profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.
Restricted Award Shares normally vest after a period of three years.
Dividends are paid on the Restricted Award Shares.
Deferred Award Shares normally vest after a period of three years, conditional on the participants continued employment with the Group.
Dividends are not paid on the Deferred Award Shares until they have vested.
During 2009, awards were granted over 999,108 ordinary shares 2008: 1,789,628 ordinary shares: 2007: 1,727,352 ordinary shares under the ABIP in relation to bonuses earned in 2008.
The IBP differs from the ABIP only in that awards made under the plan are based on the trading cash flow of the business for which the participants have responsibility and on the attainment of strategic achievement milestones that are set for each of the participants.
Awards over shares under the IBP are expected to be made in March 2010.
In 2009, an accrual of $2.0 million was recognised in respect of the Restricted Award Shares to be awarded under the IBP.
The PSP provides awards of shares which vest after a period of three years, conditional on the Groups total shareholder return relative to its cost of equity over the vesting period and the participants continued employment with the Group.
During 2009, awards were granted over 6,864,193 ordinary shares under the PSP 2008: 7,115,194 ordinary shares: 2007: 5,852,671 ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards made under the ABIP is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made under these schemes during the period was 130.46p 2008: 125.66p: 2007: 211.93p.
The fair value of awards made under the PSP was measured at their respective grant dates using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on the following assumptions: Year ended Year ended Year ended 2 January 3 January 29 December 2010 2009 2007 Weighted average fair value 41.92p 43.92p 66.45p Weighted average assumptions: Expected volatility 45.36% 36.41% 27.67% Expected life 3.00 years 3.00 years 3.00 years Risk-free interest rate 2.00% 4.71% 4.88% Dividend yield 4.87% 8.84% 5.00% Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the awards.
In 2009, the compensation expense recognised in respect of other awards was $10.3 million 2008: $11.2 million: 2007: $13.2 million.

Ordinary shares On 22 May 2008, the Companys ordinary shares were redenominated from sterling to US dollars.
The redenomination did not affect the rights of the holders of ordinary shares.
Ordinary shareholders have no entitlement to share in the profits of the Company, except for dividends that have been declared and in the event of the liquidation of the Company.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to attend, and vote at, general meetings of the Company or to appoint a proxy to attend and vote at such meetings on their behalf.
Ordinary shareholders have one vote for every share held.
Ordinary share capital represents the nominal value of ordinary shares issued.
C. Deferred shares When the Company redenominated its ordinary shares from sterling to US dollars, it was required by law to have a minimum share capital of 50,000 denominated in sterling.
The deferred shares were issued to meet this requirement, which was removed on the implementation of section 542 of the Companies Act 2006 on 1 October 2009.
Accordingly, the Company bought back and cancelled the deferred shares on 16 December 2009 and transferred the nominal amount of the shares to the capital redemption reserve in accordance with the applicable capital maintenance rules.
The deferred shares were not listed on any investment exchange and had extremely limited rights such that they effectively had no value.
D. Share premium account The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received.
The share premium account is not distributable but may be used for certain purposes specified by UK law, including to write off expenses on any issue of shares or debentures and to pay up fully paid bonus shares.
The share premium account may be reduced by special resolution of the Companys shareholders and with the approval of the court.
E. Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve records the cost of shares purchased by the Company for cancellation or redeemed in excess of the proceeds of any fresh issue of shares made specifically to fund the purchase or redemption.
The capital redemption reserve is not distributable but may be reduced by special resolution of the Companys shareholders and with the approval of the court.
