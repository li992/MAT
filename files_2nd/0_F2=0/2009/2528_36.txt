Earnings per share The weighted average number of shares for the year was: 2009 2008 2007 Millions of Millions of Millions of shares shares shares Ordinary shares 1,753 1,753 1,759 ESOP trust ordinary shares 13 5 4 Basic shares 1,740 1,748 1,755 Dilutive ordinary shares from share options 13 12 Diluted shares 1,753 1,748 1,767 The calculation of diluted earnings loss per share excludes 21 million share options 2008: 32 million: 2007: 17 million, which could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future, but which have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings loss per share as they are anti-dilutive in the year.
Basic and diluted earnings loss per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year into the weighted average number of shares for the year.
In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, management have chosen to present an adjusted profit for the year which excludes items that may distort comparability.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identied to help explain underlying performance.
