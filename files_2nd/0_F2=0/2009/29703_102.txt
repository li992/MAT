85 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 28 Related party transactions continued In 2007 the Company advanced a loan of 624,000 to SVG Investment Managers Limited, for regulatory capital purposes, which remains outstanding.
Interest of 5% per annum is payable on the loan.
At 31 December 2008 SVGA had provided a loan of 15.0 million to SVG Capital at a commercial interest rate.
A repayment of 2.0 million was made during the year.
In December 2009 SVGA paid a dividend of 13.0 million to SVG Capital, which was used to fully repay the loan.
During the year the Company received dividends of 13.0 million from SVGA 2008: 15.0 million, 0.4 million from SVGIM 2008: 0.4 million and 0.4 million 2008: 0.02 million from the Platinum Trust.
SVGA also received a dividend of $0.1 million from SVGNA.
There were no other distributions paid by subsidiaries during the year.
At 31 December 2009 the Company had uncalled commitments of 78.8 million to nine private equity funds that are being warehoused for future product launches.
These funds have been reclassified in 2009 as investments rather than current assets.
During the year SVGA received 1.6 million of Diamond I Loan Notes and 1.0 million of Diamond II Loan Notes, as part of its ongoing investment advisory fee arrangements.
These Notes were purchased from SVGA by SVG Capital plc at par value on the date of issue, as the holding of investments is the main activity of the parent company.
As previously disclosed, the Diamond Investment Scheme enabled external Diamond Advisory Committee Members to purchase shares in Diamond I & II from SVG Capital.
Likewise Diamond II shares were made available to SVGA staff.
Until shares have been transferred they remain in the name of SVG Capital but are held on trust for the beneficiaries, pending settlement.
A total of 1,035,000 Diamond I shares were sold at NAV to the Diamond Advisory Committee.
A further 3,090,000 Diamond II shares were sold at NAV to staff and Diamond Advisory Committee members.
At 31 December 2009 the total amounts receivable by the Company under their Scheme was 1.7 million 2008: 4.5 million.
A total of 750,000 Diamond I shares and 890,000 Diamond II shares were repurchased by the Company during the year at prevailing NAV.
Of these, all the Diamond I shares and 750,000 Diamond II shares were purchased from Key Capital and the other 140,000 Diamond II shares were purchased from Andrew Williams children.
Related party transactions during the year were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms length transactions.
29 Risk Financial instruments and risk profile The Companys primary investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing principally in private equity funds which are managed or advised by Permira, a leading international private equity specialist.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date, other than the interest rate swap agreements referred to in note 20, which are used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates with respect to the floating rate Senior Notes in issue.
SVG Advisers Limited has entered into forward currency contracts, referred to in note 19, which are used to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, since the majority of its fee income is euro-denominated but its ongoing costs are primarily sterling-denominated.
Additional risks faced by the Group are explained as part of the Business Review on pages 20 to 25 and should be read in conjunction with the analysis of financial risks outlined below.
Floating rate financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term deposits and AAA-rated money market funds.
All financial assets are included at fair value.
87 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 29 Risk continued b Financial liabilities The Company had 224 million nominal 2008: 336 million nominal of Senior Notes outstanding at the year end.
The Company had in place a loan facility of 550 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, The Bank of Scotland plc and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG at 31 December 2009, from which it had drawn 110 million 2008: nil at the balance sheet date.
Following the year end, the loan facility was renegotiated.
The maximum size of the facility is currently 325 million and the term has been extended until January 2013.
The Company had 115 million nominal 2008: 120 million of subordinated convertible bonds in issue at the balance sheet date.
The level of borrowing will impact on the Groups performance by amplifying the effect of movements in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
In addition to financial liabilities note 20, the Company also has uncalled fund commitments note 21 as at 31 December 2009 of 371 million 2008: 493 million, which are discussed below as part of commitment liquidity risk.
It should also be noted that fund investments and underlying investee companies may also utilise borrowings to varying degrees.
This is particularly the case with respect to CLO funds and structured private equity funds of funds, which are highly leveraged vehicles.
Currency denomination of the financial liabilities of the Group: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 000 000 Sterling 154,032 159,021 Euro 125,337 38,280 US dollar 160,180 237, 533 439,549 434,834 Gross contractual cash-flows cumulative interest and principal amounts payable on the liabilities of the Group are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 000 000 Loan facility drawndowns final maturity date 17 January 2013 106,451 Senior Notes due 18 July 2013 124,900 186,886 Senior Notes due 18 July 2014 127, 350 188,753 Senior Notes due 18 July 2015 54,993 71,678 Convertible Bonds due 5 June 2016 176,592 194,250 Other creditors 10,249 6,729 Forward currency contracts gross payments 15,993 7,196 Interest rate swaps net payments 1,573 1,259 618,101 656,751 Based on exchange rates at each year end and allowing for interest rate swaps.
A more detailed analysis of the maturity profile of the Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and gross-settled derivatives based on contractual undiscounted cash flows and year-end exchange rates is shown below.
Gross settled derivatives are calculated based on the spot prices at the year-end.
Financial liabilities maturity The maturity groupings are based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date.
When a counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group can be required to pay.
For loan facility drawdowns this will be within three months, although the amounts will be available to be re-drawn, subject to compliance with loan covenants.
For the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that the outstanding loan amount will remain drawn until the quarter-end prior to the expiry date of the facility, i. e. 31 December 2012.
Financial assets maturity Analysis of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss into maturity groupings is based on the long-term nature of these assets and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that no distributions or realisations will occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Beyond that it is extremely difficult to judge the precise size or timing of such cash flows.
It is, however, a requirement under IFRS 7 to disclose such an analysis and therefore a breakdown is provided in the following table for illustrative purposes.
It is emphasised that the analysis is provided to comply with accounting standards.
It is not a forecast and should not be construed as such.
It is based on broad assumptions, further details of which are provided below the table.
For other assets, the analysis into maturity groupings is based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date or if earlier, the expected date the assets will be realised.
1 month 13 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 31 December 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 Derivatives Forward currency contracts Gross cash inflow 4,006 8,558 2,043 14,607 Gross cash outflow 4,442 9,330 2,221 15,993 Interest rate swaps Net cash inflow outflow 166 181 1,226 1,573 602 953 1,404 2,959 Available liquidity gap 135,945 7,506 14,503 227,018 97,202 453,168 The Groups actual liquidity profile is likely to be somewhat different to the analysis outlined above.
In particular, it is very difficult to predict the quantum and timing of returns on the Groups long-term investment portfolio.
As already mentioned, it is important to note that the maturity analysis in respect of financial assets at fair value i. e. the investment portfolio is highly subjective and is not a forecast of the expected cash flows.
The amounts receivable within three months are based on actual cash flows.
The residual balance has been allocated 70:30 between less than and more than five years.
This is considered to be a reasonable and prudent estimate, but is no more than that.
The Groups undrawn loan facility amounts to 215 million.
Uncalled fund commitments At 31 December 2009, the Group had uncalled fund commitments of 371 million, which are expected to be drawn over a number of years.
It should be noted that when these commitments are funded they will typically be used to make investments and therefore create an asset that would be expected to be realised for cash over the longer term.
Risks The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are considered to be commitment risk and valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing these and other risks as summarised below.
The Directors consider that the risks faced by the Group are primarily those faced by the Company.
89 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 29 Risk continued Commitment liquidity risk The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 21.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 371.1 million 2008: 492.8 million, compared to cash balances of 144.1 million 2008: 131.1 million and shareholders funds of 620.4 million 2008: 434.2 million.
The Company is a closed-ended investment trust and is therefore not subject to redemption requests from its investors.
The Companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, the Companys commitments to private equity funds and other financial liabilities will be financed by available cash resources and distributions received on the realisation of underlying investments within the fund portfolio, although in the current market environment it is not anticipated that there will be significant realisations from the investment portfolio in the short term.
In addition, the Group currently has a 325 million loan facility that could be drawn on, subject to financial covenants as described in note 20, to meet fund commitments as they fall due.
The Board monitors liquidity risk and, if considered appropriate, could renegotiate its lending arrangements or issue new securities.
The Groups investments are mainly illiquid but, in extremis, the Board could consider selective disposals of long-term investments, if required to meet commitments as they fall due.
In these circumstances it is possible, dependent on prevailing market conditions, that the realisation value of such assets could be at a significant discount to their previous carrying value.
A residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor to the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
In December 2008 the Company agreed to reduce its commitment to Permira IV.
The total direct commitment by the Company to Permira IV was 2.4 billion, of which 51.6% had been called.
The Company elected to cap its commitment at 60% of the total.
At 31 December 2009 the Company had an uncalled commitment to Permira IV of 166 million 2008: 202 million, which will only be called to finance follow-on investments and fees.
The terms of these arrangements require that future distributions from the realisation of portfolio companies receivable by those investors in Permira IV that elected to cap their commitments will be reduced by 25%, such benefit to accrue to the Limited Partners that did not elect to cap their uncalled commitments.
The Companys loan facility expires in January 2013.
The Senior Notes in issue mature between July 2013 to July 2015 see note 20.
The Convertible Bonds are repayable in 2016.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash flow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Board.
Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 26 and 27 and a detailed analysis of the 20 largest underlying companies is given on pages 17 to 19.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 54 to 58, all underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
The IPEV Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted that a large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies are expected to be unquoted and therefore the valuation of such companies involves exercising judgement.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Company, in 2009 the Group benefited from gains on its investment portfolio totalling 57.5 million 2008: loss of 818.6 million.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Companys levels of borrowing see note 20 and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
It will also be affected by leverage in the funds in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such funds, which is considered separately under currency risk.
At 31 December 2009, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss, would result in a 14.4% 2008: 17.3% change in Shareholders funds.
Valuation risk will be affected by leverage in the underlying investee companies.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations of the 20 largest underlying investee companies, which had an aggregate valuation before providing for carried interest of 740.2 million or 92.9% of the gross private equity fund portfolio valuation 2008: 568.9 million or 91.3%, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical fair value fair value 10% writeFair value 10% uplift down million million million 31 December 2009 Gross valuation of 20 largest investee companies 740.2 943.3 560.7 Change in valuation effect on income 27.4% 24.3% 31 December 2008 Gross valuation of 20 largest investee companies 568.9 754.0 388.8 Change in valuation effect on income 32.6% 31.6% All investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices and recently acquired unquoted investments may be carried at cost.
For such investments, a 10% movement in the valuation basis will have a 10% impact on fair value.
For unquoted investments valued on a different basis, such as earnings-related, a 10% movement in the earnings of the investee company will not necessarily result in a 10% change in fair value, because of other factors such as the level of debt utilised by the investee companies.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
Notes to the accounts continued 90 29 Risk continued Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In a majority of the funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding fiduciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
Concentration risk The Directors believe that the diversified nature of the underlying investments in the Groups private equity fund portfolio reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
However, it should be noted that, in accordance with its stated investment objective, the Group intends to focus its investments principally in private equity funds that are managed or advised by Permira.
As outlined in note 9, the future performance of the Group will therefore be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest see notes 3 and 30 for an indication of the Groups exposures.
The Directors believe that this represents an opportunity, but investors should also be aware that greater concentration of the investment portfolio also presents a risk.
Interest rate risk The Groups revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since a large portion of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on its Senior Notes and drawings on the loan facility that may be taken out from time to time.
The Companys primary objective is to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate risk is indirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it is not possible to quantify such effects.
Interest rates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specific level, interest rates and credit spreads also have an important role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly financed by debt.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately.
At 31 December 2009, the Group held investments in AAA-rated money market funds valued at 126.4 million 2008: 111.4 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds are redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Other floating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had 220.6 million 2008: 332.2 million of Senior Notes in issue and 100.1 million 2008: 102.6 million of Bonds see note 20.
Interest rate risk on the Senior Notes and the Bonds is mitigated as the Bonds and most of the Notes pay fixed rates of interest and swap agreements have been taken out with respect to the floating rate notes.
The weighted average interest rate payable on the Notes and the swaps amounted to 8.7% at 31 December 2009.
The timing of the cash flows in respect of the interest rate swaps exactly matches those of the floating rate notes that are being hedged.
All interest payments on the Senior Notes are effectively fixed and the Company considers that the swaps are effective in providing a hedge against interest rate risk.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps included in the balance sheet amount to a liability of 775,000 at 31 December 2009 2008 liability of 846,000 and have been valued by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, the swap counterparty.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group unless otherwise disclosed.
The Group is subject to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with a credit rating of AA or better.
Cash equivalents at the year end comprised money market funds with a variety of counterparties, each fund having a credit rating of AAA.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
However, the Group has issued Senior Notes of US$345 million and 40 million, respectively, which act as a partial hedge against assets denominated in those currencies and could be swapped into other currencies if deemed appropriate.
The Group also has a 325 million loan facility which, if drawn, would act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
The Group has also entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate against movements in exchange rates.
These contracts are primarily to provide a cash flow hedge against euro-denominated investment management and advisory fees receivable by subsidiary companies in 2009 and 2010.
The total outstanding under such contracts at 31 December 2009 amounted to a sale of 18.0 million in exchange for 14.6 million.
A fair value loss of 1.4 million 2008: 5.7 million was taken to equity in respect of these contracts as a result of the appreciation of euro against sterling since the contracts were entered into.
