The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after off set for fi financial reporting purposes: 2009 2008 m m Deferred tax liabilities 32.4 32.6 Deferred tax assets 2.5 3.2 29.9 29.4 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and other temporary diff erences of 251.2 million 2008: 123.4 million available for off set against future profi ts.
These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profi ts in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
Included in the unrecognised deferred tax asset is 0.6 million 2008: 0.3 million which relates to losses which will expire by 2014.
Other losses may be carried forward indefi nitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary diff erences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2008: 36.6 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these diff erences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary diff erences and it is probable that such diff erences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary diff erences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignifi cant.
