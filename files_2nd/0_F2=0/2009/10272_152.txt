In relation to 3.0m credited to reserves in 2009, there is a 1.5m credit relating to defined benefit pension schemes and a 1.5m credit relating to share-based payment arrangements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
