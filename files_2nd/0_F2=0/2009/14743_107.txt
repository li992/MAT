These shares are then held in trust for a period of 5 years, at which point they are transferred at no further cost to the employee.

These shares may be withdrawn at any point during years four and five, but income tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
iii Deferred bonus scheme This scheme applied to senior managers and executive directors.
Those eligible were awarded shares based on performance in the year.
These shares were purchased shares and are held in trust on behalf of the employee for a period of three years, at which point the employee is entitled to exercise the award.
In addition to shares purchased using the adjusted bonus award, additional shares will also be purchased by the Trustee using amounts received equivalent to any dividends which would have been received on the shares held by the trust.
If the employee resigns, they lose all outstanding awards.
This scheme has been replaced by the current Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under this scheme, 25% of all eligible employees annual bonus is deferred into shares which only vest after three years, subject to continued service.
The number of shares awarded is determined by dividing the relevant pre-tax bonus amount by the share price shortly after the announcement of the results for the financial year to which the bonus relates.
iv Performance Share Plan This scheme applies to executive directors and senior executives.
The level of these awards are subject to certain performance conditions over the three year performance period, which can be summarised as follows: Date of award 27 July 2006 26 July 2007 10 June 2008 Maximum value of award as a % of base salary 100 150 150 Performance conditions Total shareholder return 50% of award i Full vesting 75th percentile 75th percentile 75th percentile 25% vesting median median 30% vesting median Earnings per share 50% of award ii Full vesting RPI 8% RPI 9% RPI 9% 25% vesting RPI 3% RPI 3% 30% vesting RPI 3% FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scottish and Southern Energy 126 Annual Report 2009 Notes on the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March 28.

The fair-value of shares in the share incentive plan is not subject to valuation using the Black-Scholes model.
However, the fair-value of shares granted in the year is equal to the weighted average price and is based on the price paid for the shares at the grant date as shares are acquired out of the market as at that date to satisfy awards made under the scheme.
