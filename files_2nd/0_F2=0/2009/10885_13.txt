These included pension curtailment costs arising as a result of redundancies of 8m 2008: 9m, and other business reorganisation costs.
ii Environmental provision related charges include 5m due to movements in discount rates arising from reductions in market risk free rates due to the current economic conditions together with 8m arising from changes in landfill tax legislation in the UK.
iii Pension deficit charges arise from recovery plan contributions to the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
iv Remeasurements gains on derivative financial instruments comprise gains and losses arising on derivative financial instruments reported in the income statement.
These exclude gains and losses for which hedge accounting has been effective, which have been recognised directly in equity or offset by adjustments to the carrying value of debt.
v The exceptional tax credit in the prior period arose from a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% included in the Finance Act 2007.
This resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities.
vi The exceptional tax charge in the period arose from changes to the industrial building allowances IBA in the 2008 Finance Act.
This resulted in an increase in deferred tax liabilities.
Pensions Substantially all of National Grid Gass employees are members of the defined benefit section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to National Grid Gas.
Accordingly, National Grid Gas accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
For further details regarding the nature and terms of the scheme and the actuarial assumptions used to value the assets and pension obligations, refer to note 27.
The following disclosures relate to the scheme as a whole and include amounts not recognised in these regulatory accounting statements, but which are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of National Grid plc.

As a result, an effective tax rate for other activities before and after exceptional items and remeasurements has not been presented.
Factors that may affect future tax charges A number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the April 2009 Budget Statement which are expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2009.
The changes include temporary changes to the capital allowances regime and the introduction of a system for taxing foreign profits, which is expected to bring in a dividend exemption and a worldwide debt cap.
The dividend exemption is likely to be available for both UK and foreign distributions, falling within an exempt classification, received on or after 1 July 2009.
This is not expected to have a material effect on our future tax charge.
The worldwide debt cap is likely to restrict the amount of finance expense available for UK tax purposes, based on the consolidated finance expense, and is expected to apply for the accounting period ended 31 March 2011 onwards.
We are in the process of evaluating the impact the worldwide debt cap will have on our future tax charge.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore any effects on the tax charge have not been included in these financial statements.

The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2009 was 85m 2008: 69m.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory Accounting Statements 2008 09 77 There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
National Grid Gas has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2009, 5m of the total restructuring provision 2008: 6m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, largely to be paid over the next two financial years.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2009 include 21m 2008: 18m in respect of employer liability claims and rectification costs of 11m associated with gas metering regulators 2008: 6m.
