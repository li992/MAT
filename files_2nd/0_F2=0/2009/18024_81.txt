CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009 20.
Financial risk management continued Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and hybrid financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest coverage ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to assets ratio of 50 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 160 per cent.
These targets have not been met during the period due to current conditions in the UK commercial property market.
These are discussed in the Review of Business and Future Developments.

Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Fair value through profit or loss - 224.7 - 224.7 Total liabilities - 224.7 - 224.7 Fair value hierarchy Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets.
Level 2: valuation techniques are used, maximising the use of observable market data, either directly from market prices or derived from market prices.
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.
