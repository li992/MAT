FINANCIAL Parent STATEMENTS company Notes on the parent company financial statements 1 Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in the UK, the US and Asia.
The Group operates in the UK through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited and M&G Investment Management Limited.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In Asia, the Groups main operations are in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
The Company is responsible for the financing of each of its subsidiaries.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006, which applies to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement on the basis that its cash flow is included within the cash flow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, from the requirements of this standard on the basis that the Companys results are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group that include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is equivalent to FRS 29.
This included exemption from the requirements for enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risk of the Amendments to FRS 29 Improving disclosures about financial instruments approved by the Accounting Standards Board ASB in May 2009 and effective from 1 January 2009.
The enhanced disclosures as required by the equivalent Amendments to IFRS 7 have been included in note G Financial assets and liabilities of the consolidated financial statements.
The amendments to FRS 8 Related Party Transactions became effective for the Company in 2009.
The amendments made were to align the definition of related party with that in UK law and IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
The main effect of this amendment is that there is no longer an exemption from disclosure of related party transactions in the Companys financial statements on the basis that these financial statements are presented with the consolidated financial statements.
The Company is required under the amendment to disclose any transactions with subsidiaries which are not wholly-owned.
The Company did not have any disclosable transactions under this amendment.
Additionally, in 2009, the Company adopted the following new accounting pronouncements.
Their adoption had no material impact on the financial statements of the Company: Amendment on FRS 26 financial instruments Eligible Hedged Items Amendments to UITF Abstract 42 and FRS 26 Embedded Derivatives Amendments to FRS 20 Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2008 3 Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage interest rate and currency exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Under FRS 26, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity, or, for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
293 Notes on the parent company financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date in respect of the prior reporting period are treated as a non-adjusting event.
Where scrip dividends are issued, the value of such shares, measured as the amount of the cash dividend alternative, is credited to reserves and the amount in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued is transferred from the share premium account to retained profit.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups largest pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and applied the requirements of FRS 17 as amended in December 2006 to its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 8.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit and loss account.
To the extent that part or all of the Companys interest in the pension surplus is not recognised as an asset, the unrecognised surplus is initially applied to extinguish any past service costs, losses on settlements or curtailments that would otherwise be included in the profit and loss account.
Next, the expected investment return on the schemes assets is restricted so that it does not exceed the total of the current service cost, interest cost and any increase in the recoverable surplus.
Any further adjustment for the unrecognised surplus is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains and losses also include adjustment for unrecognised pension surplus as described above.
294 Prudential plc Annual Report 2009 FINANCIAL Parent STATEMENTS company Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Under the principles of UITF 44, where the Company, as the parent company, grants options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in the subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

vii Interest on the US$300 million 6.5 per cent borrowings was swapped into floating rate payments but, in 2008, swapped back into fixed rate payments of 6.5 per cent.
viii Hedge accounting is applied at both the Group consolidated level and Company level.
Due to different dates of commencement of this accounting treatment, the hedge values differ between these two levels.
ix These borrowings support a short-term fixed income securities programme.
x The Company originally issued 200 million Floating Rate Notes in October 2008 which matured in April 2009.
New 200 million Notes were issued in April 2009, which matured in October 2009, and again in October 2009 which will mature in April 2010.
All Notes have been wholly subscribed to by a Group subsidiary and accordingly have been eliminated on consolidation in the Group financial statements.

The Company has a US$300 million fair value hedge in place which hedges the interest rate exposure on the US$300 million 6.5 per cent perpetual subordinated capital securities.
In addition, the Company had a US$1,000 million fair value hedge which hedged the interest rate exposure on the US$1,000 million 6.5 per cent perpetual subordinated capital securities until this hedge was cancelled in March 2009.
The derivative financial instruments were valued internally using standard market practices.
In accordance with the Companys risk management framework, all internally generated valuations are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
8 Pension scheme financial position The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS which is primarily a closed defined benefit scheme.
At 31 December 2009, on the FRS 17, Retirement Benefits basis of valuation, the underlying pension liabilities of PSPS accounted for 86 per cent 2008: 87 per cent of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
However, the individual accounts of the Company continue to follow UK GAAP including FRS 17.
The FRS 17 disclosures are aligned with IAS 19.
In 2008, the Group adopted IFRIC 14, interpretation guidance to IAS 19 with the effect of derecognising the Groups interest in PSPS surplus and recognising an additional liability for the deficit funding obligation for PSPS in the Group financial statements.
Further details are described in note I2 Staff and pension plans of the notes on the financial statements of the Group.
At 31 December 2005, the allocation of surpluses and deficits attaching to PSPS between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the Prudential Assurance Companys PAC with-profits funds was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2009.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
Defined benefit schemes are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
PSPS was last actuarially valued as at 5 April 2008 using the projected unit method.
This valuation demonstrated the Scheme to be 106 per cent funded by reference to the Scheme Solvency Target that forms the basis of the Schemes statutory funding objective.
Accordingly, the total contributions to be made by the Group to the Scheme were reduced from the previous arrangement of 70-75 million per annum to 50 million per annum effective from 1 July 2009.
As PSPS was in a surplus position at the valuation date, no formal recovery plan was required.
However, recognising that there had been a significant deterioration in the value of the Schemes assets from 5 April 2008 to the date of the finalisation of the valuation, contributions to the Scheme for additional funding of 25 million per annum as well as a 25 million per annum employers contribution for ongoing service of current employees, were agreed with the PSPS Trustees subject to a reassessment when the next valuation is completed.
The additional funding is akin to deficit funding.
In 2009, total contributions for the year, including expenses and augmentations, were 67 million 2008: 79 million.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Partners, for the valuation of PSPS, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2009 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.

In 2008, an amount of 9 million was applied to extinguish the curtailment credit attributable to the Company from the unrecognised portion of the pension surplus at 31 December 2008.
There was no such amount applied against the pension charge in 2009.

The experience gains on scheme liabilities in 2008 of 127 million related mainly to the true-up reflecting improvements in data consequent upon the ongoing triennial valuation of PSPS.
The actuarial gains losses attributable to the Company are net of the apportionment to the PAC with-profits fund and are related to the surplus recognised on the balance sheet of the Company.
In 2009, the actuarial losses attributable to the Company included an amount of 66 million 2008: 164 million for the unrecognised portion of surplus which has not been deducted from the pension charge.
The actuarial losses before tax of 3 million 2008: 143 million attributable to the Company are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Cumulative actuarial gains as at 31 December 2009 amount to 88 million 2008: 91 million.
The 2005 actuarial losses attributable to the Company reflected the changed estimate of allocation in the deficit of PSPS from a ratio of 20 80 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund prior to 2005 to a ratio of 30 70 from 2005 onwards.
Total employer contributions expected to be paid into the PSPS defined benefit scheme for the year ending 31 December 2010 amount to 54 million, reflecting the new funding arrangement agreed in 2009, following the completion of the 2008 actuarial valuation, and expenses.
