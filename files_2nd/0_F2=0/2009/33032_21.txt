Segmental analysis Primary reporting format business segments The groups principal activities include: the provision of networked IT services: local, national and international telecommunications services: broadband and internet products and services: and converged xed mobile products and services.
The group is organised into four customer-facing lines of business, BT Global Services, BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach, which are supported by two internal functional units, BT Design and BT Operate.
The activities of each of the customer-facing lines of business are as follows: BT Global Services serves major corporate, carrier and government organisations across the world, providing high-performance managed networked IT services, application management, professional services and outsourcing solutions.
BT Retail serves consumer customers and small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs in the UK, providing a range of innovative communications products and services.
BT Retail also includes BT Ireland, which operates across the major corporate, SME, consumer and wholesale markets throughout the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Enterprises, which comprises a number of individual businesses such as BT Conferencing, BT Directories and BT Payphones.
BT Wholesale provides services to UK communications providers through a diverse portfolio ranging from nationally available broadband, voice and data connectivity services and interconnect to bespoke, fully managed network outsourcing and value-added solutions.
Openreach is responsible for the crucial first mile connecting communications providers customers to their local telephone exchange, giving them equal, open and economic access to the UK network.
Openreach products are sold on an equivalent basis to BT lines of business and other communications providers at the same arms length prices, with the BT lines of business being treated no differently than any other customer with regard to terms and conditions or access to systems and data.
BT Design and BT Operate are internal functional units which support the four customer-facing lines of business.
BT Design is responsible for the design and build of the platforms, systems and processes which support the provision of the groups products and services, and BT Operate is responsible for their operation.
The groups reportable segments are the four customer-facing lines of business: neither BT Design nor BT Operate are reportable segments.
Neither BT Design nor BT Operate generate any revenue and both operate on a cost recovery basis.
The costs incurred by BT Design and BT Operate are allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
The depreciation and amortisation incurred by BT Operate in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the customer-facing lines of business are allocated to the lines of business based on their respective utilisation.
The assets managed by BT Operate and their capital expenditure in the year are also allocated to the lines of business in a manner consistent with their depreciation and amortisation.
Accordingly, the segmental results do not necessarily reect the operating results of the lines of business as if they were independent business operations.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business.
In addition to the four customer-facing lines of business, the remaining operations of the group are aggregated and included within the Other category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group.
In the prior year, the results of Other included any over or under recovery of costs by BT Design and BT Operate.
In the current year, all costs from BT Design and BT Operate have been fully allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
This amounts to 32m of operating costs and 129m of depreciation and amortisation in the year to 31 March 2009.
In 2008, there was no such allocation as we were transforming the business and developing the trading model.

b Leaver costs exclude manager leaver costs associated with the groups transformation and reorganisation activities during 2009 and 2008.
Manager leaver costs associated with the transformation activities have been recorded as a specic item.
Other leaver costs are included within wages and salaries and social security costs.
c Research and development expenditure includes amortisation of 431m 2008: 325m, 2007: 314m in respect of internally developed computer software.
In 2009, the group recognised contract and financial review charges of 1,639m, of which 1,598m was recorded within other operating costs and 41m was recorded as a reduction to revenue.
As described on page 10, the financial review covered the financial performance of BT Global Services and its balance sheet position.
The contract reviews covered the largest and most complex contracts.
These charges reect a more cautious view of the recognition of future cost efficiencies and other changes in the underlying assumptions and estimates, particularly in the light of the current economic outlook and events occurring during the year.
The total charge of 1,639m was allocated against the following assets and liabilities: intangible assets 241m: non current trade and other receivables 913m: prepayments 52m: accrued income 41m: provisions 256m: 136m was allocated against a number of other balance sheet categories and the individual amounts are insignicant.

Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this analysis, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This denition of net debt measures balances at the expected value of future undiscounted cash ows due to arise on maturity of financial instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the effective interest method as required by IAS 39.
In addition, the gross balances are adjusted to take account of netting arrangements amounting to 160m 2008: 256m.
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure since it is not dened in accordance with IFRS, but it is a key indicator used by management in order to assess operational performance and balance sheet strength.

The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the sector in which the CGU operates.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The growth rates used in 2009 are higher than those used in previous years and are more closely aligned to managements assessment for each CGUs long-term growth.
Sensitivities For the BT Retail CGUs, significant headroom exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 850m.
The following changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: a reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.5% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 0.0% or less: an increase in the discount rate from the 11.1% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 12.9% or more: a reduction in the projected operating cash ows across five years by 18% or more.
A reduction in forecast operating cash ows could arise from the lower than anticipated realisation of cost savings from the revised operating model, particularly in the next two financial years.

Deferred taxation continued At 31 March 2009, the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 24.3bn 2008: 23.3bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2009 Expiry of m losses Restricted losses: Americas 271 2009-2029 Europe 1,875 2009-2024 Total restricted losses 2,146 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 3,410 No expiry Capital losses 17,780 No expiry Other 932 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 22,122 Total 24,268 At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 10.1bn 2008: 10.6bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.

At 31 March 2009, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O UK Limited prior to its demerger with O on 19 November 2 2 2001.
O plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure is US$110m as at 31 March 2009 2008: 2 US$72m, approximately 77m 2008: 36m, although this could increase by a further US$399m 2008: US$402m, approximately 278m 2008: 202m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
2 The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS universal mobile telecommunication system auction in 2000.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor has appealed the courts decision.
If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK government set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on state aid.
It concluded that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision has now been appealed, but the company continues to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless, and that the appeal will not succeed.
