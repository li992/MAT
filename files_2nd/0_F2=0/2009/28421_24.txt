In addition, during the severe equity market conditions experienced in the first quarter of 2009, coupled with historically high equity volatility, the Group entered into exceptional short-dated hedging contracts to protect against potential tail events on the Group IGD capital position.
These contracts were in addition to the Groups regular operational hedging programmes.
It also disposed of its Taiwan agency business.
The effect of these items has been shown separately from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The treatment of the Taiwan agency business within the comparatives is discussed below.
The amounts for these items are included in total EEV profit attributable to shareholders.
The Company believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit before tax and basic earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
This basis of presentation has been adopted consistently throughout this supplementary information.
ii The US broker-dealer and asset management result includes losses for Curian of 6 million 2008: 3 million.
iii The value of future profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered businesses are included in the profits for new business and the in-force value of the Groups long-term business.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the profits from management of internal and external funds.
For EEV basis reporting, Group shareholders other income is adjusted to deduct the expected margin for the year on management of covered business.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of covered business.
iv Restructuring costs comprise the charge of 23 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 4 million recognised on the EEV basis for the shareholders share of restructuring costs incurred by the PAC with-profits fund.
v In June 2009, the Group completed the previously announced sale of its Taiwan agency business.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the results of the Groups retained businesses the effect of disposal and the results of the Taiwan agency business are shown separately.
The presentation of the comparative results for full year 2008 has been adjusted accordingly as explained in note 18. vi Exchange translation The comparative results have been prepared using previously reported exchange rates.
