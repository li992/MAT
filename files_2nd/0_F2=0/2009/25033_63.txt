Fair value of equity-settled awards The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the grant date.
The weighted average fair value of the equity-settled awards granted during the year was 5,856,709 2008: 7,548,086 at the grant date.
For SIP awards, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date without making an adjustment for expected dividends as awardees are entitled to dividends over the vesting period.
For LTIP awards made to UK staff in the years ended 31 May 2005 and 31 May 2007, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date after a deduction for the expected present value of future dividends over the vesting period.
LTIP awards made to Australian staff for these periods, and awards made in the year ended 31 May 2008 and subsequent periods, are legally categorised as options and the fair value was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model Monte Carlo for year ended 31 May 2009, using the following inputs: Grant date 16 May 7 Aug 23 July 30 Sept 2005 2006 2007 2008 Share price at grant date pence 112.25p 217.00p 312.25p 313.75p Expected life of awards years 3.18 2.97 3.00 3.00 Risk-free interest rate % 5.00 5.00 5.75 4.06 Expected volatility % 34 32 32 40 Expected dividend yield % 3.73 3.04 3.42 5.50 26.
