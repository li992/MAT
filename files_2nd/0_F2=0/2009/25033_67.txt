IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 87 30.
Financial instruments continued Market risk continued Exposure to market risk The Group has exposure to market risk to the extent that it has a residual un-hedged position.
The Groups exposure to market risk at any point in time depends primarily on short-term market conditions and client activities during the trading day.
The exposure at each balance sheet date is therefore not considered representative of the market risk exposure faced by the Group over the year.
The Groups exposure to market risk is determined by the exposure limits described above which change from time to time.
The most significant market risk faced by the Group is on equity positions including shares and indices which are highly correlated and managed on a portfolio basis.
Other exposures, including foreign exchange, commodities and interest rates, do not give rise to significant market risk.
The equity exposure at the balance sheet date and details of the exposure limit at the year end and for the year then ended is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Equity exposure at year end 8,868 12,920 Equity exposure limit at year end 15,000 15,000 Average equity exposure limit for the year 15,000 15,000 The Group has no significant concentration of market risk.
Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis shows the potential impact of large moves in equity markets on revenue.
The percentage applied is based upon the Groups assessment of movements in equity markets and is considered to represent a single day market fall that is reasonably possible.
Equity Market Potential exposures movement revenue 2009 applied impact 000 % 000 Equities 8,868 10% 887 The Groups average daily gain from financial instruments classified as held for trading was 989,000 2008: 708,000 and therefore the potential revenue impact shown above represents 0.9 days trading 2008: 0.9.
Reasonably possible movements in other markets have no significant impact on the Groups revenue.
Changes in risk variables have no direct impact on the Groups equity as the Group has no financial instruments classified as available for sale, or designated in hedging relationships.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 88 Notes to the Financial Statements 30.
Financial instruments continued Market risk continued Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exposures arise in the normal course of business and the management of this risk forms part of the risk policies outlined above.
Limits on the exposures which the Group will accept in each currency are set by the Risk Committee and the Group hedges its exposures as necessary with market counterparties.
Foreign currency risk is managed on a Group-wide basis, while the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk is not considered by the directors to be significant.
The functional currency of each company in the Group is that denominated by the country of incorporation as disclosed in note 15.
The Groups currency exposures are measured and managed in Sterling.
The Groups exposure monitor measures foreign currency risks including currency balance sheet exposures, equity, commodity, interest and other positions denominated in foreign currencies and bets and trades on foreign currencies.
The Groups net exposure to foreign exchange risk based on notional amounts at each balance sheet date was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 US Dollar 2,095 12,548 Euro 98 8,074 Australian Dollar 237 313 Yen 209 1,497 Other 1,068 6,009 No sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups revenue and equity are not significant.
Interest rate risk The Group has interest rate risk arising from its trading activities which is hedged as part of the overall market risk management.
The Group offers bets and contracts for difference CFDs on interest rate derivatives and hedges its exposure using exchange-traded futures and options.
Exposure limits are set by the Risk Committee for each product, and also for groups of products where it is considered that their price movements are likely to be positively correlated.
Interest rate risk arising from trading activities is not considered by the directors to be significant and is measured by the Groups exposure monitor on a Group-wide basis.
The Group also has interest rate risk relating to financial instruments not at fair value through profit and loss such as cash held with banks which are not included in the Groups exposure monitor.
These exposures are not significant and are not hedged.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date was as follows: Group Within 1 year M ore than 5 years Total 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate Redeemable preference shares 8% 40 40 40 40 Floating rate Trade receivables 183,085 263,323 183,085 263,323 Trade payables 511,656 582,689 511,656 582,689 Cash and cash equivalents 520,421 471,722 520,421 471,722 191,850 152,356 40 40 191,810 152,316 Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 89 30.
Financial instruments continued Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Trade receivables and payables include client and broker balances upon which interest is paid or received based upon market rates.
Cash and cash equivalents includes client money equivalent to the amount included with trade payables.
Other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
No sensitivity analysis is presented for interest rate risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups revenue and equity are not significant.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
Management of credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group-wide basis.
The Group has credit exposure to the banks with which it deposits funds and the market counterparties with which it hedges.
The Group sets limits for its maximum exposure to each market counterparty and bank to which it has credit exposure.
Certain balances with brokers are held in segregated accounts with banks.
The pricing of credit default swaps and or credit ratings of both the banks and market counterparties are monitored on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required.
The principal credit risk in respect of clients arises from a clients trading position going into deficit through incurring a loss in excess of the required margin deposit.
The Group has no credit risk exposure to clients with Limited Risk accounts, which require each position to have a guaranteed stop such that the clients maximum loss is covered by the required deposit.
Other types of accounts are permitted to deal in circumstances where they may be capable of suffering losses greater than the funds they have on their account, or in limited circumstances are allowed credit.
The Group has a formal credit policy which determines the financial and experience criteria which a client must satisfy before being given an account which exposes the Group to credit risk, including trading limits for each client and strict margining rules.
In order to mitigate credit risk the Group continually monitors credit exposures and the margin situation on all client accounts.
Since October 2008, the Group has made changes to credit risk management and monitoring processes which have significantly reduced the level of bad debt experienced by the Group.
For the majority of clients this is achieved via an automated margin calling and close-out process whereby a clients trading positions are trimmed to prevent the account going into deficit.
The remaining minority of clients are not subject to automatic close-out, however these clients have a maximum period of 24 hours to provide additional margin once their account has moved into deficit.
The Group also accepts collateral from clients in the form of shares or other securities which mitigate credit risk and all such assets are individually assessed and discounted for expected market risk.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Group Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 520,421 471,722 122 46 Trade receivables due from brokers 178,261 252,522 Trade receivables - due from clients 4,824 10,801 703,506 735,045 122 46 The fair value of collateral held at 31 May 2009 against amounts due from clients was 595,000 2008: 4,521,000.
The Groups largest credit exposure to any one individual broker at 31 May 2009 was 49,529,000 or 27% of the exposure to all brokers 2008: 71,614,000, 28%.
Included in cash and cash equivalents, the Groups largest credit exposure to any bank at 31 May 2009 was 126,920,000 or 24% of the exposure to all banks 2008: 125,189,000, 27%.
The Group has no significant exposure to any one particular client.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 90 Notes to the Financial Statements 30.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk continued The balance of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables due from brokers, will fluctuate over the course of the reporting period.
The tables below present further detail on the Groups and the Companys exposure to credit risk.
External credit ratings Standard and Poors long term ratings or equivalent are available for exposures to brokers and banks, and these are shown below.
No external credit rating of clients is available and therefore the balances are unrated.
Amounts due from clients are considered past due from the date that positions are closed and are aged from that date.
If debtors arise on open positions the amounts due from clients are considered neither past due nor impaired unless impairment is provided.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk continued The Group records specific impairments of trade receivables due from clients in a separate allowance account.
Impairments are recorded where the Group determines that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts owing according to the contractual terms of the agreement.
There are no collective impairments taken, and no other assets are considered impaired.
Below is a reconciliation of changes in the separate allowance account during the period: 2009 2008 000 000 Balance at 1 June 5,864 2,849 Impairment loss for the year - gross charge for the year 22,544 4,510 - recoveries 4,376 453 Write-offs 438 1,010 Foreign exchange 303 32 Balance at 31 May 23,897 5,864 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations arising from its financial liabilities.
Management of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed centrally for the whole Group by the Risk department.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its broker margin requirements and liabilities when due, under both normal circumstances and stressed conditions.
In order to monitor and manage this risk, the Groups Risk department records the available funds daily and undertakes monthly liquidity stress testing.
The liquidity testing simulates what would happen to the Groups cash resources should there be a large single market fall and a sequential three-day market fall.
This testing requires a number of assumptions regarding the impact of large market moves on client and broker positions and balances and the resulting behaviour of clients and brokers in terms of maintaining or closing positions and settling margin requirements.
There were no changes in the management of liquidity risk during the year.
Exposure to liquidity risk Positions can be closed at any time by clients and can also be closed by the Group, in accordance with the Groups margining rules.
If after closing a position a client is in surplus, then the amount owing is repayable on demand by the Group.
When client positions are closed, corresponding positions relating to the hedged position are closed with brokers.
Accordingly the Group releases cash margin, which is repaid by brokers to the Group on demand.
In the event of a significant movement in world markets, IG could have a short-term funding requirement to meet its payment obligations to market counterparties and or winning clients before payment would be received from losing clients and or from market counterparties.
Any failure by IG to meet its payment obligations could result in market counterparties closing IGs hedge positions which would have materially adverse consequences for the Groups business.
The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is the level of working capital.
For this purpose working capital is the net of all trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade payables.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 92 Notes to the Financial Statements 30.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk continued Working capital at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Amounts due from brokers 178,261 252,522 Amounts due from clients 4,824 10,801 Cash and cash equivalents 520,421 471,722 Trade payables 511,656 582,689 191,850 152,356 The Groups liquidity risk under stressed conditions is mitigated by its committed bank facilities which amounted to 120.0m 2008: 160.0m at the year end.
Extraordinary movements in world markets during October 2008 resulted in a short-term funding requirement coinciding with large cash payments in respect of the interim dividend and acquisition of FXOnline and consequently the Group utilised its committed bank facilities for a period of 18 days, which were drawn to a peak of 88 million of an available 160 million.
In the directors opinion the Group has sufficient funds available to meet all operational requirements in the event of a large market movement.
Liquidity management is also dependent on credit risk management described above.
Residual contractual maturities of financial liabilities The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, excluding estimated interest payments.
Given the nature of trade payables representing liabilities to clients in respect of trading margin deposited, unrealised profits on open positions and surpluses held on account and the fact that open positions can be closed immediately, trade payables are presented in the table below as on demand.
On demand Over 5 years Total 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 Group Trade payables due to clients 511,656 582,689 511,656 582,689 Redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 40 511,656 582,689 40 40 511,696 582,729 Company Redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Groups processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks outlined above.
The directors are responsible for managing operational risk and have identified the following risks which are considered significant to the Group.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 93 30.
Financial instruments continued Technology The Groups operations are highly dependent on technology and advanced information systems.
Its ability to provide its clients with reliable, real-time access to its systems is fundamental to the success of the business.
Such dependency upon technology exposes the Group to significant risk in the event that such technology or systems experience any form of damage, interruption or failure.
The Group has business continuity procedures and policies in place which are designed to allow the Group to continue trading in its core markets and its systems are designed to mitigate the risk of failure of any component.
Where the Group is dependent upon providers of data, market information, telephone and internet connectivity, the Group mitigates against the risk of failure of any of these suppliers by ensuring that where possible multiple providers and data routes are utilised.
To remain competitive, the Group must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and other features of its software, network distribution systems and technologies.
Regulation The Groups spread betting, CFD and foreign exchange businesses are regulated in a number of jurisdictions.
In addition, three of the Groups subsidiaries are subject to regulation as licensed bookmakers by the Gambling Commission.
The Group is also subject to various regulation and legislation relating to technology, the provision of internet services and the use of the internet.
These regulatory frameworks impose restrictions on certain of the Groups activities and resources which place constraints on the Group operations and development.
The regulatory environment is regularly changing and imposes significant demands on the resources of the Group.
As the Groups activities expand, offering new products and penetrating new markets, these regulatory demands will inevitably increase.
The increasing complexity of the Groups operations require training and recruitment be tailored to meet these regulatory demands and the costs of compliance are expected to increase.
Capital management Regulatory capital The Groups lead regulator is the Financial Services Authority FSA.
Three of the Groups UK operating subsidiaries are regulated by the FSA which imposes a minimum level of regulatory capital which must be retained by each company and also an overall level of regulatory capital which must be maintained by the Group.
Given the Groups recent strong growth, profits have been and continue to be the primary source of new capital.
The Group is highly cash generative and plans to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% of earnings.
Capital resources are largely comprised of share capital and reserves, net of intangible assets and treasury shares.
Capital requirements are derived from credit risk, operational risk, counterparty risk and market risk considerations.
Capital resources, capital requirements and surplus capital at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Group Capital resources 147,263 127,480 Capital requirements 65,992 60,893 Surplus capital resources 81,271 66,587 The Group undertakes an annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP which is an internal assessment of its capital needs.
The outcome of the ICAAP is reviewed by the Audit Committee and subsequently approved by the Board.
The FSA periodically reviews the adequacy of the ICAAP and may set individual capital guidance resulting in additional capital requirements for the Group.
The regulatory capital requirements for credit risk and market risk are also calculated daily or intra-daily if required and monitored against expected ranges and available resources.
The regulatory capital resources and net surplus are recalculated monthly and reported to the board of directors.
The Groups subsidiaries in the United States, Singapore, Australia and Japan are also regulated by applicable regulators in the overseas jurisdiction.
Individual capital requirements in these jurisdictions are taken into account when managing the Groups capital resources.
There have been no material changes in the Groups management of capital during the year.
