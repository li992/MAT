The interest rate swaps are used to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, and are designated as cash flow hedges.
The fair value is determined by reference to observable market interest rates.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with a nominal value of CAD 13.5m to mitigate movements in foreign exchange on a highly probable forecast transaction, expected to occur during the next 12 months.
The fair value is determined by reference to observable foreign exchange rates.
The other derivative contracts used during the year were forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecast cash inflows in Scandinavian currencies and were designated as cash flow hedges.
The effectiveness of the hedges has been tested by means of a regression analysis and ineffectiveness was found to be negligible.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement in the period during which the hedged forecast transaction takes place.

London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report 2009 83 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Current borrowings The Company has Redeemable Class B shares.
Holders of B shares are entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend based on 75 per cent of six month LIBOR on 1 June and 1 December each year until 1 June 2009.

Non-current borrowings In July 2006, the Company issued a 250m bond which is unsecured and is due for repayment in 2016.
Interest is paid semi-annually in arrears.
The issue price of the bond was 99.679 per 100 nominal.
The coupon on the bond is dependent on the Companys credit rating with Moodys, which improved from Baa3 positive outlook to Baa2 stable in February 2009.
Changes in the credit rating since the bond was issued had led to increases in the coupon on the bond by 25 basis points in each of July 2007 and January 2008, which have been reflected in the prior year adjustment note 2.
The bond coupon was 6.375 per cent throughout the last financial year but the impact of the rating improvement will be to reduce the coupon to 6.125 per cent from July 2009.
