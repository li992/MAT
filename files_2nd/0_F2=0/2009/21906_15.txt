Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts, issued in January 2009 by The Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP recommends that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders funds.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2009 would have been 1,862,000 2008: 1,260,000. b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on a purchase date basis.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors at their fair value on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
c Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: realised and unrealised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised and unrealised exchange differences on forward foreign currency contracts: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end: special dividends of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital as set out in the policies below: and cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation.
d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date which the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an effective yield basis.
Other investment income and deposit interest are recognised on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 33 Notes to the Accounts continued e Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in future have occurred.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised at the standard rate of corporation tax without discounting.
The Company had no deferred tax assets or liabilities at the year end.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are all allocated to revenue with the exception of management fees which are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
Performance fees, which derive predominantly by virtue of the Companys capital performance, are charged 100 per cent to capital.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
g Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an effective yield basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Dividends Dividends are calculated on an amount per share as approved by the Board of Directors and are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid.
i Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Capital Reserve or Revenue Reserve depending on the nature of the gain or loss.
Rates of exchange at 30 September 2009 2008 US Dollar 1.5994 1.7825 Euro 1.0942 1.2690 Japanese Yen 143.1978 189.2338 34 British Assets Trust plc 2 Income 2009 2008 000 000 Income from investments Franked investment income 10,782 14,341 Unfranked investment income 2,070 1,691 Overseas dividends 3,120 3,019 Overseas interest 1,022 564 Special dividends credited to capital 873 16,994 20,488 Other income Deposit interest 214 1,575 Interest on VAT recovered see note 3 923 Option premium 136 Underwriting commission 238 88 1,375 1,799 Total income 18,369 22,287 Total income comprises: Dividends 13,902 18,233 Income from fixed interest securities 3,092 2,255 Interest 1,137 1,575 Option premium 136 Underwriting commission 238 88 18,369 22,287 Income from investments: Listed UK 12,852 16,905 Listed overseas 4,142 3,583 16,994 20,488 No special dividends were received during the year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 35 Notes to the Accounts continued 3 Management expenses 2009 2008 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Investment management fee: basic 283 849 1,132 403 1,211 1,614 performance fee 1,049 1,049 VAT related recoveries 1,369 196 1,565 318 1,172 1,490 1,086 1,702 616 85 39 124 Throughout the year the Companys investment manager was F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB.
FCIB receives a basic quarterly fee, payable in advance, equal to 0.075 per cent of the value of Companys total assets less current liabilities excluding loans.
FCIB also receives a performance-related fee calculated on an annual basis by reference to the performance of the Company against the benchmark index over each 12 month period ended on 30 September.
If the Companys net asset value total return for any such period exceeds the total return from the benchmark index, a performance-related fee is payable, on a sliding scale, at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent per annum of the value of equity shareholders funds at the end of the period, depending on the level of outperformance.
The maximum rate of performance-related fee is earned when the outperformance for a 12 month period is 3.0 per cent or more.
The contract between the Company and FCIB may be terminated at any time by either party giving six months notice of termination.
In the event of the Company terminating the contract by giving less than six months notice, FCIB is entitled to compensation calculated as a proportion of the fees payable by the Company in respect of the previous financial year prorated to the date of termination.
Basic investment management fees are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital.
Performance fees are charged 100 per cent to capital.
As a result of the European Court of Justice decision in 2007 that investment management fees payable by investment trusts are not, and should never have been, liable to value added tax VAT, the Company recovered an amount of 1,565,000 2008: 1,490,000 from FCIB in respect of VAT paid on investment management fees in previous years.
The amounts recovered have been recognised in the Income Statement and, where applicable, allocated between revenue and capital in the same ratio as the VAT originally suffered.
The Company also received interest of 923,000 2008: nil in respect of the VAT recoveries see note 2.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is unlikely that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the deferred tax asset could be deducted.
6 b Reconciliation of tax charge 2009 2008 A reconciliation of the current tax charge is set out below: 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before taxation 40,757 124,064 Corporation tax at standard rate of 28.0 per cent 2008: 29.0 per cent 11,412 35,978 Effects of: Non-taxable capital returns 7,960 40,227 Non-taxable UK dividend income 3,019 4,159 Non-taxable overseas dividend income 72 Movement in unutilised management expenses 429 81 Movement in overseas dividends taxable on receipt 68 9 Overseas tax suffered 293 295 Total current tax charge for the year 293 295 7 Dividends 2009 2008 000 000 Dividends on Ordinary Shares: Amounts recognised as dividends to shareholders during the year third quarterly interim of 1.40p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2008 2007: 1.356p 4,097 4,082 final of 1.734p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2008 2007: 1.638p 5,074 4,906 first quarterly interim of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 2008: 1.40p 4,219 4,165 second quarterly interim of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 2008: 1.40p 4,219 4,137 unclaimed dividends from previous years 16 17,593 17,290 Proposed third quarterly interim of 1.442p per share in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 2008: 1.40p 4,219 4,097 Proposed final of 1.786p per share in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 2008: 1.734p 5,199 5,074 9,418 9,171 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 7 Dividends continued 2009 000 Revenue available for distribution by way of dividends for the year 17,147 First quarterly interim dividend of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 4,219 Second quarterly interim dividend of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 4,219 Proposed third quarterly interim dividend of 1.442p per share in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 4,219 Proposed final quarterly interim dividend of 1.786p per share in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 5,199 Undistributed revenue for the purposes of Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 see page 19 709 based on 291,112,282 shares in issue at 13 November 2009.

The Companys capital is represented by the issued share capital, Capital Redemption Reserve, Capital Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
Capital redemption reserve The nominal value of Ordinary Shares bought back for cancellation is added to this reserve.
Capital reserve Items accounted for this reserve are detailed in accounting policy 1 c. Revenue reserve The net profit arising in the revenue column of the Income Statement is added to this reserve.
Dividends paid during the year are deducted from the reserve, and it is available for paying future dividends on the Companys shares.

As an investment trust the Company holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Company makes use of borrowings, as detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the Chairmans Statement, to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances held.
Listed fixed asset investments held see note 9 are valued at fair value.
For listed securities this is either bid price or the last traded price depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
The market value of the Companys bonds is disclosed on page 43.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet shown on page 31.
The fair value of the loans is not materially different from the carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movements: ii interest rate risk, being the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: iii credit risk, being the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: iv liquidity risk, being the risk that the Company may not be able to liquidate its investments quickly enough to meet its ongoing financial commitments: and v foreign currency risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings, investment purchases, investment sales and income will fluctuate because of movements in currency rates.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued The Company held the following categories of financial instruments as at 30 September 2009: 2009 2008 000 000 Financial assets Investment portfolio 429,158 401,838 Cash at bank and on deposit 13,663 17,962 Amounts due from brokers 557 600 Payments and accrued income 2,202 2,173 VAT related amounts due from investment manager 294 1,490 Financial liabilities 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,421 59,395 Revolving advance facility 27,701 30,066 Amounts due to brokers 1,928 210 Fee due to investment manager 1,049 Bond interest payable 207 207 Other creditors 826 669 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 14 and 15.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific market risk or gain exposure to a specific market.
As at the year end the Company held no exposure to derivatives other than hedged currency exposure as disclosed on page 46.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 20 per cent at 30 September 2009, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been negative 85.8 million 2008: negative 80.4 million.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 20 per cent at 30 September 2009, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been positive 85.8 million 2008: positive 80.4 million.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.

If the bank base rate had decreased by 1.0 per cent, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a profit of 140,000 2008: 121,000.
The calculations are based on the cash balances and the revolving advance facility as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Fixed rate The Company holds fixed interest investments and has fixed interest liabilities.

In the event that the Company decides to repay the bonds before their maturity date the terms of issue may result in a penalty for early repayment.
The fair value of the bonds, based on middle market prices, at 30 September 2009 was 63.5 million 2008: 63.1 million.
Non-interest bearing investments The Companys non-interest bearing investments are its equity investments which had a value of 374,361,000 as at 30 September 2009 2008: 372,299,000.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represents the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2009 2008 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 13,663 17,962 Balances due from brokers 557 600 Interest, dividends and other receivables 2,496 3,663 16,716 22,225 Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small due to the short settlement period involved and the diversity of counterparties used.
All the assets of the Company which are traded on a recognised exchange are held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports as described in the Report of the Directors on page 25.
The Managers have in place a monitoring procedure in respect of counterparty risk which is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is controlled because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings, rated AA or higher, assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Companys ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed, limited or lost.
As at 30 September 2009 the Company had an overnight deposit of 7.6 million 2008: 13.5 million with a single counterparty.
There were no other material concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at 30 September 2009 or 30 September 2008 because other deposits were spread over a number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Company maintains sufficient investments in cash and readily realisable securities to pay accounts payable and expenses as they fall due.
Short term flexibility is achieved, where necessary, through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Companys liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers.
