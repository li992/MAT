Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 9 March 2010 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Boards behalf by P J Hill and J C Silver.
Laird PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have been measured at fair value, and accounting for pensions.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill and the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations and defined benefit assets.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 17.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 35.
During the year, the Group adopted IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements.
The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The statement of changes in equity includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented in a reconciliation of each component in equity.
In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present two statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings the Group.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where appropriate.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, plus any costs directly attributable to the combination.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
Laird PLC 53 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 2 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund exists.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Share based payments The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Share Price Improvement Plan SPIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP, SPIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending on its nature.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met.
Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than three years.
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.
54 Laird PLC note 2 Accounting policies continued Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:  where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss:  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and  deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
Interest Interest is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years or less Leasehold buildings 50 years or the lease term if less Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Laird PLC 55 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 2 Accounting policies continued Leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income statement evenly over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Segment reporting During the year, the Group adopted IFRS 8, which replaces IAS 14.
The Group concluded that the operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 are the same business segments previously reported under IAS 14.
Segments are identified on the basis of management information which is presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess the performance of each segment.
Exceptional items These items are presented within the relevant income statement category.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income statement.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where:  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or  the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
56 Laird PLC note 2 Accounting policies continued For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Cash flow hedges These are used to hedge potential changes in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the fair value movement on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Net investment hedges These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses principally administration costs are excluded.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provisions These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
New Standards and Interpretations not applied At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective for the financial period: International Accounting Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IAS 39 Amendment Eligible Hedged Items 1 July 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 1 July 2009 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Laird PLC 57 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 3 Segmental analysis During the year, the Group adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which replaces IAS 14.
Under IFRS 8, segments are identified on the basis of management information which is reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
As a result of adopting IFRS 8, the directors are of the opinion that the primary business segments as reported under IAS 14 should remain unchanged.
The Group will continue to report the following segments: Performance Materials designs and supplies a range of EMI shielding materials, thermal management solutions and signal integrity products to a wide variety of electronic devices.
Handset Products supplies customised, high performance products to mobile phone handset and handheld device manufacturers.
Wireless Systems designs and supplies a range of high specification wireless antennae, and machine-to-machine M2M wireless modules for a number of markets including infrastructure and automotive markets.
Revenue from one customer of the Performance Materials division and Handset Products division represents approximately 190m 2008, 250m of the Groups total revenues.
Unallocated liabilities other in the above table include liabilities for current tax, deferred tax, pensions, dividends, provisions and other creditors.
58 Laird PLC note 3 Segmental analysis continued Geographic information The Group managed its business segments on a global basis and the parent company is resident in the UK.
The Groups operations are based in the following territories: North America, Europe, Asia and Rest of World.
The revenue analysis in the table below is based on the location of the customer.
The analysis of non-current assets is based on the location of the assets and for this purpose consist of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-current assets.

13 Earnings per share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the loss profit for the year divided by the daily average of the number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the same loss profit but with the number of shares increased to reflect the daily average effect of relevant share options granted but not yet exercised where performance conditions have been met and shares contingently issuable.

Comparative figures for weighted average number of shares and earnings per share have been restated after adjusting for the bonus element of the 1 for 2 Rights Issue in 2009.
The adjustment factor is 1.1528 calculated using 166p per share, being the closing price on 29 October 2009.

Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits.
The total amount of research and development activity expensed during 2009 is 42.8m 2008, 39.0m.
There is no indication of impairment for capitalised development costs.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
No indications of impairment to goodwill were identified.
Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of 195.6m at the year end 2008, 216.2m.
Handset Products had a goodwill balance of 137.7m at the year end 2008, 153.6m.
Wireless Systems had a goodwill balance of 117.2m at the year end 2008, 129.8m.
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
For the three divisions, the key assumptions were:  A pre-tax discount rate of 10.5% 2008, 10.0% :  Revenue growth rates for each division were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge.
The discount rate has been applied to cash flow forecasts for 2010 to perpetuity.
Laird has consistently benefited from a low underlying tax charge relative to the UK corporation tax rate of 28% as the Group operates in a number of low tax cost jurisdictions.
This has resulted in a lower discount rate than would otherwise be the case.
A 28% tax rate would have resulted in a discount rate of 11.2%.
The forecast cash flows for 2010 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2010 budget.
Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 2011-2014, have been based on external market estimates for handsets, PCs and Telecoms but after reflecting Managements views of average selling prices, product penetration trends and their impact on the size of the addressable market.
Cash flows for 2015 onwards for all three divisions have been increased by 3% per annum 2008, 3% per annum.
Laird PLC 67 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 17 Intangible assets continued Contingencies have been applied to reduce the cash flows in recognition of the uncertain economic climate.
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash flow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying value of the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required.
Performance Materials has the greatest amount of headroom and Wireless Systems the least.
The latter is a reflection of the impact the downturn in the automotive market had on the division, and even then revenues would have to be some 15% less than forecast for each period before some form of impairment would have to be considered.
Other acquired intangible assets Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets: Brand names 5 years Trade secrets 8 to 15 years Trade marks and names 5 to 15 years Patents the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right Licence the remaining duration of the 20 year legal right Customer relationships 10 years The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period.
Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an indefinite life.
18 Business combinations Acquisition of businesses in 2009 There were no acquisitions in 2009.
Acquisition of businesses in 2008 In February 2008, Ezurio Limited, a UK based supplier of machine to machine solutions for wireless data applications was acquired for a total consideration of 13.7m.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Book and fair values of the net assets of the business acquired were as follows: Fair values Book to the values Group m m Property, plant and equipment 0.1 0.1 Intangible assets 0.1 0.8 Inventories 0.7 0.7 Trade and other receivables 1.0 1.0 Income tax receivable 0.5 0.5 Trade and other payables 1.0 1.0 Deferred tax liabilities 0.2 Net assets acquired 1.4 1.9 Goodwill arising on acquisition 11.8 Consideration 13.7 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration including transaction costs 13.5 Deferred cash consideration 0.5 Net cash acquired 0.3 13.7 The Group has acquired a 100% interest in the acquisition noted above.
Underlying losses before tax for the entity acquired were 1.0m following acquisition.
If the acquisition had been held for the full year, 2008 revenues would have been 0.6m higher, at 635.9m and profit before tax would have been 0.2m lower, at 26.3m.
Details of the Groups significant subsidiaries are disclosed in the list of Principal subsidiaries on page 85.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-90 days terms and are shown net of a provision for impairment.
As at 31 December 2009, trade receivables at nominal value of 2.5m 2008, 3.2m were impaired and fully provided for.
Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 3.2 1.3 Charge for the year 1.2 1.5 Amounts written off 1.1 0.3 Unused amounts reversed 0.5 0.3 Acquired disposed of 0.2 Foreign currency adjustment 0.3 0.8 At 31 December 2.5 3.2 The provision has been based on regular reviews of the collectability of individual customers trade receivable balances.

Notes a There are no borrowings secured on the assets of subsidiary undertakings 2008, nil.
b US Private Placement loans, arising from private placements of debt with US insurance companies, comprise $10m 2008, $10m repayable between 2010 and 2012 at a fixed rate of interest of 7.44% and $140m 2008, $140m repayable between 2014 and 2016 at an average fixed rate of interest of 5.64%.
c The Group had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of 265m which were underwritten in excess of two years.
Drawings by Group companies under these facilities were nil 2008, 75.1m.
Although these drawings are repayable within one year they are classified as long term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the facilities.
d Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility, using the effective interest rate method.

Unrecognised tax losses Deferred tax assets have not been established on trading losses of 14.4m 2008, 16.4m where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date.
Of these losses, 3.6m 2008, 5.1m have expiry dates between 2010 and 2029 and 10.8m 2008, 11.3m are available indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on other deductible temporary differences of 22.4m 2008, 19.1m where their use is restricted indefinitely.
Laird PLC 71 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 25 Deferred taxes continued Temporary differences associated with Group investments Deferred tax of 1.3m 2008, 2.6m has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where it is likely there will be income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences of 29.7m 2008, 152.6m relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the prior year as a result of a change to the UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.

72 Laird PLC note 28 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the notes to the financial statements note 2.

The forward contracts have a principal value of 33.7m 2008, 71.0m and are mainly denominated in US dollar, Indian rupee, Euro and Swedish krona.
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the increase in fair value during 2009 of 2.1m 2008, 2.9m decrease has been taken to the income statement.
Interest rate and currency profile The Groups policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs.
$70m of US Private Placement loans were swapped from fixed to variable interest rates for a five year term, which expired in 2009.
No other interest rate swaps have been entered into during the period so that over 90 per cent of debt is at fixed rate.
This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk The Group holds the majority of its debt at fixed rates since the repayment of its floating rate bilateral loans with the proceeds of the Rights Issue in October 2009.
The following table shows the impact of this on the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The interest rates considered are Sterling and US dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.
Where the Group has taken out fixed to variable interest rate swaps, the impact from changes in interest rates is also included for the purpose of the sensitivity analysis.
Effect on profit before tax m 2009 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 50 basis points increase in sterling interest rates A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
2008 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 0.3 50 basis points increase in sterling interest rates 0.2 A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
Credit risk Lairds customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares.
Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollar, Euro and Renminbi.
The Group policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the residual exposures.
74 Laird PLC note 28 Financial instruments continued The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges.
Effect on profit Effect on before tax equity m m 2009 10% appreciation of the US dollar 6.2 9.7 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.2 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 0.2 2008 10% appreciation of the US dollar 3.6 10.3 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.1 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 0.2 A 10% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $150.0m of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States subsidiaries.
This is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2009 and 2008 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The Groups financial policy is to maintain committed borrowing facilities, which provide substantial headroom over and above its day to day borrowing requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Expiring between two and three years 265.0 Expiring between three and four years 189.9 265.0 189.9 Laird PLC 75 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 28 Financial instruments continued Loan covenants The principal covenants in the Groups committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net borrowings are based on UK GAAP and are set out below: Interest cover The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation EBITA to be not less than 2.5 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2009.
Fair value of financial instruments The US Private Placement loans with a book value of 92.6m 2008, 104.0m have an estimated fair value of 94.4m 2008, 95.2m which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2009.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

On 28 October 2009 the Company announced a 1 for 2 Rights Issue at 100 pence per new share.
The Rights Issue raised 88.8m and Issue expenses were 5.8m.
At 31 December 2009, options to subscribe for 3,418,860 ordinary shares at prices between 140p and 510p were outstanding under the Companys executive share option schemes 2008, 2,642,117 ordinary shares at prices between 140p and 510p, as adjusted for the Rights Issue.

30 Share based payments The Directors remuneration report on pages 40 to 46, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting requirements for the Share Price Improvement Plan SPIP, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan.
Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan RSP vest 3 years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, provided the employee is still employed by the Group.
All share based payments are equity settled.
An expense of 1.6m was recognised in the year 2008, 1.8m before employers national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded, the SPIP shares awarded and the share options granted.
The schemes were amended to take account of the Rights Issue in 2009.
The number of shares outstanding at the date of the Rights Issue were increased by a factor of 1.1528 and the exercise price of any options was adjusted by a factor of 0.8675.
These factors were calculated using 166p, being the closing price on 29 October 2009.
Any historic figures in the tables that follow have been adjusted where necessary by these factors.

The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
31 Reserves Merger reserve On 28 October 2009 the Company announced a 1 for 2 Rights Issue at 100 pence per new share.
It was executed using a structure which created a merger reserve arising under Section 612-3 of Companies Act 2006.
After receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued of 58.0m has been transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings.
Translation reserve The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.

Laird PLC 81 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 note 35 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
12 employees 2008, 14 are members of two different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,700 2008, 1,700 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 0.3m 2008, 1.0m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2009, at their market value, is estimated at 91.4m 2008, 84.3m and the liabilities estimated at 92.7m 2008, 82.0m.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 2.5m 2008, 0.1m asset.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension assets and liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows.

The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates of return from the main asset classes.
For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed.
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
The mortality assumption used at the 2009 year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each members year of birth, subject to a minimum level of future improvement of 1.5%.
Executive and director members have an age rating of -1 years and all other members have an age rating of 2 applied to the base table.
The expected lifetime of a participant who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables: Executive and director Other members members Age Males Females Males Females 65 21.1 24.4 24.0 27.3 65 in 15 years 23.1 26.5 26.1 29.4 The mortality assumption used at the 2008 year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each members year of birth.

The directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date of inception of the company schemes to 31 December 2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to defined benefit schemes will be 0.4m in 2010.
Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Groups proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the scheme.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme.
As a result the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.
