The separate financial statements of the Company are prepared as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The balance sheet of the parent company has also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union EU.
In accordance with the extension permitted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the parent company is not presented as part of these accounts.
The profit after taxation for the year of the parent company was 336.7 million 2008 restated: 66.1 million.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial investments, share options and cash and cash equivalents, which are measured at their fair value.
The accounting policies that are used in preparation of these statements are consistent with the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as set out in those financial statements.
The additional accounting policies that are specific to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries Other financial investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost and are reviewed for impairment when events, or changes in circumstances, indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Restatement of prior year figures Since 2008 the Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk on its net investment in overseas subsidiaries.
In 2008 the Company recorded a revaluation loss of 74.7 million in other reserves in respect of such derivative contracts.
During 2009 it was identified that such revaluation gains or losses, in addition to the previously unrecognised taxation charge or credit, should have been recognised in the Companys profit or loss for the year.
The 2008 comparative figures have therefore been restated in order to report the 74.7 million revaluation loss and the resulting tax credit of 21.3 million in the profit for the financial year.
The effect has been to increase other reserves by 74.7 million, reduce the profit for the year by 53.4 million and increase the current tax asset by 21.3 million.
There is no effect on earlier periods and therefore no restatement of the balance sheet at the beginning of the 2008 comparative period is required.
Employees All Amlin employees within the UK are employed by the Group service company Amlin Corporate Services Limited, and overseas employees are employed by the relevant overseas entities.
Therefore the persons employed by the Company is nil 2008: nil.
