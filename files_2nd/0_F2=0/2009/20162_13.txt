The location and sector experience of these individuals are broadly aligned to 3is international network and the sectors within which it wishes to invest.
The network is a valuable resource for 3i.
Members of the network provide assistance and know-how which help the business line teams identify investment opportunities and perform due diligence.
Members of the BLN may also give 3i access to operational and market expertise.
3i may introduce members of the network to its portfolio companies, and on occasion appoint them to portfolio company boards, where 3i believes their expertise and contacts can add value for the portfolio company and, ultimately, to the value of 3is investment.
Our Business Leaders Network team manages the relationships with members and potential members of the network to ensure that the composition of the network meets 3is business requirements and is aligned to 3is investment strategy.
The composition of the network therefore changes over time.
They also provide advice on recruitment to portfolio company boards, either using the network or working with external executive search agents with whom the team maintains relationships.
Debt Advisory team 3is in-house banking team was formally established in 2005, creating a centre of excellence within 3i for best practice and market knowledge on arranging and managing debt for 3is portfolio companies.
The team also provides an additional source of value by working with the Groups Treasury team who manage the Groups banking relationships.
Investment approach for the year to 31 March 2009 In a market characterised by considerable uncertainty, 3is approach has been to conserve capital, increase the focus on core activities, achieve efficiency gains and prepare the business to take advantage of the investment opportunities which we believe will emerge from the next phase of the cycle.
As a consequence, realisations in the year exceeded new investment by 340 million and the Group invested in only 10 new portfolio companies.
Openness and transparency Building on our reputation for openness and transparency is even more important when markets are more challenging.
Hence we have further increased our disclosure in this report in several key aspects.
Pages 140 to 142 contain more details about our approach to transparency and disclosure as well as how 3i complies with the Walker Guidelines for transparency and disclosure in private equity.
