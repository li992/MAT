Tax on exceptional items is a credit of 7m, all of which relates to current year items.
In 2007 08 tax on exceptional items was a credit of 2m, of which a 14m charge related to current year items and a 16m credit related to prior year items.
Excluding exceptional items the prior year adjustment in 2007 08 was a charge of 5m.
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of 35m was credited directly to equity 2007 08: 19m charge, of which a 37m credit 2007 08: 13m charge results from deferred tax and a 2m charge 2007 08: 6m charge results from current tax.
King sher paid 138m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge.
Proceedings for the recovery of this tax have been initiated and although this may take several years to be resolved, King sher believes that the risk of ultimately being liable for this amount is low.
No asset has been recognised in these financial statements.
In certain circumstances, it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals in the year ended 31 January 2004 could be breached.
Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be signi cant, the Group actively monitors compliance with these conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

The groups of CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed signi cant are the UK and France.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below: Assumptions The cash ow projections are based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development.
Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like LFL sales, margin and operating pro t percentage.
LFL sales are based on the Groups market expectations and the CGUs market shares.
Cash ows beyond this five year period are calculated using a growth rate of 1.9% 2007 08: 1.8% in France, 2.25% elsewhere in the Group which does not exceed the long term average growth rate for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs.
Working capital movements are included in the model, building in anticipated movement due to the level of trading and including reductions across the group as part of the Delivering Value programme over the first three years.
The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash ows, is calculated using a combination of the cost of debt and the cost of equity balanced according to the Groups level of financial gearing.
A risk adjustment is then made for the country in which the CGU operates.
United Kingdom Operating pro ts and operating margin percentages in the strategic plan do not exceed levels previously achieved.
As part of the Delivering Value programme, the B&Q management team plans to grow operating margin from 3.3% in 2007 08 to 7% through a combination of sales density improvements, improved gross margins and lower operating cost ratios.
The risk-adjusted discount rate of 12.0% 2007 08: 10.1% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the UK market.
Based on the value-in-use calculation, the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying amount by 700m.
The Board do not consider that a reasonably possible change would lead to the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount of goodwill based on this level of headroom.
Due to the level of the goodwill allocated to the UK, a sensitivity analysis has been performed with the following results: A decrease in cash ows of 18% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
Five year projections are sensitive to the level and timing of cost reduction initiatives built into the plan.
If operating margins were grown to 7% two years later than in the management plan, the value-in-use of goodwill would equal its carrying amount.
An increase in the discount rate of 1.6% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
A reduction in the growth rate applied beyond year five to a zero growth assumption would still result in the value-in-use of goodwill being signi cantly higher than its carrying amount.
France The risk-adjusted discount rate of 13.4% 2007 08: 10.4% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the French market.
A decrease in cash ows of 26% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
Poland The risk-adjusted discount rate of 13.7% 2007 08: 10.8% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the Polish market.
A decrease in cash ows of 54% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
Italy During the year the Group disposed of Castorama Italy see note 35.
China The risk-adjusted discount rate of 15.9% 2007 08: 13.3% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the Chinese market.
Under IFRS it is not permitted to include the bene ts created by future enhancement capital expenditure.
Due to China undergoing a signi cant restructuring programme in 2009 it was not possible to include a signi cant level of cash ows in the value-in-use calculation.
An impairment loss of 124m has been recognised at the year end relating to all of the goodwill in the China business, which forms part of the Other International reporting segment.
This has arisen due to a weak housing market following a rapid property market slow down, the dependence of the business on new apartment t outs and increasing local competition.

The China impairment losses are included in the Other International reporting segment.
The Group reviews property, plant and equipment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
This is based on value-in-use calculations with the key assumptions being the stores long term plans and the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised in property, plant and equipment in the year was 3m 2007 08: 3m.
The cumulative total of borrowing costs included at the balance sheet date, net of depreciation, was 21m 2007 08: 20m.

All property acquired after 1 February 2004 is carried at cost.
Included in land and buildings is leasehold land that is in effect a prepayment for the use of land and is accordingly being amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
The cost and depreciation of leasehold land included in land and buildings at 31 January 2009 were 344m and 57m 2007 08: 273m and 50m respectively.
The Group does not revalue properties within its financial statements.
A valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes annually in October by independent external valuers covering over one third of the property portfolio with the remaining portfolio valued internally.
Based on this exercise the value of property is 3.2 billion 2007 08: 3.5bn.
The key assumption used in calculating this is the estimated yields.

The exceptional charge has been allocated to the Other International reporting segment and is included within the Groups share of post-tax results.
The charge results from the Groups estimate of the investments recoverable amount, based on the present value of the Groups share of Hornbachs future cash ows.
The Board considers the revised carrying amount of the Hornbach investment to represent its fair value.
The principal assumptions applied are set out below: Cash ow projections are based on the five year strategic plan of Hornbach approved by the Hornbach Board: Key drivers in the plans are sales growth, gross margin and operating pro t margin percentages: Cash ows beyond year five are based on a growth rate of 1.5%: The weighted average cost of capital was based on a pre-tax discount rate of 12.8%: and It is assumed the investment is held in perpetuity.
No goodwill is included in the current year carrying amount of investments in joint ventures and associates.
In the prior year the Group disposed of its 50% interest in B&Q Taiwan resulting in a disposal of investments in joint ventures of 20m.
The prior year share of post-tax results of 19m excludes the 5m loss on disposal.

No MTNs or other xed term debt were repaid during the year.
The US Private Placement contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating pro t to net finance costs, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period.
The Group complied with this covenant for the year ended 31 January 2009 and prior years.
Finance lease commitments The Group leases certain of its buildings and xtures and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term maturity for buildings is seven years 2007 08: eight years and for xtures and equipment is two years 2007 08: two years.
Certain building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.

Fair value of borrowings The fair values of current borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair value of non-current borrowings.
Where market values are not available or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

At 31 January 2009 net derivative assets included in net debt amounted to 135m 2007 08: 23m.
Fair value hedges Interest rate swap contracts convert xed rate debt issued under the Groups MTN programme and the US Private Placement to oating rate liabilities.
At 31 January 2009 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts was 1,391m 2007 08: 1,202m.
At 2 February 2008 the Group held in ation swaps to hedge in ation rate exposures in certain property lease contracts, which have been settled during the year.
At 31 January 2009 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts was nil 2007 08: 10m.
Cash ow hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases.
At 31 January 2009 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts was 181m 2007 08: 172m.
The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months.
Gains of 10m 2007 08: 8m losses have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year.
Swap contracts to hedge the cost of diesel oil for use in the business have been entered into during the year.
At 31 January 2009 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts was 4m 2007 08: nil.
The gains and losses on these contracts will be transferred to the income statement over the next 12 months.
Net investment hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments.
At 31 January 2009 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts was 373m 2007 08: 343m.
Non-designated hedges The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against uctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions.
At 31 January 2009 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts was 830m 2007 08: 609m.
These have not been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet positions.
These include forward foreign exchange instruments hedging part of the funding of the Groups overseas operations, a cross-currency swap converting a Euro-denominated debt into a Sterling liability, an interest rate swap converting oating rate debt to xed rates, and short term foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.
The Group has reviewed all signi cant contracts for embedded derivatives.
None of these contracts has any embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately.

The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves Treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage these risks.
King sher Treasury is not run as a pro t centre and it does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives.
The main types of financial instruments used are Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk Borrowings arranged at oating rates of interest expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at xed rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Groups underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt.
King shers policy is to manage the currency and interest rate pro le of its issued debt using derivative contracts.
The effect of these contracts on the Groups net debt was as follows: Sterling Euro US Dollar Other millions Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Total At 31 January 2009 Net debt before fair value adjustments and nancing derivatives 438 313 977 472 321 42 137 13 1,033 Fair value adjustments to net debt 7 42 57 106 Financing derivatives 400 1,053 667 469 324 121 145 135 Net debt 38 747 310 39 3 106 137 158 1,004 At 2 February 2008 Net debt before fair value adjustments and nancing derivatives 443 92 820 14 262 47 83 72 1,567 Fair value adjustments to net debt 3 14 26 15 Financing derivatives 401 626 547 561 262 23 Net debt 42 721 273 533 21 83 72 1,559 Currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi.
The Euro and Zloty exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Ireland and Poland.
Balance sheet Euro translation exposure is substantially hedged by maintaining a proportion of the Groups debt in Euro.
In Chinese Renminbi, balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China and partly by forward foreign exchange contracts entered into to hedge this exposure.
However, it is the Groups policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings primarily Euro into Sterling.
In addition, the Group has signi cant transaction exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the signi cant market risks impacting King sher, are borrowings, deposits and derivatives.
The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of net finance costs, net debt and derivative cash ow hedges to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
2008 09 2007 08 Net finance Net finance costs costs Income Income millions costs costs Effect of 1% rise in interest rates on net finance costs Sterling 7 7 Euro 5 US Dollar 1 1 Polish Zloty 1 1 Chinese Renminbi 1 1 KF6878 Back v03d 170409. indd KF6878 Back v03d 170409. indd 76 76 18 4 09 18 4 09 10:02:08 10:02:08 King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 77 2008 09 2008 09 2007 08 Net debt Net debt Increase Increase millions decrease decrease Effect of 10% appreciation in exchange rates on net debt Euro against Sterling 35 81 US Dollar against Sterling 11 2 Polish Zloty against Sterling 15 8 Chinese Renminbi against Sterling 14 9 The impact of changes in exchange rates on net debt results principally from the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Such changes in net debt result in gains and losses being reported in equity and will be offset by the retranslation of the hedged net investments.
Where US Dollars are purchased on receipt of inventories in order to match the settlement of US Dollar payables, gains and losses on retranslation of the US Dollars are reported in the income statement and offset the losses and gains on retranslation of the payables.
2008 09 2007 08 Derivative Derivative cash ow cash ow hedges hedges Increase Increase millions decrease decrease Effect of 10% appreciation in exchange rates on derivative cash ow hedges US Dollar against Sterling 12 12 US Dollar against Euro 6 6 The impact of changes in exchange rates on cash ow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars used to hedge forecast US Dollar purchases of inventories.
The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur.
See note 24 for further details.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax.
It has been prepared on the basis that the Groups debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts remain constant, re ecting the positions at 31 January 2009 and 2 February 2008 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
In preparing the sensitivity analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and exchange rates.
Liquidity risk The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities.
This involves preparing a prudent cash ow forecast for the next three years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected out ows.
The following table analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

A credit limit for each counterparty is agreed by the Board covering the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts.
The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the investments and derivative contracts across several counterparties.
At 31 January 2009, the highest cash deposit with a single bank or money market fund was 89m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short term deposits and the fair value of derivative assets.
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a low concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables.
Concentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual balances with short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated customers.
At 31 January 2009, trade and other receivables that were past due but not provided against amounted to 20m 2007 08: 19m, of which 1m 2007 08: 3m were over 120 days past due.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 214m 2007 08: 159m due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China of 170m 2007 08: 73m which can only be carried forward in the next one to five years and tax losses arising in Spain of 36m 2007 08: 24m which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years.
Other losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

The provisions are based on the present value of future cash out ows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK and China restructuring programmes.
The charge to the income statement includes 19m related to the termination of leases in China.
The provisions have been discounted to re ect the time value of money and the risks associated with the speci c liabilities.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash ows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and subletting surplus space.
28 Post employment bene ts The Group operates a variety of post employment bene t arrangements covering both funded and unfunded fide ned bene t schemes and funded fide ned contribution schemes.
The most signi cant are the funded, final salary fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees.
Various fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes are operated in France and Poland, where they are retirement indemnity in nature, and in China.
The overseas schemes are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
fide ned contribution schemes Pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes, at rates speci ed in the individual schemes rules, are as follows: millions 2008 09 2007 08 Charge to operating pro t 6 5 fide ned bene t schemes The Groups principal fide ned bene t pension scheme is in the UK.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes bene ciaries.
The UK scheme was closed to new entrants in 2004.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the scheme Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2007.
The Company monitors the scheme funding level on a regular basis and will review with the scheme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups fide ned bene t pension schemes are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to signi cant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis.
The UK scheme discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets re ects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the schemes.

The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PA 92 tables projected forward to 2007 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa.
These improvements have been set with regard to trends observed within the scheme over the past decade.
The assumptions for life expectancy of UK scheme members are as follows: Years 2008 09 2007 08 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 87.2 87.2 Female 85.9 85.9 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 88.8 88.8 Female 87.1 87.1 The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the estimated impact on obligations resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.

Since grants under the KISS are made following the year end to which the first year of charge relates, it is not possible to give the number of options granted until after the year end.
This also applies to grants that will be made following the year end relating to store manager incentive schemes.
2 The weighted average exercise price for options granted during the period represents a blend of nil price KISS, Performance Share Plan and Retention Plan options and discounted ShareSave options see below.
Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the period.
On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, rather than at the date of exercise, was 1.27 2007 08: 2.11.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise prices ranging from nil to 2.45 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.0 years 2007 08: 2.2 years.
The Group recognised a total expense of 15m in the year 2007 08: 6m relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the Group recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002.
Option numbers and other disclosures above are for those options granted after this date.
