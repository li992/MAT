The Groups investment in ITV is carried at fair value.
The fair value of ITV is determined with reference to its equity share price at the balance sheet date.
An impairment was first recorded following a review of the carrying value of the investment in ITV at 31 December 2007, due to the significant and prolonged decline in the equity share price.
In accordance with IFRS, the Group has continued to review that carrying value throughout scal 2008 and scal 2009 and has recognised an impairment loss of 191 million in the current year 2008: 616 million.
The impairment loss for the year was determined with reference to ITVs closing equity share price of 20.0 pence at 27 March 2009, the last trading day of the Groups third scal quarter.
In line with IFRS, all subsequent increases in the fair value of the ITV investment above this impaired value have been recorded in the available-for-sale reserve.
At 26 June 2009, the last trading day of the Groups financial year, ITVs closing equity share price was 33.8 pence.
Any disposal of the investment, assuming certain other factors remain consistent with those existing at the balance sheet date, would be exempt from tax under the provisions of the Substantial Shareholding Exemption SSE.
As such, the SSE provisions would prevent any capital loss arising for tax purposes.
The Group holds certain unquoted equity investments that are carried at cost less impairment.
The fair value of these investments is not considered to differ signicantly from their carrying value.
