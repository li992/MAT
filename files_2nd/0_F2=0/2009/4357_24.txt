Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009 Notes to the financial statements 61 1 Segmental information The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products produced.
The Group is segmented into two divisions, Foods and Dairies, according to the nature of the products sold and markets serviced.
The Foods segment comprises predominantly branded cheese and spreads sold via the multiples.
It includes both the UK Spreads business and the St Hubert business acquired in January 2007 since both supply similar product to similar markets using the same production and distribution methods.
The Dairies segment comprises predominantly liquid milk sales via the multiples, middle ground or doorstep.
The Household business is included within the Dairies segment as its operations are mutually interdependent with the liquid milk business.
All revenue is derived from the sale of goods.
Inter-segment sales of cream from Dairies to Foods amounted to 41.0 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 2008: 42.6 million.
Transfer prices are based on delivered cost to the Group.
The Groups geographical segments are based on the location of the Groups assets.
The Group has two geographical segments being UK and Ireland and Rest of world.
The Wexford business, based in Ireland, generates the majority of its revenue from sales into the UK and operates under similar economic and political conditions to the UK.
As a result, the UK and Ireland businesses have been combined into one geographical segment.
Sales to Rest of world disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of customers.
The Rest of world category comprises the St Hubert business and ingredients and nished goods exports from the UK.

These costs comprise the closure of the Nottingham dairy processing plant and associated distribution network restructuring costs.
Cash costs comprise 5.1 million and relate principally to redundancy and related expenditure.
Furthermore there was a non-cash asset impairment of 1.7 million for plant and equipment and 0.4 million for intangible assets.
In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group closed its dairy at Totnes.
This resulted in exceptional costs of 4.8 million including impairment of property, plant and equipment.
Since that time the land and buildings at Totnes have been held at fair value less costs to sell.
In the year ended 31 March 2009, there have been signi cant delays in the planning process for the sale of this land at Totnes and any sale is now likely to take several years.
Additionally, during this time the property market has weakened substantially.
These factors have led to a further impairment of 1.5 million against the carrying value of Totnes assets to a level that re ects managements best estimate of the revised fair value less costs to sell and a further 0.5 million cash costs relating to the site that will now not be recovered through disposal proceeds.
In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group provided 4.4 million for an onerous long-term milk supply contract.
The contract had become onerous as a result of unprecedented increases in milk prices during 2007 08.
A combination of higher milk costs in the first half of 2008 09 and a negotiation with the customer that was longer than expected have resulted in a further charge of 1.0 million being required in the year ended 31 March 2009.
This comprises 0.9 million for onerous cash out ows to the expected renegotiation date of which 0.4 million was utilised in the year ended 31 March 2009 and a further 0.1 million for impairment of plant and equipment that is expected to form part of the negotiated settlement with the customer this is a non-cash charge.
From the first half of 2009 10, this contract is no longer expected to be onerous to the Group.
Foods In October 2006 the Group sold its retailer brand cheese business to First Milk Limited.
This included the cheese cutting and packing facility at Maelor.
First Milk Limited have continued to cut and pack cheese since that time under a three year transitional service agreement.
Signi cant capital investment was undertaken during 2008 to build a modern, ef cient cheese cutting and packing facility at our national distribution centre at Nuneaton.
In the period from January 2009 to July 2009 volumes are being transferred from Maelor to Nuneaton as the latter gradually increases processing volumes.
During this ramp up phase, there are duplicate running costs resulting from cutting and packing at two separate sites and inef ciencies at Nuneaton due to low initial volumes.
These duplicate running costs amounted to 3.7 million in the year to 31 March 2009, of which 3.6 million were cash.
A further 1.0 million is expected to be incurred in the first half of 2009 10.
On 23 August 2008, the Group disposed of the property, plant and equipment and the inventories of its Stilton and speciality cheese business based in Hartington, Derbyshire to Long Clawson Dairy Limited.
The results of this business have not been classi ed as discontinued operations since it is not considered a major line of business in the context of Group revenue and pro t. 0982 0982 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1065 65 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1065 65 1 6 09 1 6 09 16:28:58 16:28:58 The numbers Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009 66 Notes to the financial statements continued 4 Exceptional items continued The loss on disposal amounted to 4.5 million and comprises: m Sales proceeds cash consideration 3.8 Book value of property, plant and equipment disposed 4.4 Book value of intangible assets disposed 0.4 Book value of inventories disposed 3.3 Other fees and costs 0.7 Loss on disposal 5.0 Associated pension curtailment gain 0.5 Exceptional charge before tax 4.5 An impairment of 5.6 million has been charged against the carrying value of plant and equipment at our cheese manufacturing plant in Wexford, Ireland.
The pro tability and cash generation of this business was adversely impacted in the year ended 31 March 2009 as realisations for commodity cheese declined.
Following a review for possible impairment, these assets have been written down to their fair value less costs to sell based on managements best view as to their current market value.
On 26 March 2009, the Group sold its 49% share in Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited YDC to Yoplait SAS, the majority owner, for cash consideration of 63.5 million.
The YDC joint venture had been accounted for using the equity method up to the date of its disposal.
The results of this business have not been classi ed as discontinued operations since it was not considered a major line of business or geographical area of operations.
The pro t on disposal amounted to 50.4 million and can be analysed as follows: m Sales proceeds cash consideration 63.5 Group share of YDC net assets at date of disposal 8.6 Provision for cost of insuring YDC fide ned bene t pension scheme liabilities see Note 24 3.5 Other fees and costs 1.0 Gain on disposal 50.4 Tax The cessation of IBAs was enacted during the year ended 31 March 2009.
Under IFRS the Group has charged an increased deferred tax provision in respect of IBAs as the tax written down value has decreased signi cantly.
This provision has been charged as exceptional due to its one-off nature and material size.
The provision will unwind in future periods offsetting the cash impact of the cessation of IBAs on the Groups effective tax rate.
2008 Exceptional items in 2007 08 comprised: 4.8 million charge in relation to the closure of a dairy at Totnes.
This charge included cash costs of 3.1 million principally in respect of redundancies 2.0 million and a non-cash asset impairment of 1.7 million for plant and equipment.
8.6 million cash charge of restructuring expenditure with respect to the rationalisation of the Express Dairies depot operations and the Liverpool and Nottingham dairies of Arla Foods UK Limited, which were acquired on 19 August 2006.
These restructuring costs comprised 3.1 million of redundancy costs, 3.5 million of duplicate running costs and 2.0 million of other rationalisation costs.
10.0 million charge for penalties and associated legal fees in relation to settlement of the OFT investigation into milk price initiatives.
On 20 September 2007 the Of ce of Fair Trading OFT issued a detailed Statement of Objections to certain retailers and dairy processors in its investigation into pricing in the dairy produce sector.
On 7 December the Group announced that it had reached an early resolution agreement with the OFT concerning this investigation.
Under this agreement the Group expects to pay a signi cantly reduced ne of 9.4 million.
In addition, legal fees of 0.6 million have been charged in relation to the investigation.
The exceptional cost has been allocated 3.6 million Foods and 6.4 million Dairies.
Cash costs incurred in the year ended 31 March 2008 amounted to 0.4 million of legal fees.
4.4 million provision for an onerous long-term milk supply contract.
This contract became onerous during the year ended 31 March 2008 as a result of unprecedented increases in milk costs combined with weaker cream prices in the second half.
The provision comprised the present value of estimated cash out ows under this contract through to its term as estimated in March 2008.
Cash utilisation of this provision in the year to 31 March 2008 was 1.5 million.
6.7 million pro t on a site in west London originally sold in October 2002.
The site was sold with a potential future overage receipt from the purchasers should certain planning permissions be obtained.
A cash amount of 6.7 million was received in the period in full and final settlement of this overage clause.
1.2 million final tax adjustment on the disposal of the majority of our retailer branded cheese business to First Milk in October 2006.

9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS on pro t for the year is calculated by dividing pro t attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Basic EPS on continuing operations is calculated on the basis of Group pro t for the year from continuing operations less pro t attributable to minority interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the pro t attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

This resulted in an impairment of 1.7 million to property, plant and equipment.
Following the closure of the Totnes dairy in the year ended 31 March 2008, planning delays and a weakening UK property market have resulted in a reduced fair value less costs to sell at 31 March 2009 compared to March 2008.
This resulted in a further impairment of 1.5 million to property, plant and equipment.

The Speciality Cheese CGU was disposed of in August 2008 see Note 30.
All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 9.5% for UK Spreads and Cheese 2008: 8.4%, 9.9% for St Hubert 2008: 9.1% and 9.8% for Dairies 2008: 8.4%.
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model.
Discount rates have increased compared to March 2008 as a result of the global financial market uncertainty and resultant increase in the equity risk premium.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese is 2.0% pa being the estimated UK and Euro zone long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks 2008: 2.0%.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the three-year period for the Dairies CGU is 0% 2008: 0%.
Management considers this a cautious assumption in the light of current opportunities in the enlarged Household business and ongoing improvements in the Dairy manufacturing and distribution networks but recognise the historical doorstep decline rates experienced in the doorstep milk business.
0982 0982 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1074 74 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1074 74 29 5 09 29 5 09 17:08:53 17:08:53 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009 75 12 Goodwill continued The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2009 is: Dairies 68.9 million 2008: 68.6 million UK Spreads 65.5 million 2008: 65.5 million St Hubert 206.2 million 2008: 177.6 million Cheese 2.1 million 2008: 2.1 million The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated ef ciency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates re ect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to re ect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year time frame.
For the Household business within Dairies, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
In addition, the value in use calculation for the Group comprising each CGUs value in use is compared to the Group market capitalisation at the date of impairment testing and 31 March each year.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of the Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount with the exception, in the cases of St Hubert and Cheese, of the discount rate used in the value in use calculation which is outside managements control.
Should the discount rate used for calculating the St Hubert value in use rise to 11.2% and the discount rate used for calculating the Cheese value in use rise to 12.3% due to external financial market uncertainties then the carrying value would exceed that units recoverable amount.
The impairment headroom for the St Hubert and Cheese CGUs is 47 million and 63.1 million respectively.
For the Dairies CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumption is future growth rates.
Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should any decline in the Dairies CGU be greater than 3% per annum beyond year three then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
The impairment headroom for the Dairies CGU is 74.6 million.

These costs will be amortised over seven years.
Certain internally generated intangible assets that were in the course of construction at 31 March 2008 were included within plant and equipment for that year.
The classi cation of those assets into intangibles has been re ected in the year ended 31 March 2009 and not as a prior year adjustment as the amount is immaterial in the context of the overall carrying value of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets.
2008 On 17 February 2008 the Group acquired certain assets from the East of England Co-operative Society.
This included two customer contracts that have been recognised as intangible assets 2.0 million.
These contracts will be amortised over four years.
During 2008 certain adjustments were made to the fair value of intangible assets acquired with St Hubert SAS in January 2007.
These total 0.6 million and are analysed in Note 30.

This investment was sold on 26 March 2009 see Note 4.
At 31 March 2009, the only investment in a joint venture was the 50% interest in Fayre eld-Foodtec Limited, a company manufacturing specialist dairy ingredients and powders.
The share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of joint ventures at 31 March and for the years then ended, which are equity accounted for in the consolidated financial statements, are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Current assets 2.3 21.0 Non-current assets 1.1 1.7 3.4 22.7 Current liabilities 0.5 17.4 Non-current liabilities 0.5 17.4 Share of net assets 2.9 5.3 Revenue 70.3 66.9 Operating costs 60.3 56.0 Finance income 0.1 0.1 Pro t before tax 10.1 11.0 Tax expense 2.8 3.3 Share of net pro t 7.3 7.7 Analysis of share of net pro t: Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited 7.1 7.4 Other 0.2 0.3 The exceptional pro t on disposal of Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited is analysed in Note 4.
On 6 December 2007, the Group acquired a 50% interest in the ordinary share capital of Fayre eld-Foodtec Limited for a consideration of 2.1 million.
On completion, both put and call options were put in place for the remaining 50% of Fayre eld-Foodtec Limited which are exercisable from 6 June 2009 to 6 July 2009, by the other joint venture party or the Group respectively.
Exercise of these options will result in the Group acquiring the remaining 50% based on a multiple of earnings subject to a oor and cap.
The combination of call and put options makes acquisition of the remaining 50% by the Group highly probable, however until exercise of the options the Group does not exercise control.
Therefore the investment in Fayre eld-Foodtec Limited is accounted for using the equity method.
The option to acquire the remaining 50% of Fayre eld-Foodtec Limited had an initial fair value of nil and had an immaterial fair value at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008.
The share of assets and goodwill acquired in December 2007 can be analysed as follows: Book and fair value m Property, plant and equipment 0.4 Working capital 1.0 Goodwill 0.7 Consideration 2.1 Analysed: Cash consideration 2.0 Fees 0.1 2.1 On 23 October 2007 the Group sold its 50% investment in Cotteswold Dairy Limited for cash consideration of 3.0 million.
Until 30 September 2007 this investment had been disclosed as an investment in joint venture using the equity method.
At this date the carrying value was impaired by 0.6 million to 3.0 million see Note 3.

The Dairy Crest Group pension fund is a final salary scheme that was closed to new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date are invited to join a Dairy Crest Group fide ned contribution plan.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007 by the funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
The following tables summarise the components of net bene t expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the fide ned bene t plans.
These plans are wholly funded.

This contract is included within scheme assets and its value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered.
This will reduce the volatility of the reported fide ned bene t obligations in future periods.
At 31 March 2008, recognition of the net fide ned bene t surplus was not restricted by the implementation of IFRIC 14 see Accounting Policies note.

The expected rate of return on equities of 8.25% 2008: 8% re ects historic UK equity returns with an assumption for 2009 that unprecedented equity market falls in 2008 09 will give rise to marginally higher market returns in the medium term.
They represent a reasonable risk premium over gilts.
It is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 7.1% 2008: 6.1% is based upon the gross redemption yield available on a similar pro le of gilts and corporate bonds.
The average duration of scheme liabilities is approximately 19 years.
Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon quoted AA-rated corporate bond indexes, excluding collateralised bonds, with maturities matching the schemes expected bene t payments.
In ation assumptions are based upon the difference between long-term xed income and index linked gilt yields.
The scheme fide cit is highly dependent upon these input assumptions which are struck at 31 March each year.
A 0.1% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 12 million.
Included in the above analysis is the Wexford Creamery pension fund.
The net bene t expense in the year ended 31 March 2009 amounted to 0.5 million 2008: 0.4 million.
The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2009 was 7.8 million 2008: 8.6 million and the fide ned bene t obligation was 11.1 million 2008: 10.6 million resulting in a scheme fide cit of 3.3 million 2008: 2.0 million.

Additionally, in the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008 the Group paid an additional 12 million per annum as additional cash contributions.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme fide cit recognised on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income and expense in relation to the Group pension plans.
The legal sponsor of the Dairy Crest Group pension plan is Dairy Crest Limited.
The Group has charged 1.3 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group fide ned contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2009 2008: 0.7 million.
The Company has charged 0.1 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group fide ned contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2009 2008: 0.1 million.

The amount of the ne provided is 9.4 million and re ects the early resolution agreement that was reached with the OFT in December 2007.
This ne represents a signi cant reduction to the amount that could have been imposed by the OFT and is dependent upon the Groups continued full co-operation with the OFT until the conclusion of its investigation.
The possibility of the imposition of a higher ne by the OFT is considered remote given the Groups continuing co-operation in this matter.
Settlement is expected to be reached in the year ending 31 March 2010 and the related provision has been classi ed as current.
Onerous contract The Group has one milk supply contract with a middle ground customer which, due to unprecedented increases in milk costs in 2007 08 and a subsequent weakening of cream prices, become onerous.
An exceptional provision of 4.4 million was charged in the year ended 31 March 2008, being the best estimate at the time of the present value of future cash out ows resulting from the contractual obligations in the contract see Note 4.
In that year, 1.5 million was charged against this provision.
In the year ended 31 March 2009, there were further milk cost increases and contract negotiations took longer than anticipated.
This onerous contract is now expected to be renegotiated in the first half of 2009 10 and a further provision of 0.9 million has been charged for expected cash out ows under this contract until its expected renegotiation date.
In calculating the amount of cash out ows to the end of this contract, estimates have been made regarding future pricing and volumes.

On completion of the disposal, 3.5 million was charged as a provision for the cost of the insurance and funds were deposited in escrow for the bene t of the YDC scheme trustee.
This amount was the best estimate at the date of disposal of the cost of buying out the scheme liabilities.
This has been accounted for as a provision under IAS 37 and not under IAS 19 as there ceased to be a fide ned bene t scheme on completion of the disposal.
Inevitably, the final cost of insurance is dependent upon bond yields and other factors.
Managements best view, based on current financial market conditions, is that the final cost could be below 3.5 million and that the Group might recover some of the funds placed into escrow.
This contingent asset has not been recognised since receipt is not virtually certain and therefore does not meet the recognition criteria under IAS 37.

The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in earnings per share or, from August 2006, economic pro t. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years.
On 1 July 2008 1,161,635 options were granted under the LTISP scheme July 2007: 563,314.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
In December 2007 1,340,664 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave scheme at a grant price of 487 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2009.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Companys shares could be exercised up to 2012 but all outstanding options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2007.
No options have been granted under this scheme since 22 July 2002.
There were no cash settlement alternatives.
In addition, from 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares is charged over four years being the year the bonus related to and the three year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at date of issue.
There is no bonus payout for the year ended 31 March 2009 and therefore will be no deferred shares issued 2008: 2,931 shares.
The number of share options and weighted average exercise price for each of the schemes is set out as follows: LTISP ESOS Sharesave Scheme Weighted average Weighted average exercise price exercise price Number Number pence Number pence Options outstanding at 1 April 2008 1,566,117 2,450,009 441.4 Options granted during the year 1,161,635 Reinvested dividends 159,046 Options exercised during the year 450,419 9,231 388.0 Options forfeited during the year 682,158 1,463,989 411.3 Options outstanding at 31 March 2009 1,754,221 976,789 487.0 Exercisable at 31 March 2009 350,250 Options outstanding at 1 April 2007 1,367,092 1,384,082 387.1 Options granted during the year 563,314 1,340,664 487.0 Reinvested dividends 56,730 Options exercised during the year 248,467 105,681 377.9 Options forfeited during the year 172,552 169,056 398.2 Options outstanding at 31 March 2008 1,566,117 2,450,009 441.4 Exercisable at 31 March 2008 479,313 The weighted average exercise price for LTISP options is nil.
At 31 March 2009 no ESOS share options were outstanding 31 March 2008: nil.
Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to September 2011 at a price of 487p 31 March 2008: exercisable up to September 2011 at prices ranging from 388p to 487p.
LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2018 March 2008: July 2017.
The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2009 is 8.52 years for the LTISP and 2.42 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2008: 8.19 years and 2.50 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 3.88 2008: 6.90 and on exercise of Sharesave options was not applicable as none was exercised 2008: 6.49.

This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The number of share options granted has been adjusted for forfeitures in the period to 31 March 2009.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2007 grant were: expected share price volatility 28.3%, risk free rate of interest 4.15% and dividend yield 4.57%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2009.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in July 2008 is 44% for the TSR element and 100% for the Economic Pro t element July 2007: 59% TSR and 100% Economic Pro t giving a fair value of 2.37 per option granted 2008: 5.43.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on economic pro t and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
There is no reasonable likelihood of the economic pro t condition on the 2007 and 2008 LTISP issues being met and no charge has been assumed for this element.
A 100% charge has been assumed on the 2006 LTISP economic pro t measure.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2009 were as follows: Term 3 years 2008: 3 years Volatility 32% 2008: 24% Risk free rate 5.2% 2008: 5.1% Average volatility of comparator TSR 33% 2008: 24% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 11% 2008: 8% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2009 is 0.8 million 2008: 3.2 million See Note 10.

During the year, the Company sold its receivable under a convertible loan to a subsidiary undertaking at fair value for cash consideration.
Additionally, the Company subscribed for 228.9 million ordinary shares of 1 each in Dairy Crest UK Limited, a subsidiary, for cash consideration.
30 Business combinations 2009 During the year, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled milk buyers for cash consideration of 0.3 million resulting in goodwill of 0.3 million.
In April 2008, final consideration was paid for the assets and goodwill of the dairy business of the East of England Co-operative Society amounting to 1.0 million.
In August 2008, the Group completed the sale of its Stilton and speciality cheese business to Long Clawson Dairy Limited.
The loss on disposal is analysed in Note 4.
On 26 March 2009, the Group completed the sale of its 49% share in Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited to Yoplait SAS.
The pro t on disposal is analysed in Note 4.
2008 On 17 February 2008, the Group acquired the assets and goodwill of the dairy business of the East of England Co-operative Society for an initial consideration of 4 million.
The provisional fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities of the business at the date of acquisition was as follows: Fair value Book to Group value m m Property, plant and equipment 0.4 0.5 Intangible assets 2.0 Deferred tax 0.7 Inventories 0.2 0.2 Receivables 0.9 0.9 Payables 0.1 0.1 Net assets 2.7 1.5 Goodwill 2.6 Consideration 5.3 Comprising: Cash consideration 4.0 Deferred working capital consideration adjustment 1.0 Professional fees 0.3 0982 0982 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1092 92 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1092 92 29 5 09 29 5 09 17:08:58 17:08:58 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009 93 30 Business combinations continued Provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities of these depots were used to calculate goodwill due to the proximity of the acquisition to 31 March 2008.
Final valuation took place during the period to 17 February 2009 and did not result in any further fair value adjustments.
Fair value adjustments principally comprise the recognition of two supply contracts as intangible assets along with the related deferred tax liabilities.
During 2008, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled milk buyers for cash consideration of 1.6 million resulting in goodwill of 1.6 million.
Included in goodwill for the above acquisitions are certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identi ed and measured due to their nature.
These include acquired milk rounds lists and assembled workforces.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
The majority of the value was assessed to comprise synergy bene ts expected to be achieved by merging the businesses acquired into the Groups existing operations.
The trade and assets acquired as a result of the above acquisitions were absorbed into the wider Dairies business within Dairy Crest Limited.
As a result, disclosure of the pro t for the year to 31 March is impracticable.
Similarly, it is impracticable to disclose what Group pro t and revenue from continuing operations would have been if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2007.
Certain fair value adjustments were made in relation to St Hubert in the period to December 2007.
These comprised adjustments to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax and resulted in additional goodwill of 0.6 million being recognised.
31 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported pro tability and on cash ows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2009 and 2008, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that forecast net borrowings, plus a reasonable operating headroom, are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20.
At 31 March 2009 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 669 million 2008: 632 million excluding finance leases of 14 million 2008: 16 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on $US and loan notes of 32.1 million 2008: 15.8 million.
The facilities consist of: 2009 a 85 million plus 175 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in July 2013: a 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011: Loan notes totalling 321 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
2008 a term loan of 25 million repayable in semi-annual instalments in June 2008 20 million and December 2008 5 million : a 250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in June 2009: a 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011: Loan notes totalling 257 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2009 amounted to 127 million 2008: 150 million.
This can be analysed as follows see also Note 20 : 0982 0982 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1093 93 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1093 93 29 5 09 29 5 09 19:12:30 19:12:30 The numbers Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009 94 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 2009 2009 2008 2008 Drawn down Facility Drawn down Facility m m m m June 2004 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 93.1 250.0 November 2006 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 100.0 100.0 106.7 100.0 July 2008 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 120.1 247.1 Total 220.1 347.1 199.8 350.0 Headroom 127.0 150.2 Cash and short term deposits 107.5 40.3 Effective headroom 234.5 190.5 The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a oating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
Speci cally, to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at xed rates of interest.
To manage this mix in a cost-ef cient manner, the Group has issued xed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its oating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at speci ed intervals, the difference between xed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash ow obligations.
At 31 March 2009, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 73% of the Groups borrowings were at a xed rate of interest 2008: 67%.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 32.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing to some extent in the same functional currency as the foreign operation into which it invests.
The foreign operations hedged in this way are St Hubert SAS France and Wexford Creamery Limited Ireland : both are Euro-denominated subsidiaries.
Our policy changed during the year ended 31 March 2009.
Previously, 100% of overseas net assets were hedged but this proportion has been reduced in line with the Groups reduced levels of Euro-denominated borrowings.
Our new policy is to hedge 100% of the inventories and tangible xed assets and 33% of goodwill and intangible assets exposure 2008: 100% of net assets of these subsidiaries through borrowings and or cross-currency swaps in Euros.
No hedging of earnings exposure is undertaken.
At present, our only currency exposure is Euros.
At 31 March 2009, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge are done so on a pre-tax basis and no cross currency swaps are utilised as part of the hedging relationship.
For part of the year ended 31 March 2008, cross-currency swaps were used as part of the designated hedge relationship and this and an element of Euro-denominated borrowings were designated as a post-tax hedge of the St Hubert net investment.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
This can be seen in Note 17 where the only signi cant non-Sterling debtors are in Euros and these predominantly relate to the functional currency of St Hubert and Wexford.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be xed.
There are currently no sales between the UK business and St Hubert SAS.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.

At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash ows.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no pro t and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as any retranslation impact on the pro t and loss account is offset by recycling of amounts from the SORIE.
In 2009, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps on 75 million of its loan notes denominated in Euros in order to hedge the future interest and principal repayment cash ows.
There is no pro t and loss exposure in relation to this 75 million of debt as any retranslation impact on the pro t and loss account is offset by recycling of amounts from the SORIE.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil HFO and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on pro tability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
Vegetable oil contracts are usually structured such that between six and nine months purchases are at xed prices.
Energy is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
Diesel and HFO is not generally contracted at xed prices although from time to time, forward contracts have been put in place to x future prices.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Executive Directors.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit veri cation procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not signi cant.
The Household doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly where payment terms have been breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 279.6 million 2008: 219.7 million.
There are no signi cant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No signi cant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2009 or 2008 and there have been no changes in the objectives, policies and procedures during the last two years.

The fide nition of net debt is included in Note 34.
The gearing ratio at March 2009 and 2008 can be analysed as follows: 2009 2008 m m Net debt 415.8 474.8 Shareholders funds 357.0 387.7 Gearing ratio 116% 122% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy is to maintain a stable dividend policy whilst maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover.
Total dividends paid and proposed in the year ended 31 March 2009 of 20.1 pence represents a decrease of 17.6% 2008: 24.4 pence and 6.6% growth.
32 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies is set out in the discussion of Treasury policies in Note 31.

There is no impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash ow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative xed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative oating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash ow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative oating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge are matched in both pro t and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative xed rate financial instruments have pro t and loss exposure due to oating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2009 analysis below re ects a larger reasonably possible upside change in interest rates than in 2008 due to the current exceptionally low LIBOR levels and likelihood of future in ation.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was 74 million 69 million 2008: 74 million 59 million.
Interest rate swaps are designated as cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The oating rate of interest on the receipt leg of these swaps is EURIBOR 2008: EURIBOR.
The hedged item is the interest cash ows on 74 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facilities at oating EURIBOR the margin is not hedged.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next three years being the life of the swap 2008: four years.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding USD GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was $233 million 133 million 2008: $233 million, 133 million.
These cross currency swaps have both legs at xed interest rates, are designated as cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2009 and 2008 the xed interest rates vary from 5.305% to 5.315%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next four to seven years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was 75 million 67 million 2008: None.
At 31 March 2009 the xed interest rates vary from 4.955% to 5.180%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next five to six years being the life of the swaps.
During 2007 08, a further cross currency swap contract for a notional principal amount of 72 million was designated as part of a post-tax hedge of the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS along with Euro denominated borrowings.
This swap had both legs at oating interest with the Group paying three month EURIBOR and receiving three month LIBOR.
The swap was closed in March 2008 at a closing rate of EUR GBP 1.2699, with Euro-denominated borrowings all being designated as a pre-tax net investment hedge for St Hubert at 31 March 2008.
The loss on closure of this swap was separately identi ed in the statement of recognised income and expense.

The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2009 was 138.0 million 2008: 299.4 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 36.8 million 2008: 47.1 million on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in reserves.
Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2009 of 127 million 2008: 150 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These undrawn facilities expire in July 2013.
In July 2008, the Group agreed a new five year multi-currency revolving credit facility of 85 million and 175 million.
On 17 July 2008 all amounts outstanding under the 2004 facility were repaid and the facility cancelled.
The new facility has the same financial covenants as the 2004 and 2006 facilities and includes a maximum net debt EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.
On 5 April 2007, 100 million of revolving credit facilities were repaid and cancelled.
These facilities were replaced by loan notes of 150 million and 10 million issued on 4 April 2007 maturing 4 April 2014 and 4 April 2017.

Other receivables comprise intercompany balances with Dairy Crest Limited.
All intercompany balances are repayable on demand and those on which interest is receivable payable include: an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of 178.2 million 2008: 169.1 million on which interest is receivable at 5.3% 2008: 5.3% : an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of 46.9 million 2008: 45.0 million on which interest is payable at LIBOR 100 basis points 2008: LIBOR 100 basis points.
A convertible loan was issued by Dairy Crest Limited to Dairy Crest Group plc on 15 January 2007.
The loan had a principal value of 236.0 million with a coupon of 0.1% per annum.
On 2 October 2008 the receivable under this loan was sold to a subsidiary undertaking for cash consideration of 228.9 million, being its fair value at that date as advised by external valuation professionals.
Up to its sale, the convertible had been designated as at fair value through pro t and loss having satis ed the conditions in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
Since the loan was neither an equity investment nor currently convertible, it was within the scope of IAS 39.
In addition, the convertible loan contained a derivative, namely a call option to acquire an equity interest in Dairy Crest Limited which meets the requirements in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
The convertible loan was carried at fair value with any gains or losses taken to the income statement up to 2 October 2008.
At 31 March 2008 an external valuation was undertaken resulting in a loss on the convertible loan of 12.3 million.
The valuation at 2 October 2008 was 228.9 million resulting in a gain in the year ended 31 March 2009 of 1.2 million.
The convertible loan is not traded in a publicly quoted market therefore a Black Scholes Option Pricing model was used in order to value the equity portion of the loan at the date of sale.
The input assumptions used were as follows: dividend yield 2.6% 2008: 2.6%, volatility 29% 2008: 23%, risk free rate 3.6% 2008: 5.0%, time to expiry six months 2008: one year.
Dairy Crest Limited is the principal UK Group trading company and therefore the exposure to credit risk on the convertible loan is nil.

The Company receives EURIBOR and pays LIBOR.
Intercompany cross currency swaps have not been designated as cash ow hedges and any gain or loss arising on revaluation is credited or charged to the income statement.
These swaps are used in order to minimise currency exchange risk in the Company and match the 149 million 138 million of external Euro-denominated borrowings at 31 March 2009 2008: 349 million 278 million.
Borrowing facilities The Company has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2009 of 151 million 2008: 150 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.

Under IFRS, currency borrowings are retranslated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
The cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value Note 32 and incorporate movements in both market exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group fide fines net debt so as to include the effective Sterling liability where cross-currency swaps have been used to convert foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.
