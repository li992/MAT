Notes to the financial statements continued 26.
Financial risk factors continued Foreign exchange risk The Company and Group are exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the foreign exchange risk of imports where volumes are significant.
However, the Groups operating businesses generally source the majority of their products from suppliers within their country of operation and so the foreign exchange exposure is limited.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
Details of foreign currency contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date are given in Note 25.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk through its investment in overseas subsidiaries, which is partially offset by foreign currency translation risk in local debt.
Generally, the Group does not hedge any net translation exposure of overseas earnings, although it may in certain circumstances implement hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in market variables of the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit and shareholders funds.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end, a 100 basis points movement in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity by approximately 0.1m 2008: 0.2m.
The impact on the Company would have been 0.6m 2008: 1.2m.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity The Group maintains stores in Canada, Europe and Asia.
Based on the performance of the overseas businesses in the year to April 2009, a 10% change in the value of local currencies against Sterling would affect the Groups profit before tax by 1.4m 2008: 1.6m and the shareholders equity by 4.7m 2008: 4.1m.
There would not have been any impact on the Company.
