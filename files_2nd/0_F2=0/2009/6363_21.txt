G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 G eneral information G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities its subsidiaries controlled by the company collectively comprising the group and the groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 and in the Operating and Financial review on pages 4 to 27 and 32 to 37.
The group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most significant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling.
The groups financial statements are presented in sterling, as the groups primary listing is in the UK.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The address of the registered office is given on page 130.
2 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 111 to 119.
3 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting polices which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.
The comparative income statement for the year ended 31 December 2008 has been re-presented for operations qualifying as discontinued during the current year.
Revenue from continuing operations has been reduced by 14.4m and PBT has been reduced by 1.5m compared to the figures published previously.
Further details of discontinued operations are presented within note 7.
In addition, the comparative balance sheet as at 31 December 2008 has been restated to reflect the completion during 2009 of the initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2008.
Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to 19.1m, with an equivalent increase in the reported value of goodwill.
The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 17. b Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, determined either by the groups ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of consideration payable in respect of put options held by minority shareholders.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the carrying value of the minority interest are allocated against the interest of the parent, except to the extent that the minority has both a binding obligation and the ability to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, in that strategic financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
The groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the groups share of the results and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the groups consolidated financial statements.
Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the groups consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 65 Shareholder information 3 Significant accounting policies continued c Foreign currencies The financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the groups net investment in foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective.
On disposal translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
d Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups fixed rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
Fair value is measured using one of the valuation techniques based on one of the following valuation hierarchies as set out in IFRS 7 Amended : Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow impacts the income statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Net investment hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged net investment impacts the income statement.
e Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the purchase method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an additional interest from a minority in a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at the date of exchange.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included within the net investment in associates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written-off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued e Intangible assets continued Acquisition-related intangible assets Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life.
The directors review acquisitionrelated intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Trademarks up to a maximum of five years Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years Technology up to a maximum of five years Other intangible assets development expenditure Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group.
Such expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifiable asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development.
In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a maximum of ten years.
The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written-off in the year in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets software Computer software is capitalised as an intangible asset if such expenditure both internally generated and externally purchased creates an identifiable asset, if its cost can be measured reliably and if it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits.
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is charged on software so as to write-off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of five years.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 2% Short leasehold buildings under 50 years over the life of the lease Equipment and motor vehicles 10%33.3% Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually.
The directors review the carrying value of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
g Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
PFI assets Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative PFI or similar project, where the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely with the purchaser of the associated services, the groups interest in the asset is classified as a financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade and other receivables.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in securities, which are classified as held-for-trading.
They are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 67 Shareholder information 3 Significant accounting policies continued g Financial instruments continued Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
h Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the first-in-first-out method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
i Impairment The carrying value of the groups assets, apart from inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value in use, where value in use is assessed as the estimated pre-tax future cash flows deriving from the asset discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined with respect to the cash-generating unit to which the asset attaches.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested annually through assessing the carrying values of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill attaches.
An impairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-generating unit is allocated first so as to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying value of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.
The amount of the reversal is limited such that the assets carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined after depreciation and amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
j Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Where repurchased shares are held by an employee benefit trust, they are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from equity.
k Employee benefits Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The discount rate used is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The expected finance income on assets and the finance cost on liabilities are recognised in the income statement as components of finance income and finance cost respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and presented outside the income statement in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested.
Otherwise it is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits vest.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Long-term service benefits The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than retirement benefits represents the present value of the future benefit that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The fair value of share-based payments granted in the form of options is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes valuation technique, adjusted for future dividend receipts and for any market-related performance conditions.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued l Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Items within provisions include loss-making contracts, external claims against the groups captive insurance businesses, costs of meeting lease requirements on unoccupied properties, costs of replacing assets where there is a present contractual obligation and restructuring provisions for the costs of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate discount rate.
m Revenue recognition Revenue Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue for manned security and cash solutions products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to reflect the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion method in respect of construction contracts.
Construction contracts Where significant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Construction contracts are recognised on the balance sheet at cost plus profit recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less progress billings.
Government grants Government grants in respect of items expensed in the income statement are recognised as deductions from the associated expenditure.
Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the lives of the related assets.
Interest Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividends Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
n Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement, except those that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are capitalised.
o Profit from operations Profit from operations is stated after the share of results of associates but before finance income and finance costs.
Exceptional items of particular significance, including restructuring costs, are included within profit from operations but are disclosed separately.
p Income taxes Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 69 Shareholder information 3 Significant accounting policies continued p Income taxes continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
q Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the groups net investment in the leases.
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are incentives to enter into operating leases.
r Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the groups other components.
All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the groups CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
s Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
A discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
t Dividends Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid.
Dividends proposed or declared but not paid are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
u Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations Standards and interpretation issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
The Following revisions to the IFRS will be applicable in future periods, subject to endorsement where applicable.
Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations is applicable for 2010.
This standards will affect the future accounting for acquisitions.
There will be no retrospective impact.
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures are applicable for 2010.
The Amendments require enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risk.
IAS 27 Amendment Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate is applicable for 2010.
The standard will affect the future accounting for transactions with non-controlling interests.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items and Amendment to IAS 39 Reclassification of Financial Assets: Effective Date and Transition applicable for 2010.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements is applicable for 2010.
The standard addresses how service concession operators should apply existing IFRSs to their arrangements.
The group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 70 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques.
Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most significance to the group are detailed below: Valuation of acquired businesses The initial accounting for an acquisition involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the acquisition cost.
In some instances, this initial accounting can only be determined provisionally by the end of the period in which the acquisition is effected because the fair values and or the costs are not known with full certainty.
In such an event, the initial accounting can be completed using provisional values with any adjustments to those provisional values being completed within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Additionally, in determining the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets, in the absence of market prices for similar assets, valuation techniques are applied.
These techniques use a variety of estimates including projected future results and expected future cash flows, discounted using the weighted average cost of capital relevant to the acquisition.
Furthermore, management make an assessment of the useful economic life of acquired intangible assets upon recognition.
Full details of the fair values of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are presented in note 17.
Assessment of the recoverable amounts in respect of assets tested for impairment The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash flows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets.
Such an analysis includes an estimation of the future anticipated results and cash flows, annual growth rates and the appropriate discount rates.
The full methodology and results of the groups impairment testing is presented in note 19.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations The valuation of defined retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualified independent actuaries who use the projected unit credit method for determining the groups obligations.
This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and inflation.
Full details of the groups retirement benefit obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions are presented in note 34.
5 Revenue An analysis of the groups revenue is as follows: 2009 2008 Notes m m Continuing operations Sale of goods 158.0 190.2 Rendering of services 6,726.8 5,618.9 Revenue from construction contracts 123.8 119.4 Revenue from continuing operations as presented in the consolidated income statement 6 7,008.6 5,928.5 Discontinued operations Rendering of services 34.3 223.3 Revenue from construction contracts 6.4 8.0 Revenue from discontinued operations 6,7 40.7 231.3 Other operating income Interest income 12.7 18.4 Net gain in fair value of loan note derivative financial instruments and hedged items 1.0 Expected return on defined retirement benefit scheme assets 68.0 86.5 Total other operating income 81.7 104.9 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 71 Shareholder information 6 Business and geographical segments The group operates in two core product areas: secure solutions and cash solutions.
The group operates on a worldwide basis and derives a substantial proportion of its revenue and PBIT from each of the following geographical regions: Europe comprising the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Continental Europe, North America and New Markets comprising the Middle East and Gulf States, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia Pacific.
Secure solutions provides integrated security solutions for commercial customers such as risk consulting, manned security and security systems and the protection of critical national infrastructure for governments along with care and justice, secure facilities and border protection.
Cash solutions provides the outsourcing of cash cycle management for central banks, financial institutions and retailers.
The segment disclosures are based on the components that the board monitors in making decisions about operating matters.
Such components are identified on the basis of internal reports that the board reviews regularly in allocating resources to segments and in assessing their performance.
This results in a segmental analysis which is similar to that presented previously under IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.

Goodwill arising on acquisition includes 19.6m arising on the acquisition of minority interests.

G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 86 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 9 Intangible assets continued Customer-related intangibles comprise the contractual relationship with customers and the customer relationships which meet the criteria for identification as intangible assets in accordance with IFRS.
Customer contracts and relationships recognised upon the acquisition of Securicor plc on 19 July 2004 are considered significant to the group.
The carrying amount at 31 December 2009 was 96.4m 2008: 138.6m, and the amortisation period remaining in respect of these assets is four and a half years.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs which are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The majority of goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004 which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is finalised and reviewed post-year end.
The groups impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU to its recoverable amount.
CGUs are identified on a country level basis including significant business units, as per the groups detailed management accounts.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations.
These calculations include forecast pre-tax cash flows for a period of five years.
The five-year cash flow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year year one and the business plans for years two and three, the results of which are reviewed by the board, and projections for years four and five, all of which reflect past experience as well as future expected market trends.
Budgeted and forecast cash flows are based on managements assessment of current contract portfolio, contract wins, contract retention and price increases.
Cash flows beyond the five-year forecast period are projected into perpetuity at the lower of the planned growth rate in year three and the forecast underlying economic growth rate for the economies in which the CGU operates.
Where the planned growth rate in year three exceeds the forecast underlying economic growth rate, the excess is reduced progressively in the projections for years four and five.
Growth rates across the groups CGUs range from 0% to 15%, and the into-perpetuity growth rates for the significant CGUs are disclosed in the table below.
Future cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax, weighted average cost of capital which for the group is 8.4% 2008: 11.4%, and the discount rates for the significant CGUs are disclosed in the table below.
Pre-tax cash flows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates derived from calculating the net present value of the post-tax cash flows discounted at post-tax rates.
The group rate is adjusted where appropriate to reflect the different financial risks in each country in which the CGUs operate.
Risk-adjusted discount rates applicable to group entities range from 5.3% in Singapore to 65.9% in Madagascar.
In applying the groups model, no impairment has been identified and recognised in any of the groups CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2009 or for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Management believe that there is currently no reasonably possible change in the underlying factors used in the impairment model which would lead to a material impairment of goodwill.
The following CGUs have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: Goodwill Goodwill Discount rate Discount rate Growth rate Growth rate 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m US secure solutions manned security 7.2% 10.1% 2.5% 5.0% 358.9 388.9 GSL 8.4% 11.4% 2.5% 5.3% 258.1 258.1 UK cash solutions 8.4% 11.4% 2.5% 5.3% 240.4 244.5 Netherlands security solutions 7.3% 10.5% 3.5% 3.9% 125.7 136.6 UK secure solutions manned security 8.4% 11.4% 2.5% 5.3% 117.1 122.8 UK secure solutions justice services 8.4% 11.4% 2.5% 5.3% 95.3 95.3 Estonia secure solutions and cash solutions 13.1% 14.3% 4.0% 3.9% 67.4 73.0 Other all allocated 781.0 760.3 Total goodwill 2,043.9 2,079.5 Growth rate is the long term into-perpetuity growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rates and underlying economic growth rates for each CGU.
With all other variables being equal, a 1% increase in the group discount rate from 8.4% to 9.4% with equivalent increases to the discount rates in all countries would result in a goodwill impairment to the group of 4m, with a 3m impairment required to Estonia.
A significant increase of 3% in the group discount rate from 8.4% to 11.4%, and an equivalent increase in all countries, would result in a group impairment of 60m including impairments of 26m to UK Cash solutions and 11m to Estonia.
A decrease in the underlying growth rate in all countries of 1% would result in a group impairment of 2m, with an impairment of 1m to Estonia.
A decrease of 3% in growth rate would result in a group impairment of 11m including an impairment to Estonia of 8m.
These approximations indicate the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the underlying assumptions.
However, it is highly unlikely that any variations in the assumptions would impact on all CGUs at the same time.

21 Investment in joint ventures At the year end the group owned 59% of the equity of Bridgend Custodial Services Ltd and 50% of the equity in STC Milton Keynes Ltd.
In both cases, the group jointly shares operational and financial control over the operations and is therefore entitled to a proportionate share of the results of each, which are consolidated on the basis of the equity shares held.
The groups correctional facilities in South Africa are under a similar arrangement other than that the groups holding is 20%.
The results of each of the jointly controlled operations are prepared in accordance with group accounting policies.

Group companies are required to follow the Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers.
These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits over a set amount, performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to reflect the different risks within each country in which the group operates.
There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts that are past due according to local conditions and past default experience.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is as follows: 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 59.4 36.4 Amounts written-off during the year 7.7 3.8 Increase in allowance 14.2 26.8 At 31 December 65.9 59.4 Included within trade receivables are trade debtors with a carrying amount of 368m 2008: 384m which are past due at the reporting date for which no provision has been made as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the group believes that the amounts are still recoverable.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The proportion of trade debtors at 31 December 2009 that were overdue for payment was 36% 2008: 36%.
The group-wide average age of all trade debtors at year end was 56 days 2008: 68 days.
To reflect the growing nature of the group, the monthly management accounts use the last three months sales of the year to calculate management trade debtor days.
Using this calculation the group-wide average age of trade debtors at year end was 48 days 2008: 49 days at constant exchange rates.
The directors believe the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash flows, approximates to their book value.
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts Amounts receivable under PFI contracts comprise the groups proportion of amounts receivable in respect of the Private Finance Initiative PFI projects undertaken by the groups joint ventures.
The groups interests under PFI contracts primarily consist of the design, construction, financing and management of HM Prison and Young Offenders Institution Parc in Bridgend, South Wales, for the Home Office: the Oakhill Secure Training Centre for young people in Milton Keynes for the Youth Justices Board and Bloemfontein Correctional Contracts Pty for the Government of South Africa.
The Bridgend contract commenced in January 1996 and expires in December 2022.
The Milton Keynes contract commenced in June 2003 and expires in June 2028.
The Bloemfontein contract commenced in July 2001 and ends in June 2026.
All contracts can be terminated by the customer either in the event of a severe failure to comply with the contract or voluntarily with six months notice and the payment of appropriate compensation 90 days for the Bloemfontein contract.
The specified assets remain the property of the customers.
The groups joint ventures have the right to provide services using the specified assets during the life of the contracts.
There is currently no obligation to acquire or build further assets and any such obligation would be agreed with the customers as variations to the contracts.
The pricing basis is inflation-indexed.
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts are pledged as security against borrowings of the group.
26 Construction contracts Contracts in place at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Amounts due from contract customers included in trade and other receivables 17.0 10.6 Amounts due to contract customers included in trade and other payables 1.8 2.6 Net balances relating to construction contracts 15.2 8.0 Contract costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses to date 180.7 23.6 Less: Progress billings 165.5 15.6 Net balances relating to construction contracts 15.2 8.0 At 31 December 2009, advances received from customers for contract work amounted to 5.7m 2008: 6.0m.
There were no retentions held by customers for contract work at either balance sheet date.
All trade and other receivables arising from construction contracts are due for settlement within one year.
The directors believe the fair value of amounts due from and to contract customers, being the present value of future cash flows, approximates to their book value.

The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system which included over 110 group companies at 31 December 2009.
It is anticipated that the number of participants in the group will continue to grow.
In 2009 the group met the conditions of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation allowing balances within this cash pool to be offset for reporting purposes.
At 31 December 2009 146.9m of the cash balances and the equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were offset.
Previously balances within this cash pool were reported gross.
Cash and cash equivalents of 20.1m 2008: 33.7m are held by the groups wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries.
Their use is restricted to the settlement of claims against the groups captive insurance subsidiaries.

At 31 December 2009, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to 614.7m 2008: 350.4m.
Interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing Libor or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and re-priced within one year or less.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is discussed in note 33.
The group issued fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m 340.6m on 1 March 2007.
The group issued further fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$513.5m 318.0m and 69m on 15 July 2008.
The group issued its inaugural public note of 350m using its European Medium Term Note Programme on 13 May 2009.
The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to one financial covenant net debt to EBITDA ratio and non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity.
The group complied with the financial covenant throughout the year to 31 December 2009 and the year to 31 December 2008.
The group has not defaulted on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year.

The group believes that these returns are maximised when the groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC is minimised and that this is the case when the group broadly has the characteristics of an investment grade BBB rated entity.
The group therefore aims generally to maintain its net debt expressed as a multiple of cash generated from operations broadly within a range corresponding to those of BBB rated entities.
On 9 March 2009 the group obtained a BBB credit rating from Standard & Poors.
The group has a range of return on capital targets in respect of potential acquisitions, depending upon their size.
Most proposals for bolton acquisitions must demonstrate a post-tax return of at least 12% on the capital investment within three years.
Medium-sized acquisitions are required to return a minimum of 10% within this time frame and relatively rare, large, strategic acquisitions a minimum equal to the groups WACC.
The groups calculation of its post-tax WACC at 31 December 2009 was 7.6%.
The group monitors the financial performance of acquired businesses during the years following acquisition against the return targets.
In addition, the group monitors the Return on Net Assets RONA of all its businesses on a monthly basis.
The group regards RONA as a measure of operational performance and therefore calculates it as EBITA divided by net assets excluding goodwill, tax, dividends payable and retirement benefit obligations.
The group has no current intention to commence a share buy-back plan.
The group operates a programme to purchase its own shares on the market on a regular basis so as to provide a pool of shares from which to satisfy share awards to employees as the awards vest.
The group is not subject to externally-imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the groups approach to capital management during the year.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it.
For more details of the groups bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 29.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows: 31 December 2008 19% 31 March 2009 10% 30 June 2009 26% 30 September 2009 27% 31 December 2009 28% The availability of undrawn committed facilities during early 2009 was impacted by the sharp deterioration in the value of sterling against the US dollar and euro in late 2008, being currencies in which a significant proportion of drawn facilities is denominated.
To reduce re-financing risk, group treasury obtains finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source of finance terminating on a single date.
The groups committed facilities, restated at hedged rates where applicable, have the following maturity dates: March 2010 45m June 2012 1,087m July 2013 33m March 2014 62m July 2015 76m July 2016 25m March 2017 124m July 2018 177m March 2019 90m May 2019 350m July 2020 46m March 2022 65m Refinancing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major facility at least 18 months before its termination date.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 96 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Financial risk continued Market risk Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its financing activities in local currency.
However, the group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
The group no longer uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
This foreign exchange hedging programme was terminated in February 2009.
The group believes cash flow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets, given the changed liquidity environment post the global credit crisis.
At 31 December 2009, the groups US dollar and euro net assets were approximately 75% and 87% respectively hedged by foreign currency loans 2008: US dollar 89%, euro 97%.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 134.2m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 29 exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
At 31 December 2009 the nominal value of such contracts was 170.3m in respect of US dollar 2008: 246.9m and 217.7m in respect of euro 2008: 271.7m, their weighted average interest rate was 5.0% US dollar 2008: 5.0% and 3.7% euro 2008: 3.8 %, and their weighted average period to maturity was two and a quarter years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 was kept at fixed rate.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is partly shielded by fixed rate loans and interest rate swaps which fix a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
Assuming a 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies and keeping the 31 December 2009 debt position constant throughout 2010, an additional interest charge of 6.4m would be expected in the 2010 financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
Commodity swaps and commodity options are used to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Commodity swaps hedging 24 million litres of projected 2010 diesel consumption and 7 million litres of projected 2011 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2009.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 97 Shareholder information 33 Financial risk continued Market risk continued Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each outstanding transaction based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the groups relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2009 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 27.6m and 14.1m and were both held with institutions with long-term Moodys credit ratings of Aa3.
These exposures represent 40% and 20% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loans outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2009.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Aa3 rated bank.
At year end credit balances of 147.5m were pooled with debit balances of 146.9m, resulting in a net pool balance of 0.6m.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
34 Retirement benefit obligations The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 109.0m 2008: 95.6m.
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in defined contribution scheme.
Wackenhut Services, Inc WSI is the administrator of several defined benefit schemes.
WSI is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defined benefit schemes as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and WSI its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities.
Therefore, these schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of industry-wide defined benefit schemes which are not valued on an IAS 19 basis as it is not possible to identify separately the groups share of the schemes assets and liabilities.
As a result the schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
Contributions made to the schemes and charged to the income statement in 2009 totalled 7.8m 2008: 7.3m.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2010 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefits is approximately 8.0m assuming consistent exchange rates.
Defined benefit arrangements The group operates a number of defined benefit retirement arrangements where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
In most cases these are calculated on the basis of final pensionable pay, other than for the smallest of the three schemes in the UK and one scheme in the Netherlands where they are based on career average pay.
Liabilities under these arrangements are stated at the discounted value of benefits accrued to date, based upon actuarial advice.
Under unfunded arrangements, the group does not hold the related assets separate from the group.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these arrangements in 2009 totalled 2.8m 2008: 2.3m.
Under funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes.
Whilst the groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material schemes in the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada, Israel and Greece.

They comprise three arrangements: the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S with total membership of approximately 8,000, the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, with total membership of approximately 20,000 and the GSL scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL, with total membership of approximately 2,000.
Regular actuarial assessments of the schemes are carried out, the latest being at 31 March 2007 in respect of the Group 4 scheme, 5 April 2006 in respect of the Securicor scheme and 31 March 2005 in respect of the GSL scheme.
Pension obligations stated in the balance sheet take account of future service and earnings increases, have been updated to 31 December 2009 and use the valuation methodologies specified in IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The three schemes in the UK have combined under one trustee body with effect from 1 January 2010 and will be formally actuarially assessed at 5 April 2010.
At 5 April 2009 the participants of the UK pension schemes can be analysed as follows: Group 4 Falck GSL Securicor At 5 April 2009 Scheme Scheme Scheme Total Active participants Number 618 1,311 1,409 3,338 Average age 53.2 50.8 51.9 51.7 Deferred participants Number 4,559 537 10,352 15,448 Average age 51.3 48.4 50.8 50.9 Pensioner participants Number 2,607 208 7,878 10,693 Average age 68.2 61.1 69.9 69.3 The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: UK Rest of World Key assumptions used at 31 December 2009 Discount rate 5.7% 5.7% Expected return on scheme assets as at 1 January 2009 6.3% 5.8% Expected rate of salary increases 3.6% 2.6% Future pension increases LPI5% 3.4% 2.0% Inflation 3.6% 2.0% Key assumptions used at 31 December 2008 Discount rate 6.3% 5.8% Expected return on scheme assets as at 1 January 2008 6.9% 6.2% Expected rate of salary increases 4.9% 2.9% Future pension increases LPI5% 3.1% 2.0% Inflation 3.1% 2.0% In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes obligations.

The overall expected rate of return is the weighted average of the rates on the individual asset categories.

Additional contributions of at least 30m will also be made in 2010 in respect of the deficit in the schemes.
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to apply the average of the yields on those AA corporate bonds which most closely approximate to the timescale of the liability profile of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 5.65%, in respect of the UK schemes at 31 December 2009 6.3% at 31 December 2008.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 28m.
Liability calculations are also impacted heavily by the mortality projections included in the actuarial assumptions.
The weighted average life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 has been assumed as 20.4 years.
The weighted average life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52 has been assumed as 21.2 years.
The directors consider, on actuarial advice, these assumptions to be appropriate to the profile of the membership of the schemes.
The effect of a one-year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 70m.
Pension obligations in respect of deferred members increase in line with inflation.
Increases in salaries and increases in pensions-in-payment generally move in line with inflation.
Inflation is therefore an important assumption in the calculation of defined retirement benefit liabilities.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the rate of inflation assumption applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 16m.

Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
Claims reserves The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash solutions, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Onerous contracts The onerous contract provision mainly comprises the provision against future liabilities for loss-making contracts, for all properties sub-let at a shortfall, for the cost of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement and for long-term idle, leased properties.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2009 2008 m m Deferred tax liabilities 123.1 138.1 Deferred tax assets 178.1 155.0 Total deferred tax position 55.0 16.9 At the balance sheet date, the group has unutilised tax losses of approximately 528.1m 2008: 526.8m potentially available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 27.2m 2008: 5.1m has been recognised in respect of approximately 78.4m 2008: 22.9m of gross losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 449.7m 2008: 503.9m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of 2.7m, 3.3m, 1.8m, 1.6m, 1.2m and 3.3m which will expire in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1,329m 2008: 2,727m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
At the balance sheet date, the group has total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately nil 2008: 4.0m relating to unresolved tax issues in various jurisdictions.
