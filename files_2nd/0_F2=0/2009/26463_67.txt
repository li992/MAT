On 31 March 2009 as part of an internal reorganisation, the Company disposed of Borsa Italiana S. p. A. to London Stock Exchange Group Holdings Italy Ltd for 1,322.1m, financed by share capital of 18.7m, share premium of 886.5m and loan notes of 416.9m.
At 31 March 2009, the Company recognised an impairment charge amounting to 768.9m relating to its investment in its subsidiary London Stock Exchange plc.
This impairment was based on a value in use calculation using discounted cash flow projections prepared by management covering the five year period ending 31 March 2014, in which short and medium term revenue and cost growth assumptions reflect current trends, anticipated market developments, discussions with customers and suppliers, and managements experience, taking account of an expected recovery in underlying financial markets.
Cash flows beyond this five year period were extrapolated using a 3.0 per cent long term growth rate, and a 12.4 per cent pre tax discount rate was applied to the resulting projections.
The carrying value of the investment in London Stock Exchange plc arose as a result of the group reconstruction in May 2006 when the Company became the holding company of London Stock Exchange plc pursuant to a scheme of arrangement.
The impairment was driven by the significant deterioration in the economic conditions in the UK, corresponding reductions in expected revenues, greater uncertainty about the future and a change in the discount rate.
Based on the results of the value in use calculations referred to in note 15, no impairment of the carrying value of the Companys investment in Borsa Italiana S. p. A. was considered necessary.
