NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 March 2010.
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2009 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation.
Adjustments are made on consolidation translating any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
Adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.
They did however give rise to additional disclosures.
The other pronouncements which came into force during the year were not relevant to the Group: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Revised The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 which clarifies the definition of vesting conditions and prescribes the treatment for an award that is cancelled.
The Group adopted this amendment as of 1 January 2009.
It did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
Fair value measurements related to items recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value.
In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well as significant transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management.
The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in note 24.
The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented in note 24.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 replaced lAS 14 Segment Reporting upon its effective date.
The Group concluded that the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 are the same as the business segments previously identified under lAS 14.
IFRS 8 disclosures are shown in note 3, including the related revised comparative information.
lAS 1 Presentation of Financial statements The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The statement of changes in equity includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented in a reconciliation of each component of equity.
In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present two statements.
lAS 23 Borrowing Costs The revised lAS 23 requires capitalisation of borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset.
The Groups previous policy was to expense borrowing costs as they were incurred.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of the amended lAS 23, the Group has adopted the standard on a prospective basis.
Therefore, borrowing costs are capitalised on qualifying assets with a commencement date on or after 1 January 2009.
During the 12 months to 31 December 2009 no borrowing costs were incurred on qualifying assets.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued lAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and lAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation The standards have been amended to allow a limited scope exception for puttable financial instruments to be classified as equity if they fulfil a number of specified criteria.
The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the financial position or the performance of the Group.
Improvements to IFRSs In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies but did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: clarifies that the disclosures required in respect of noncurrent assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale or discontinued operations are only those set out in IFRS 5.
The disclosure requirements of other IFRSs only apply if specifically required for such non-current assets or discontinued operations.
As a result of this amendment, the Group amended its disclosures in note 3 segmental analysis.
IFRS 8 Operating Segment Information: clarifies that segment assets and liabilities need only be reported when those assets and liabilities are included in measures that are used by the chief operating decision maker.
As the Groups chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities the Group has chosen not to disclose this information in note 2. lAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Assets and liabilities classified as held for trading in accordance with lAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not automatically classified as current in the statement of financial position.
The Group analysed whether the expected period of realisation of financial assets and liabilities differed from the classification of the instrument.
This did not result in any reclassification of financial instruments between current and non-current in the Balance Sheet.
lAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Replaces the term net selling price with fair value less costs to sell.
The Group amended its accounting policy accordingly, which did not result in any change in the financial position.
lAS 18 Revenue: The IASB has added guidance which accompanies the standard to determine whether an entity is acting as a principal or as an agent.
The features to consider are whether the entity: has primary responsibility for providing the goods or service: has inventory risk: has discretion in establishing prices: and bears the credit risk.
The Group has assessed its revenue arrangements against these criteria and concluded that it is acting as principal in all arrangements.
The revenue recognition accounting policy has been updated accordingly.
lAS 23 Borrowing Costs: The definition of borrowing costs is revised to consolidate the two types of items that are considered components of borrowing costs into one the interest expense calculated using the effective interest rate method calculated in accordance with lAS 39.
The Group has amended its accounting policy accordingly which did not result in any change in its financial position.
lAS 36 Impairment of Assets: When discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value less cost to sell additional disclosure is required about the discount rate, consistent with disclosures required when the discounted cash flows are used to estimate value in use.
This amendment had no immediate impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group because the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units is currently estimated using value in use.
The amendment clarified that the largest unit permitted for allocating goodwill, acquired in a business combination, is the operating segment as defined in IFRS 8 before aggregation for reporting purposes.
The amendment has no impact on the Group as the annual impairment test is performed before aggregation.
New standards and interpretations not yet effective During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which are expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future financial years.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised and lAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Amended IFRS 3 Revised introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date.
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interests, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
These changes will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
lAS 27 Amended requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The changes by IFRS 3 Revised and lAS 27 Amended will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests.
The change in accounting policy is effective from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The other pronouncements not included above are not expected to be relevant to the Group upon adoption, in the context of the Groups circumstances.
52 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Critical judgments and estimates The preparation of the Groups financial statements requires management to make judgments on how to apply the Groups accounting policies and make estimates about the future.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgments and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
The more significant judgments and estimates, where a risk exists that a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year could occur, relate to: revenue recognition where, on a limited number of support and managed services contracts, an estimate of the total contract costs is required to determine the stage of completion: estimation of residual value of assets owned to support certain contracts: impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, which is based upon estimates of future cash flows and discount rates for the relevant cash-generating units: recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward, which are dependent upon estimates of future profitability of certain Group companies: and other estimated tax positions, where the decisions of tax authorities are uncertain.
Further information is provided within this note summarising significant accounting policies, and notes 9 and 14 to the financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold buildings 2550 years Short leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Fixtures and fittings Head office 515 years Other shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Office machinery, computer hardware 215 years Motor vehicles 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets Software and software licences Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is calculated on straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.
Currently software is amortised over four years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development Costs that are incurred and that can be specifically attributed to the development phase of management information systems for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are carried initially at fair value.
Following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Existing customer contracts Period to the end of the acquired contract Existing customer relationships 10 years Tools and technology 7 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
54 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Business combinations on or after 1 January 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
Goodwill recognised on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, is recorded at its amortised cost at transition to IFRS and is no longer amortised.
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 remains set off directly against reserves even if the related investment becomes impaired or the business is disposed of.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where an asset does not have independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or cashgenerating unit.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs associated with the investment.
Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts where a right of set-off exists.
Interest-bearing borrowings All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is fide-recognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is fide-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to the income statement.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro and US dollar US$.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
56 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
VAT Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT except: where the VAT incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Product Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
Professional Services Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following delivery of a service or in line with the stage of work completed.
Support and Managed Services Contracted service revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis.
Usually revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis, when this is representative of the stage of completion of an individual contract.
Unrecognised contracted revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one period are deferred and recognised over their relevant life.
On a limited number of Support and Managed Service contracts recognising revenue on a straight-line basis is not representative of the stage of completion.
On these contracts, the stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate.
Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Operating leases Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined contribution scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no material pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 27.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market-related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share see note 10.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 26.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
58 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 3 Segmental analysis For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical segments, with each segment determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss which is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.
At a Group level however management measures performance on adjusted profit before tax.
Adjusted operating profit or loss takes account of the interest paid on customer-specific financing CSF which management considers to be a cost of sale.
Excluded from adjusted operating profit is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items and the transfer of internal ERP implementation costs as management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of a segment.
Segmental performance for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 2008 was as follows: UK Germany France Benelux Total 000 000 000 000 000 For the year ended 31 December 2009 Results Revenue 1,226,917 930,673 319,384 26,224 2,503,198 Adjusted gross profit 181,149 124,395 37,448 2,838 345,830 Adjusted net operating expenses 143,310 104,831 40,169 3,597 291,907 Adjusted segment operating profit loss 37,839 19,564 2,721 759 53,923 Adjusted net interest 302 Adjusted profit before tax 54,225 Other segment information Capital expenditure: Property, plant and equipment 11,042 8,107 783 118 20,050 Intangible fixed assets 11,891 15,301 71 27,263 Depreciation 24,015 10,064 1,118 129 35,326 Amortisation 3,302 1,209 120 4,631 Share-based payments 1,893 357 305 2,555 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 3 Segmental analysis continued UK Germany France Benelux Total 000 000 000 000 000 For the year ended 31 December 2008 Results Revenue 1,391,177 830,740 308,210 30,008 2,560,135 Adjusted gross profit 194,934 113,703 38,821 3,372 350,830 Adjusted net operating expenses 165,324 99,386 40,511 3,465 308,686 Adjusted segment operating profit loss 29,610 14,317 1,690 93 42,144 Adjusted net interest 963 Adjusted profit before tax 43,107 Other segment information Capital expenditure: Property, plant and equipment 28,725 7,663 1,105 229 37,722 Intangible fixed assets 11,903 1,067 1,308 14,278 Depreciation 27,715 7,804 1,078 122 36,719 Amortisation 2,816 827 1,121 4,764 Share-based payments 2,009 334 182 2,525 Reconciliation of adjusted results Management reviews adjusted measures of performance as shown in the tables above.

The disposal does not match the criteria of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations as the disposal does not represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and hence was not treated as a discontinued operation.
The Group received consideration of 2,982,000 in cash and cash equivalents, net of costs incurred in relation to the sale.
This is offset by the disposal of goodwill associated with the business of 1,002,000.
The directly attributable goodwill associated with the Trade Distribution business originally arose from the acquisition of Metrologie UK in 1999.
Separately, related inventories of 8,574,000 were sold to Ingram Micro at cost.
Restructuring costs arise from the change programme to reduce costs.
They include expenses from headcount reductions of 5,309,000 and vacant premises costs of 1,869,000.
62 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 5 Exceptional items continued 2008 The forecasted cash flows for Computacenter France do not support the value of the non-current assets in the business.
An exceptional impairment was recognised in 2008 in relation to additions to intangible assets relating to the Group ERP programme that were specifically allocated to the French cash-generating unit.
After the 2008 year-end a decision was reached to cease using the Digica brand following the integration of the Digica operations into those of Computacenter UK Limited.
An exceptional impairment of the trademark, generated at the time of acquisition, was recognised accordingly.
The tax charge for 2008 contained two items which, due to their size, were disclosed separately, as follows: during 2008 agreement was reached on certain significant items for earlier years: and the deferred tax asset in respect of losses in Germany was re-assessed in line with managements view of the entities future performance.
Where the reassessment exceeded the losses utilised in the year, the change in the recoverable amount of the deferred tax asset was shown as an exceptional item.

Where deferred tax assets have been reassessed in excess of the losses utilised in the year, the change in the recoverable amount of the deferred tax asset is shown as an exceptional item in the income tax expense for the year, due to the material nature and expected infrequency of this reassessment.
In addition, at 31 December 2009, there were unused tax losses across the Group of 188.1 million 2008: 212.0 million for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Of these losses, 111.1 million 2008: 138.8 million arise in Germany, albeit a significant proportion have been generated in statutory entities that no longer have significant levels of trade.
The remaining unrecognised tax losses relate to other loss-making overseas subsidiaries.

Disposal of Goodwill On 27 October 2009, Computacenter UK sold its Trade Distribution business.
As a consequence, directly attributable goodwill of 1,002,000 was disposed of, and included within the exceptional profit on disposal of business note 5.
This goodwill arose from the acquisition of Metrologie UK in 1999.
Additions to Goodwill During the year, additions to goodwill arose from the purchase of becom in Germany on 26 November 2009 and Thesaurus in the UK on 27 November 2009.
The recoverable amount of the assets of Thesaurus were acquired by and were immediately integrated within Computacenter UK Limited.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of 1,454,000 has been tested for impairment against the Computacenter UK Limited cash-generating unit.
Computacenter UK Limited and RD Trading Limited cash-generating units The recoverable amounts of Computacenter UK Limited and RD Trading Limited have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of 2.5 per cent 2008: 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for Computacenter UK Limited and RD Trading Limited for 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 12.0 per cent 2008: 13.0 per cent.
The Computacenter UK Limited and RD Trading cash-generating units generate value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
No impairment provision on goodwill has been required at either 31 December 2009 or at 31 December 2008. becom Informationssysteme GmbH becom cash-generating unit Goodwill of 12,140,000 relating to the acquisition of becom has been allocated to the becom cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount has been based upon the financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period, and on long-term market growth rates of 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for becom at 31 December 2009 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on market share and long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 12.0 per cent.
Since acquisition the business has performed in line with the anticipated value-in-use determined at acquisition, and management are confident that becom will continue to perform in line with or exceed forecasts for the foreseeable period.
As a result, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
The assets and liabilities of becom will be integrated fully with Computacenter Germany during 2010.
As a result it is expected that, going forward, the cash flows will not be reliably and separately identifiable and that the goodwill relating this is acquisition will be tested for impairment against the Computacenter Germany cash-generating unit.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.
In early 2009, a decision was reached to cease using the Digica brand following the integration of the Digica operations into those of Computacenter UK Limited.
An exceptional non-cash full impairment charge of 1.9 million for the trademark generated at the time of the Digica acquisition was recognised accordingly in the year ended 31 December 2008.

The costs of acquisition amounted to 258,000. becom is based in Germany and is a leading IT infrastructure services provider.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of becom for the one month period from the acquisition date.
The book and fair values of the net assets at date of acquisition were as follows: Provisional fair value Book value to Group 000 000 Intangible assets Comprising: Existing customer relationships 1,348 Software 151 151 Total intangible assets 151 1,499 Property, plant and equipment 376 376 Investment in associate 169 64 Deferred income tax assets 388 Inventories 275 275 Trade and other receivables 13,512 12,220 Prepayments 91 91 Cash and short term deposits 286 286 Trade and other payables 15,009 17,706 Deferred income 110 110 Financial liabilities 7,111 7,111 Deferred tax liabilities 405 Net liabilities 7,370 10,133 Goodwill arising on acquisition 12,140 2,007 Discharged by: Cash 1,778 Costs associated with the acquisition, settled in cash 229 2,007 From the date of acquisition, becom has contributed 12,114,000 to the Groups revenue and 196,000 to the Groups profit after tax.
The provisional fair values include adjustments to the book values to recognise additional accruals for further expected tax liabilities and to reflect the value of the customer relationships acquired with the business.
At acquisition becom held various intercompany balances with other companies within the Group of which it was a member.
As part of the provisional fair value calculations the Group has made provision against these receivables where it does not expect to recover the amounts due.
Deferred tax assets arise from the timing differences on the other fair value adjustments.
Included in the 12,140,000 of goodwill arising on acquisition are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.
On 27 November 2009 the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities of Thesaurus Computer Services Limited Thesaurus from Thesaurus Computer Services Limited and BDO LLP for a consideration of 900,000.
The costs of acquisition amounted to 10,000.
Thesaurus is a private company based in the UK which provides mainframe service solutions.

b Finance leases The finance leases are only secured on the assets that they finance.
These assets are in the main used to satisfy specific customer contracts.
There are a small number of assets that are utilised internally.
c Other loans The other loans are unsecured borrowings to finance equipment sold to customers on specific contracts or for equipment for own use.
74 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 21 Financial liabilities continued d Factor financing Computacenter UK and Computacenter France have access to factor financing arrangements.
France Factor financing is in respect of trade debts factored with recourse which represents a proportion of the debts.
Under the terms of the arrangement certain trade debts are sold to the factor who in turn advances cash payments in relation to these debts.
Interest is charged on these amounts on a daily basis at a rate of ECB base rate 0.7 per cent.
The Group is not obliged and does not intend to support any losses arising from the assigned debts against which the cash has been advanced.
In the event of default in payment of a debtor, the providers of finance seek repayment of cash advanced only from the remainder of the cash pool of debts in which they hold an interest: repayment is not required from the Group in any other way.
UK Factor financing is in respect of trade debts factored with recourse which represents a proportion of the debts.
A nonutilisation fees is payable at 0.25 per cent of the available facility where the amounts drawn down equate to less than 50 per cent of said facility.
In the event of a default in payment of a debtor the Group is obliged to support losses to the extent of cash advanced against that debt.
In normal circumstances this will be recovered from the cash pool of debts in which they hold an interest.
The Group is obliged to repay any advance of cash in excess of the maximum amount available for draw-down as calculated under the terms of the agreement.
e Facilities At 31 December 2009, the Group had available 100.3 million 2008: 163.4 million of uncommitted overdraft and factoring facilities.
The Group also had access to a 60.0 million committed facility of which 42.9 million is not utilised as at the balance sheet date.
This facility expires in May 2011.
22 Obligations under leases a Finance lease commitments The Group has finance leases for various items of plant and machinery: these leases have no terms of renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments are as follows: 2009 2008 Minimum Present value Minimum Present value of payments of payments payments payments 000 000 000 000 Within one year 22,462 20,818 24,480 19,819 After one year but not more than five years 22,848 21,849 37,562 35,372 45,310 42,667 62,042 55,191 b Operating lease commitments where the Group is lessee The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, motor vehicles and items of small machinery.
There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.
Future commitments payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Not later than one year 35,756 38,922 After one year but not more than five years 47,993 50,065 More than five years 14,574 16,061 98,323 105,048 c Operating lease receivables where the Group is lessor During the year the Group entered into commercial leases with customers on certain items of machinery.

The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at a rate based upon the Bank of England base rate.
Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
24 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Finance Directors Review on pages 18 to 21. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
In France, credit risk is mitigated through a credit insurance policy which applies to non-Government customers and provides insurance for approximately 50 per cent of the relevant credit risk exposure.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, invoice factoring in France and the UK and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
When long-term borrowings are utilised, the Groups policy is to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other financial instruments carried within the Groups financial statements is not materially different from their carrying amount.
76 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 24 Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Effect Change on profit in basis before tax points 000 2009 Sterling 25 97 Euro 25 52 2008 Sterling 25 99 Euro 25 92 The impact of a reasonably possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2009 the Group held 61 foreign exchange contracts 2008: 14 as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The terms of these contracts are detailed below: 31 December 2009 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euros Sterling 2,630,000 Mar 10 1.1208 Sterling Dollars $5,632,000 JanFeb 10 1.5841.615 Sterling SA rand R400,500 Jan 10 11.9438 Dollars Sterling $2,537,000 JanFeb 10 1.5941.668 SA rand Sterling R801,000 Jan 10 11.95811.978 Germany Dollars Euros $39,906,000 JanApr 10 1.4351.508 Euros Dollars $2,695,000 JanFeb 10 1.4601.487 31 December 2008 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euros Sterling 7,036,000 JanMar 09 1.0311.032 Dollars Sterling $5,500,000 Jan 09 1.449 Germany Dollars Euros $15,300,000 Jan 09 1.2651.421 Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was an asset of 726,000 2008: 644,000 liability.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax or equity.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 24 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2009 Financial liabilities 18,608 11,605 37,399 23,027 90,639 Property provisions 312 1,844 9,345 2,847 14,348 Trade and other payables 378,929 378,929 18,608 390,846 39,243 32,372 2,847 483,916 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2008 Financial liabilities 48,867 15,254 45,905 44,112 154,138 Forward currency contracts 634 10 644 Property provisions 247 1,853 6,304 3,261 11,665 Trade and other payables 378,721 378,721 48,867 394,856 47,758 50,426 3,261 545,168 Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The 3 levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 December 2009 the Group had Forward Currency Contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of an asset of 726,000 31 December 2008: liability of 644,000.
The realised gains from forward currency contracts in the period to 31 December 2009 of 1,370,000, are offset by broadly equivalent realised losses on the related underlying transactions.
25 Capital management Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
In line with this approach the Group has repurchased share capital where it has been enhancing to earnings per share.
In 2009, the Group also purchased a further 0.6 million of shares for use in various employee share schemes.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the dividend policy is to maintain a relatively low level of cover of between 22.5 times.
In 2009 the cover was 2.5 times, on a pre-exceptional basis 2008: 2.6 times.
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates, which has typically resulted in borrowings in France and Germany with cash on deposit in the UK.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this customer-specific financing are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes this customer-specific financing when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues.
These financing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
78 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 25 Capital management continued The measures of net funds that the Group monitors are: 2009 2008 000 000 Net funds excluding customer-specific financing 86,403 4,609 Customer-specific loans 6,488 34,009 Customer-specific finance leases 42,567 55,191 Net funds debt 37,348 84,591 The net funds excluding customer-specific financing improved in the year from 4.6 million to 86.4 million by the end of the year.
The rise in net funds ahead of earnings is due to a number of factors.
Firstly the sale of the trade distribution business in the UK released an estimated 30 million working capital: secondly the Group benefited by an estimated 30 million from improved credit terms with a significant vendor in UK and Germany: cash receipts at the end of December 2009 were stronger than usually experienced: and finally, there was a benefit of 10 million due to early settlement on a customer contract that is financed by a customer-specific financing arrangement.
The increase in the year is achieved after taking account of investment in the ERP system in the period of some 11 million.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements.
Each operating country manages working capital in line with Group policies.
The Group intends to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow.
In 2009, as a consequence, the UK simplified its organisation and exited the Trade Distribution business.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.

Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 26 Authorised and issued capital and reserves continued Own shares held Own shares held comprise the following: i Computacenter Employee Share Ownership Plan Shares in the parent undertaking comprise 4,998,011 2008: 5,813,066 6 pence ordinary shares of Computacenter plc purchased by the Computacenter Employee Share Ownership Plan the Plan.
The number of shares held represents 3.3 per cent 2008: 3.8 per cent of the Companys issued share capital.
None of these shares were awarded to executives of the Company under the Computacenter UK Limited Cash Bonus and Share Plan.
Options previously awarded are to be held on behalf of employees and former employees of Computacenter UK Limited and their dependants, excluding Jersey residents.
The distribution of these shares is dependant upon the trustee holding them on the employees behalf for a restrictive period of three years.
Since 31 December 2002 the definition of beneficiaries under the ESOP Trust has been expanded to include employees who have been awarded options to acquire ordinary shares of 6p each in Computacenter plc under the other employee share plans of the Computacenter Group, namely the Computacenter Services Group plc Approved Executive Share Option Plan, the Computacenter Employee Share Option Scheme 1998, the Computacenter Services Group plc Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, the Computacenter Performance Related Share Option Scheme 1998, the Computacenter Sharesave Plus Scheme and any future similar share ownership schemes.
All costs incurred by the Plan are settled directly by Computacenter UK Limited and charged in the accounts as incurred.
