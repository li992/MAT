The Company is deemed to control Tulipe Oil SA in accordance with FRS 2 as it has a majority of the voting rights on the board of Tulipe Oil SA.
The Company is required to assess the carrying values of each of its investments in subsidiaries for impairment.
The net assets of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are predominantly intangible exploration and evaluation E&E assets.
Where facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an E&E asset held by a subsidiary may exceed its recoverable amount, by reference to the specific indicators of impairment of E&E assets in IFRS 6, an impairment test of the asset is performed by the subsidiary undertaking and the asset is impaired by any difference between its carrying value and its recoverable amount.
The recognition of such an impairment by a subsidiary is used by the Company as the primary basis for determining whether or not there are indications that the investment in the related subsidiary may also be impaired, and thus whether an impairment test of the investment carrying value needs to be performed.
The results of exploration activities are inherently uncertain, and the assessment for impairment of E&E assets by the subsidiary, and that of the related investment by the Company, is judgemental.

Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2009 was as follows: Stg US$ Total m m m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 0.2 8.2 8.4 Amounts due from subsidiaries at LIBOR 1.7% 183.4 183.4 Fixed rate debt 342.2 342.2 Floating rate debt 37.0 446.3 483.3 Net cash debt 146.6 780.3 633.7 The profile at 31 December 2008 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg US$ Total m m m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 29.8 29.8 Amounts due from subsidiaries at LIBOR 1.7% 494.6 494.6 Fixed rate debt 69.1 69.1 Floating rate debt 642.3 642.3 Net cash debt 524.4 711.4 187.0 Cash at bank at floating interest rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The US$2 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 350 basis points to 375 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The Reserves Based Lending Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant cash balances.
The $250 million Corporate Facility is a revolving facility which is repayable in full on 31 December 2011.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin of 500 basis points.
The Corporate Facility states that the terms of the Reserves Based Lending Facility Hedging Policy above shall apply to the Corporate Facility.
148 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts At the end of December 2009, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to US$620 million 389.3 million : US$370 million 232.3 million under the US$ 2 Billion Reserves Based Lending and US$250 million 157.0 million under the Corporate Facility.
At the end of December 2008, the headroom under the two facilities was US$335 million 231.4 million : US$235 million 162.3 million under the US$ 1,350 million Reserves Based Lending Facility and US$100 million 69.1 million under the Hardman Bridge Facility.
The Company is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Company hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps.
The two year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 2.61% for a current notional principal of US$100 million 62.8 million.
The three year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 2.19% for a current notional principal of US$250 million 156.7 million.
The five year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 3.14% for a notional principal of US $50 million 31.4 million.
The effect of the interest rate collar currently in place limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at varying rates maximum of 4.3% over the remaining life of the derivative May 2011 for a current notional principal of US$50 million 31.4 million.
The combined mark-to-market position as at the 2009 year end was 5.6 million 2008: 2.1 million.
The interest rate hedges are included in the fixed rate debt in 2009, in the above table, and were also included in fixed rate debt in 2008.
Foreign currency risk As at 31 December 2009, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Company that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$1,337 million 839.4 million cash drawings under the US$2 billion Borrowing Base Facility.
As at 31 December 2008 the only material assets or liabilities that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$930 million 642.3 million cash drawings under the US$1,350 million Borrowing Base facility and US$100 million 69.1 million cash drawings under the $200 million Hardman Bridge Facility.
These US Dollar cash drawings at 31 December 2009 continue to be held as a hedge against US Dollar denominated net assets in subsidiaries.
The net carrying amount of the Companys foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date was 825.3 million 2008: 711.3 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Company is mainly exposed to fluctuation in the US dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2009, a 20% increase in Sterling against the US Dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 140.0 million 2008: 118.6 million 20% decrease and a 20% decrease in Sterling against US Dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 209.9 million 2008: 177.8million 20% increase.
Loans from subsidiary undertakings Amounts falling due after more than one year 2009 2008 m m Loans from subsidiary companies 156.3 127.7 The amounts due from subsidiaries do not accrue interest.

2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS.
Options normally only become exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant and if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against constituents of an index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the index over three years following grant.
For awards from March 2008 the Index is the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts : for awards before March 2008, the Index is the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
Options granted under the previous 1998 ESOS had all been exercised at 31 December 2009.
All awards under the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the FRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payments.

UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004.
These are all employee plans, which have been set up in the UK and Ireland, that enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.

Matching shares are subject to time based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value at the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date which is treated as a three month share option for IFRS 2 purposes.
For the Irish plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date which does not result in any IFRS 2 accounting charge.
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period.
The Company recognised a total expense of 0.1 million 2008: 0.1 million for the matching shares and 0.1 million 2008: 0.1 million for the partnership shares.
