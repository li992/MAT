7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 72 72 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 GENERAL INFORMATION BTG plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2009 comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were approved for issue by the Board on 13 May 2009.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Groups accounting policies approved by the Board and are described below.
No new accounting standards and interpretations have been adopted in the year.
Accounting standards issued but not adopted Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Cost of an investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: A Revised Presentation IFRIC 14: IAS 19 The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Finding Requirements and their Interaction Amendments to IFRS 2 Share Based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Instruments All of the above standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the EU and will be relevant for BTGs results for the financial year ended 31 March 2010.
IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting is due to replace IAS 14 for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendments to disclosure requirements will have no effect on the reported results but may change the analysis of segmental information contained in note 5.
The Group does not consider that any of the other standards or interpretations will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Going concern basis After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
This conclusion has been reached having considered the effect of liquidity risk on the Groups ability to operate effectively.
Currently, liquidity risk is not considered a significant business risk to the Group given its level of net cash and cashflow projections.
The Group does not currently require significant levels of debt financing to operate its business.
Further details of the Groups policies and objectives around liquidity risk are given in note 34 to the Accounts.
The key liquidity risks faced by the Group are considered to be the failure of banks where funds are deposited and the failure of key licensees or insurers.
In addition to the liquidity risks considered above, the directors have also considered the following factors when reaching the conclusion to continue to adopt the going concern basis: The Groups principal licensees are global industry leaders in their respective fields and the Groups royalty-generating intellectual property is a broad portfolio of both licensees and industries: and The Groups sales products are life-saving in nature, providing some protection against the current uncertain economic outlook.

The costs relate to the following: The release of the fair value uplift of inventory acquired: Amortisation arising on intangible assets acquired: and Reorganisation costs comprising redundancy, property costs and asset impairments.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
Details on the transition of the Company accounts to IFRS are given on pages 123 and 124.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for investments classified as availablefor-sale.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 3. b Basis of consolidation Subsidiary undertakings Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity-accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds the carrying value of its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and no further losses are recognised except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 74 74 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Acquisition accounting The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values on the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets, including intangible assets acquired, is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
Merger reserve A merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
c Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing particular products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal of the investment.
e Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 75 75 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued f Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and associates.
In respect of business combinations that have occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets, including intangible assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy 2 l. In respect of associates, the carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in the associate.
ii Intangible assets patents and other intellectual property Initial recognition Intangible assets acquired as a result of a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations.
Other intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
Cost includes the cost of obtaining patent protection for intellectual property rights IPR, the cost of acquisition of patents and the costs of the internal patent attorney specific to obtaining patent protection.
Income from patents is derived through licensing and other agreements.
Amortisation All intangible assets are amortised in a manner calculated to write off the cost, on a straight-line basis, over the effective life of the asset.
In determining the appropriate life of the asset, consideration is given to the remaining patent life and the expected cash generating life of the asset if different.
In the event that a patent is abandoned, the balance of unamortised expenditure is written off immediately.
If an intangible asset is considered to have suffered impairment in value it is written down to its estimated recoverable amount in accordance with the Groups policy on impairment see accounting policy 2 l. Income statement disclosure Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is included within operating expenses in the income statement.
Subsequent expenditure Expenditure subsequent to the initial acquisition of intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
iii Intangible assets computer software Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses see accounting policy 2 l. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the licence period and three years to write the assets down to their residual value.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses see accounting policy 2 l. 7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 76 76 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued ii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write assets down to their residual value at the following annual rates: Buildings and improvements 510% Leasehold improvements 1050% Plant and machinery 1015% Furniture and equipment 1050% Motor vehicles 20% Computer hardware 2033% Depreciation is not charged until the asset is brought into use.
The residual value is reassessed annually.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount exceeds the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment charge is recorded in operating expenses in the income statement unless it results from a reorganisation of the Group.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in profit loss on sale of tangible assets in the income statement.
h Investments Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group, classified as being available-for-sale, are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses which are taken to the income statement.
When these investments are no longer recognised as assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
i Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises materials, direct labour and a share of production overheads appropriate to the relevant stage of production.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Net realisable value is determined at the balance sheet date on commercially saleable products based on estimated selling price less all further costs to completion and all relevant marketing, selling and distribution costs.
Inventories relating to research and development projects are fully written down in the income statement unless the Group considers it probable to realise economic value from their sale or use.
If the circumstances that previously caused these inventories to be written down below cost subsequently change and there is clear evidence of an increase in realisable value, the write down is reversed.
j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses see accounting policy 2 l. k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 77 77 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued l Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in value.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see accounting policies 2 f, 2 g and 2 h. For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
In the case of equity investments, an impairment is deemed to arise when there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the equity instrument.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Tangible fixed assets are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date and whenever there are events that indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised if an assets carrying amount exceeds the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Unamortised intangible assets are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.
All intangible assets are also tested for impairment whenever there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cashflows.
Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When assessing the recoverable amount of an intangible asset the Group uses a risk adjusted discounted cashflow model.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through the income statement.
If the fair value of an investment classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in the income statement.
m Government grants Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods in which the related costs are incurred and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
n Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with in the same manner as payments to defined contribution plans where the Groups obligations under the plans are equivalent to a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The funds of the schemes are independent of the Groups finances.
ii Defined benefit plan For the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The assumptions used to determine the valuation are shown in note 30.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 78 78 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Assets of the pension scheme are held separately from the Groups assets.
iii Share-based payments In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to all share-based grants made to employees after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company, subject to certain criteria.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an expense of employment in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense in any year is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
However if share options fail to vest due to share prices not achieving the designated performance threshold for vesting, no such adjustment takes place.
o Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
A charge for restructuring costs is taken to the income statement when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
p Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
q Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts received or receivable in respect of the sale of goods and services to customers during the year, net of trade discounts given and value added tax, and in respect of licence agreements and research and collaboration agreements.
A description of the various elements of revenue and the associated accounting policies is given below: Licence agreements Revenue from licence agreements is credited to the income statement on an accruals basis based on royalty periods completed in the financial year.
Up-front, non-refundable licence down payments where the Group has met all its obligations are credited to the income statement on signature of the relevant agreement.
Other conditional payments are credited to the income statement as the Group becomes entitled to them, usually on the achievement of specific technical or regulatory milestones stipulated in the agreement.
A paid-up licence typically involves a fixed one-off payment by the licensee for freedom from suit by the Group rather than ongoing milestone or royalty payments.
Where there is no ongoing obligation on the Group, the receipt is credited to income when the Group becomes entitled to it.
If the Group has continuing obligations, such as to maintain the patents, revenue is recognised in line with the ongoing performance obligation.
Outright sales or assignments of IPR are treated as disposals of non-current assets.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 79 79 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Products The Group recognises revenue for product sales when each condition of IAS 18, paragraph 14 is wholly-satisfied.
Where sales arrangements specify a second element of revenue contingent upon a specified event, this revenue is not recognised until this event has occurred and it is certain that the economic benefit triggered by this event will flow to the Group.
In cases where product is sold to a customer with a right of replacement, the Group views the transaction as a multi-element arrangement and a portion of the value from the sale is deferred and allocated to the replacement right based on the fair value of the replacement right.
Upfront and milestone payments Non-refundable upfront and milestone payments are deferred and recognised as the earnings process is completed.
Where the Group has performance obligations, upfront payments are deferred over the period in which these obligations are satisfied.
In determining the performance obligations under the contract, consideration is given as to whether elements of the obligations meet the criteria for separate accounting.
The Group applies the substantive milestone method in accounting for subsequent milestone payments.
Milestone payments that are considered substantive are recognised into income in the year in which they are received.
Milestones that do not satisfy the criteria to be considered as substantive are amortised over the remaining period in which the Group expects to fulfil its performance obligations under the agreement.
The Group considers the following when assessing whether a milestone is considered substantive: Are the milestone payments non-refundable?
Does the achievement of the milestone involve a degree of risk that was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement?
Is substantive effort involved in achieving the milestone?
Is the amount of the milestone payment reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone?
How does the time that passes between the payments compare to the effort required to reach the milestone?
Out-licensed product royalties Royalty income is generated by sales of products incorporating the Groups proprietary technology.
Royalty revenues are recognised once the amounts due can be reliably estimated based on the sale of underlying products and recoverability is assured.
Where there is insufficient historical data on sales and returns to fulfil these requirements, for example in the case of a new product, the royalty revenue will not be recognised until the Group can reliably estimate the underlying sales.
r Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure incurred on development projects relating to the design and testing of new or improved products is recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefit, considering factors including its commercial and technological feasibility, status of regulatory approval, and the ability to measure costs reliably.
Other development expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure previously recognised as an expense is not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development expenditure that has a finite useful life and which has been capitalised is amortised from the commencement of the commercial production of the product on a straight line basis over the period of its expected benefit.
No development expenditure has been capitalised in either the current or prior year.
Property, plant and equipment used for research and development is depreciated in accordance with the Groups policy.
s Cost of sales Cost of sales includes the direct costs incurred in manufacturing and bringing products to sale in the market and revenue sharing costs.
Revenue sharing costs represent amounts due to licensors or assignees of technology upon recognition by the Group of amounts due from a licensee.
They are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the individual agreements held with respect to the relevant technology in line with revenue recognition.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 80 80 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued t Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Such assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the length of the lease.
Assets purchased under hire purchase agreements are accounted for similarly, except that these assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
u Financial income Net financial income comprises interest income less interest payable during the year, calculated using the effective interest rate method, and fair value adjustments relating to foreign exchange forward contracts.
v Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiary undertakings to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying value of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
w BTG Employee Share Trust Included within the Groups financial results are those of the BTG Employee Share Trust, the costs of which are expensed within the financial statements of the Trust as incurred.
In the Company accounts the cost of BTG shares held by the Trust is deducted from shareholders funds.
x Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, described in note 2, management and the Audit Committee discussed and agreed the selection, application and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the accounts.
Revenue recognition As described in note 2, it is the Groups policy to recognise non-refundable upfront payments over the period in which any performance obligations are satisfied.
In December 2008, the Group acquired Protherics which had received 16,300,000 from AstraZeneca UK Ltd in a Patent and Know How Licence Agreement for CytoFab.
The Group considers that its obligations under the licence agreement consist of the licence, provision of development services, regulatory support and steering committee participation.
The Group considers that the development services and the regulatory support it can supply will cease with the approval of CytoFab by the FDA and while the steering committee continues to operate after product approval by the FDA, the Group has received confirmation that its participation after this date would become voluntary.
Based on the clinical development plan to be undertaken by AstraZeneca, the Group currently estimates that its performance under the agreement will be completed over the period to December 31, 2012 and, therefore, is recognising the 16,300,000 on a straight-line basis, over the estimated performance period.
In determining the revenue recognition period, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue per IAS 18, Revenue, and is satisfied that all requirements have been met by the Group.
Acquisitions Judgements have been made in respect of the identification of intangible assets made on acquisitions based on pre-acquisition forecasts, analysis and negotiations.
In addition to the judgements and estimates made in establishing the intangible assets acquired and their value, in certain instances, these assets are in development and are only amortised once the development phase has been completed, although these assets are subjected to impairment review in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 2 l. Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill or other intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
See note 2 l for further details.
Fair value of listed and unlisted investments Note 2 l explains the basis for estimating the fair value of listed and unlisted investments.
Pension assumptions Note 30 details the key actuarial assumptions used to establish the pension funding position.
These are the best estimates chosen based in historic experience and future expectations.
Should the discount rate used to establish scheme liabilities or the long-term expected rate of return on investment vary significantly then the pension fund valuation would be impacted.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 82 82 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY continued Carrying value of patents and other IPR Patents and other IPR with a carrying value of 165.8m are included in the financial statements.
The Group carries out twice yearly portfolio reviews to establish the economic value of each technology in the patent portfolio.
If the economic value of a technology is believed to be lower than the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced accordingly.
The economic value is based on estimated future income potential, taking into account technical and commercial risks.
The tests require an estimation of future marketability or value-in-use.
There is a risk that should these estimations require significant downward revision, there would be a material adverse impact on the income statement in any one year.

Excluding this amount, gross profit generated from acquired products in the period since acquisition was 6.9m.
5 BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups business and geographical segments with the primary format, business segments, being based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms-length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.
Business segments The Group comprises the following main business segments: Life sciences The acquisition, development and commercialisation of pharmaceutical and other medical technologies.
Technology commercialisation The commercialisation of technology outside the life sciences area.
Geographical segments The life sciences and technology commercialisation business segments are managed on a worldwide basis, but operate with customers in four principal geographical areas, these being the US, UK, Europe excluding UK and Asia.

1 Following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December 2008, the Group undertook a restructuring to integrate and align the two businesses.
The principal costs incurred relate to redundancy, property costs associated with onerous leases and impairment of assets made redundant as part of the restructuring.
The majority of costs will have been paid within a year of completion of the acquisition, although commitments on onerous leases extend for four years note 33.
The 10.9m total charge to the Income Statement arises in the Life Sciences business segment.
2 In the prior year, the Group reassessed the economics of the existing facility for the manufacture of products for Varisolve given the design improvements and outsourcing of the manufacturing process, which triggered an impairment review.
The Group made full provision against the carrying value of this asset.
This was done on the basis that the fair value less costs to sell of the asset was deemed to be nil.
In addition, a provision of 0.6m was made in relation to an onerous lease in respect of the Wrexham site.
This provision was triggered by the decision to exit the Wrexham facility.
The 8.1m total charge to the Income Statement in the prior year arose in the UK Life Sciences business segment.
9 AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF INVESTMENTS Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Amount written off investments 3.4 Following a review of the carrying values of its investments, the Group has recognised a write-off of 3.4m in relation to two investments.
The impairment has been triggered by the unprecedented recent market conditions, particularly for early stage biotechnology companies seeking to raise funds.
The impairments relate 3.2m to the Life Sciences business segment and 0.2m to Technology Commercialisation.

The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Deferred tax asset recognised at 1 April Acquisitions note 39 0.5 Income statement credit 0.1 Exchange differences 0.1 Deferred tax asset recognised at 31 March 0.7 The deferred tax asset, which relates to trading losses incurred in Australia, has been recognised in the financial statements following the development of the Groups products in prior years and the directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that the level of profits in Australia in the forthcoming years will lead to the realisation of this asset.
In addition to the losses on which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, the Group has additional taxable losses and other timing differences in the UK and the US which arose as a result of the research and development incurred during the start-up of the Groups activities.
These losses are available for offset against future taxable profits in these territories.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses and other temporary differences since there is uncertainty as to how quickly such losses and temporary differences would be utilised and consequently the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is uncertain.
The total amount of deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at 28% is approximately: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Tax losses 43.8 34.0 Deductible temporary differences 4.7 4.9 48.5 38.9 Deferred tax liabilities Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m At 1 April Acquisitions note 39 36.2 Utilised during the period 1.0 At 31 March 35.2 Deferred tax liabilities of 36.2m were recognised in relation to the acquired intangible assets.
This amount is over and above 18.2m of deferred tax assets in recognition of acquired accumulated tax losses.
No deferred tax has been recognised directly in equity.

Goodwill relates to one cash generating unit, being the Protherics business acquired on 4 December 2008 see note 39.
There has been no material change in the underlying value in use of the Protherics business assets acquired since the date of acquisition.
The impairment review required the estimation of the recoverable amount based on the value in use of the underlying cash generating unit.
Near-term projections are based on the Groups approved three-year plan.
Longer-term projections through to the end of an assets estimated useful economic life are included due to the long-term nature of pharmaceutical product development and product life cycles.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cashflows were based include market share and gross margin for the marketed products, individual probability-adjusted cashflow models for all in-process R&D and an assessment of the net present value of future net royalty income for licensed patents.
Cashflow projections for all assets were included for a period equal to the estimated useful economic life of the assets.
No terminal values were applied.
All cashflows were discounted back to present value using a pre-tax discount rate of between 10% for net royalty income and 24% for in-process R&D which takes into account the individual risk characteristics of each particular asset and related income stream.
For marketed products, near term sales projections are based on past experience, adjusting for expected changes in future conditions, including those anticipated as a result of our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
Long-term sales projections follow a well established sales profile for products in this industry.
For in-process R&D the key assumptions are the chance of product launch, market share and overall market size.
Industry average statistics are used to assess the chance of product launch, taking in to account the stage of development of the asset, the therapeutic area targeted and any known specific characteristics of the asset.
Market share and overall market size are assessed by reference to independent industry market reports.
In assessing whether there has been an impairment the net present value of future cashflows is compared to the carrying value in the accounts.

Impairment review intangible assets Note 17 contains details of the Groups impairment review which was conducted on goodwill and intangible assets as at 31 March 2009.
As a result of this review, impairment charges of 1.3m have been made against individual assets within Patents and other IPR as the assessed value in use was lower than the carrying value.
The impairment charge is included within operating expenses in the income statement.
In addition, 0.9m of impairment charges have been reflected through Reorganisation costs in the income statement as the impairments arose as a direct result of management decisions to limit future investment in certain in-process R&D assets following the acquisition of Protherics PLC and a subsequent detailed review of all in-process R&D assets within the Groups portfolio.
All impairment charges relate to the Life Sciences business segment.

Dilution of BTGs shareholding back below 50% resulted in a loss of 0.3m being recognised in the income statement in the prior year and a lower transfer value of the investment back into associates of 0.5m.
The Board of Mesophotonics was actively in negotiations with third parties for the sale of its key business assets at 31 March 2008.
For this reason the Groups investment in Mesophotonics was transferred to current assets as at that date and is within the technology commercialisation business segment.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange price.
The fair value of unlisted investments is estimated to be the valuation following the latest round of equity funding or cost if no valuation is available.
Where the fair value of an available-for-sale asset is impaired, the impairment charge is recognised in the income statement together with any amounts recycled from the fair value reserve see note 25.
These impairments initially arise from the prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further decline in fair value is immediately taken to the income statement.
During the year, 0.5m was recycled from the fair value reserve on the sale or impairment of investments.

30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Defined benefit scheme A funded defined benefit final salary pension scheme is in operation for all eligible staff of the Group.
Scheme funds are administered by trustees independently of the Group.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits accruing at the rate of one sixtieth or one eightieth of salary, dependent on the employees personal level of contribution, with a maximum of 40 years service.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme has a history of raising pensions in line with price inflation and these increases are reflected in the measurement of the obligation.
Following the simplification provisions of the Finance Act 2004, the Company and pension fund trustees decided to institute an earnings cap similar to that previously in place under HM Revenue & Customs Earnings Cap rules.
This took effect on 1 April 2006 and was based on the 105,600 cap in place at that time, increased annually by inflation the BTG Cap.
The BTG Cap for the year to 31 March 2009 was 117,600 and from 1 April 2009 has been set at 123,600.
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants as from 1 June 2004, although under certain conditions new employees may still join at the request of the Company.
At the same time, a review of benefits was carried out.
Following this review, employees in the defined benefit scheme were offered the opportunity to increase their contributions to 7% in order to retain the previous accrual rate of a sixtieth of pensionable salary up to the BTG Cap or to maintain their contribution rate at 5%, which would result in their future accrual rate reducing to an eightieth.
In addition, the pension payable is calculated on the average of the last three years salary rather than the final years salary as previously.
Past benefits were unaffected by this change.

This valuation was carried out by David Jones, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
The results of this valuation were updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19.
The Group agreed with the pension fund trustees to make special contributions to the fund.
In 08 09 the Group contributed an additional 4.2m and has also agreed to make additional contributions of approximately 3.3m pa for the next four years in order to improve the financial position of the scheme.
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid to the plan during 09 10 is 3.6m 08 09 actual: 5.0m.
The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ended 31 March 2009 was 5.5% pa 07 08: 5.5%.
This rate is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term rate of return on each of the asset classes in which the scheme was invested at 31 March 2009, based on the plans long-term investment strategy at that date.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used for the plan: 31 March 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 2007 % %% Retail price inflation 3.2% pa 3.7% pa 3.0% pa Discount rate 6.9% pa 6.5% pa 5.4% pa Pension increases in deferment 3.2% pa 3.7% pa 3.0% pa Pension increases in payment RPI 3.2% pa 3.7% pa 3.0% pa Pension increases in payment 2.5% LPI 2.2% pa 2.5% pa 2.2% pa General salary increases 4.2% pa 4.7% pa 4.6% pa Life expectancy at age 60 of a male age 60 at the accounting date 88.1 87.4 86.4 Life expectancy at age 60 of a male age 40 at the accounting date 90.3 88.8 86.4 The mortality assumptions used for the BTG pension fund are based on 90% of the rates in the new PNA00 mortality tables including medium cohort improvement factors 07 08: PA00, including medium cohort improvement factors.

The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective expected return on separate asset classes.
The expected rate of return on government bonds has been based on long-term yields at the accounting date.
For corporate bonds, the expected return has been based on long-term yields at the accounting date adjusted for the risk of default and downgrade in the future.
The long-term returns on equities are assumed to be 3.75% pa in excess of the expected returns on long dated gilts.
The actual return on scheme assets for the year was a loss of 2.9m 07 08: 4.5m.

Defined contribution scheme The Group offers defined contribution pension schemes both for its UK, US and Australian employees.
The total income statement charge in relation to these schemes was 0.8m 07 08: 0.2m.
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme, a new defined contribution scheme was offered to new entrants employed by an existing BTG Group company.
This was replaced by a Group Personal Pension Scheme as from 1 April 2006.
Members of the existing defined benefit final salary scheme may elect to transfer to this scheme.
The Group contributes between 3% and 10% of base salary up to the BTG Cap to this scheme, depending on seniority and levels of employee contribution.
Qualifying UK employees who were employed by Protherics and its subsidiaries benefit in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions made by the Group fully vesting, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of the forfeited contributions.
Eligible employees of the Groups overseas subsidiaries are members of externally operated defined contribution schemes.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these schemes is to make the specified contributions.
31 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Share options The Group makes awards under an equity-settled share option plan that entitles employees to purchase shares in the Company.
Grants have been made to employees on a number of occasions under the current plan since it was set up in 1998, subject to amendments made to the plan in 2001 and 2005.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, options are granted at the market price of the shares on the date of grant with a vesting period of generally three years.
They may only be exercised upon the attainment of certain performance criteria.
If the performance criteria are not met by the date specified at the time of grant, the options do not vest and will lapse.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest unless the conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered to be a good leaver.
In this case their options remain exercisable for a limited period of time.
For further details see the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 64.

Share options are granted under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition.
Service and non-market conditions are not taken into account in calculating the fair value measurement of the services received.
Performance shares are awarded under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition.
As explained in the Remuneration Report, certain of the share options and performance shares have a market-based performance condition, such that the Companys share price over the performance period will be compared with the performance of the techMARK All Share or FTSE SmallCap excluding Investment Trusts indices depending on the index chosen for the specific award on the date of grant.
If the Companys share price at least matches the performance of the relevant index over the vesting period, the market-based performance condition will be considered to have been achieved.
The fair value of an award of shares under the share option and performance share plans have been adjusted to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the relevant index and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price and index performance.
This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the share price at the date of grant.
Restricted shares are awarded to certain key management under a service condition and a non-market performance condition.
There are no market conditions related to the restricted share awards.

All options had vested at the point of acquisition and thus the Group has not experienced a share based payment charge in respect of these options.
Should these options be exercised, the newly issued shares in Protherics would be exchanged for shares in BTG plc at a ratio of 0.291 BTG plc ordinary share for each Protherics ordinary share.

34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES Overview The Group has exposure to credit, liquidity and market risks from its use of financial instruments.
This note sets out the Groups key policies and processes for managing these risks.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a licensee fails to meet its contractual obligations or a customer fails to pay for goods and services received.
The Groups primary objective with respect to credit risk is to minimise the risk of default by licensees or customers.
A substantial element of the Groups revenue is derived from royalties which are only payable if a licensee is generating income from sales of licensed products.
In such instances the Groups exposure to credit risk is considered to be inherently relatively low, although it is influenced by the unique characteristics of individual licensees.
Approximately 45% of the Groups recurring royalties are derived from one licensee who has held a licence for six years.
The Groups policy is to provide against bad debts on a specific licence by licence basis.
The majority of the product revenue is currently generated from sales to one customer in the US Management are constantly in communication with this customer and monitor both sales to and payments from this customer to minimise the credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group has limited debt facilities, in the form of assets held under finance leases and a small bank loan, but has substantial cash balance to fund its operations.
The Groups policy is to place surplus cash resources on short-term fixed interest deposits, to the extent that cash flow can be reasonably predicted.
Term deposits are denominated in UK sterling with institutions rated as A or higher by both Moodys and Standard & Poors.
7716 Accounts 2009. qxd 16 6 09 16:29 Page 111 111 BTG plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings in financial instruments.
The Group has little exposure to interest rate risk other than that returns on short term fixed interest deposits will vary with movements in underlying bank interest rates.
The Groups principal market risk exposure is to movements in foreign exchange rates.
Foreign currency risk The Group has several overseas subsidiary undertakings, the revenues and the expenses of which are denominated in local currencies, these being US$ and Australian dollars A$.
As a result, the Groups sterling income statement, balance sheet and cashflows may be affected by movements in sterling exchange rates with these currencies.
The Groups primary objective with respect to managing foreign exchange risk is to provide certainty over the value of future cashflows.
A significant element of the Groups revenue is denominated in US$ with the remainder split between sterling, euros, yen and other currencies.
The majority of the Groups operating expenses are in sterling along with smaller elements in US$ and A$.
Where possible, anticipated foreign currency operating expenses are matched to foreign currency revenues.
The excess exposure over and above this natural hedge, to the extent that cash flows are predictable, is managed using forward contracts see note 27.
Sensitivity analysis A 5% weakening of the US$ at 31 March 2009 would have resulted in increased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below: 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Profit or loss 0.5 0.3 Equity 0.9 Interest rate risk The Group seeks to mitigate partially against increased interest rates whilst maintaining a degree of flexibility to benefit from decreasing rates of interest by holding a mix of fixed and floating rate financial liabilities.
The Group seeks to maximise the amount of interest income from its cash balances by using a variety of short-term, fixed high-interest deposit and money-market accounts Market price risk It is, on occasion, deemed appropriate to take equity stakes in early-stage companies utilising the Groups technology as part of the overall licensing arrangement and small loans may be granted to these companies to further technology development.
These investments will be realised at an appropriate time in the development cycle.
Regular reports are made to the Board on the status of investments.
These investments form part of the Groups overall technology portfolio and do not materially affect liquidity.

The Groups objectives when managing capital are: To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for inventive sources and returns to investors.
To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Groups capital and equity ratio are shown in the table below.

Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, short term deposits, foreign currency forward contracts and various items such as trade debtors and creditors which arise directly from operations.
In addition, a number of debt and equity investments, both quoted and unquoted as shown in notes 20 and 21, are held in technology-based companies along with borrowings including obligations under finance leases.

The Group recognised a fair value loss of 4.9m 07 08: loss of 0.5m relating to forward foreign exchange contracts within Net financing expense.
0.5m of previously recognised fair value losses were recycled from the fair value reserve within equity in relation to investments sold or impaired during the year.
During 07 08 0.3m fair value losses were recognised within equity in relation to investments held at fair value.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.
Other investments These comprise both listed and unlisted investments, available-for-sale.
The figure recorded in the balance sheet is the best estimate of fair value.
Borrowings These consist of bank and other loans along with obligations under finance leases.
The fair values of such balances are estimated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
Trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents Trade payables and receivables have a remaining life of less than one year so their value recorded in the balance sheet is considered to be a fair approximation of fair value.
35 OPERATING LEASES Total non-cancellable operating lease rentals are due in the following periods: 31 March 2009 31 March 2008 Vehicles, Vehicles, plant and plant and Property equipment Property equipment m m m m Within one year 2.1 2.6 Between two and five years 4.3 1.1 After five years 6.4 3.7 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable for certain of its office properties, plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Vehicle, plant and equipment leases have lease terms between one and five years with no option to extend nor purchase at expiry of the lease period.
The Group leases varying offices and facilities in London, Runcorn, Philadelphia, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Australia.
These leases have terms of between one month and five years with the exception of certain leases in London where the Group has exercised a break clause on two of its leases and these two leases expire in the forthcoming year.
The leases in Nashville, Salt Lake City, Australia and London contain options to extend for a further three, three, five and five years respectively.
In the event of renewal, the lease contracts contain market review clauses.
None of the property leases provide the Group with an option to purchase the leased asset at the expiry of the lease period.
