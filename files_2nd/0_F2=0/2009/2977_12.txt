Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group are made up to the Saturday nearest to 30 April.
The financial year for 2009 represents the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2009.
The comparative financial year for 2008 was 53 weeks ended 3 May 2008.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share-based payments which are measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Where applicable comparative amounts have been restated to conform with current presentation.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal respectively.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Exchange differences The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the opening rate for the month in which the transaction occurs which is used as a reasonable approximation to the rate at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the period except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge when they are recognised in equity.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rate during the period.
Differences on translation are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative exchange differences for that operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Segment reporting A geographical segment has operations within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group recognises only geographical segments as the business operation is the same throughout the Group.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services to customers outside the Group net of returns, sales allowances and value added and other sales based taxes.
Revenue from goods and services is recognised at the point the Group fulfils its commercial obligations to the customer, the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and collectability is reasonably assured.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the vesting period.
34 Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 1 Principal accounting policies continued Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is an indication of impairment the recoverable amount of either the asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is estimated.
Cash-generating units are used where an individual asset does not generate cash flows which are independent of other assets.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date.
Other operating income Rental income earned on investment property is recognised, in other operating income, in accordance with the substance of the relevant rental agreements.
Profits or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts except where payment or completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange.
Non-recurring items Transactions which are material by virtue of their size or incidence such as major reorganisation costs and impairments are disclosed as non-recurring items.
Tax Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted.
Tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity, otherwise it is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Purchased brand names and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Acquired software licences and software development costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the cost of the asset, on a straight-line basis, over its expected useful life.
The expected useful lives generally applicable are: Brands 20 years Computer software 7 years Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 35 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment, on a straight-line basis, to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimates useful lives and residual values of assets are reviewed annually.
The estimated useful lives by asset category that are generally applicable are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful life Fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years Computers 5 to 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 7 to 10 years Borrowing costs Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects are capitalised until the time that they are available for use.
Unless a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset interest is capitalised using the weighted average interest rate of all non-specific borrowings.
Where a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset interest is capitalised at the rate applicable to that borrowing.
Investment property Property that is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation is separately disclosed as investment property.
Investment property is carried at depreciated historical cost.
Depreciation rates and useful lives of investment property are the same as those for Property, plant and equipment.
Leasing commitments Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in fixed assets and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the period of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are released to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investment in subsidiaries The Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is recognised at cost and is accounted for net of impairment losses.
Income from investments is recognised in the income statement to the extent that post-acquisition profits are received.
Distributions of preacquisition profits reduce the cost of the investment.
Investments in joint ventures Joint ventures are established through an interest in a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark down and shrinkage based on actual losses, ageing of inventories and sales trends.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the inventory to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted to the amount receivable or payable.
Receivables are stated net of a provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and highly liquid investments.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts which are shown within borrowings and overdrafts in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
36 Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 1 Principal accounting policies continued Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate model.
Provisions A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are calculated on a discounted basis when appropriate.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and also participates in a multi-employer pension scheme in respect of its employees in The Netherlands.
The assets and liabilities of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme and, therefore, accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The net retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in equity in the period in which they occur and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other income and expenses associated with the defined benefit scheme are recognised in the income statement.
The pension cost of defined contribution schemes is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
In accordance with its Treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are stated at their fair value.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the asset or liability for the hedged transaction is recognised in the balance sheet, the associated gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.
Gains or losses realised on cash flow hedges are then recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.
Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 37 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Critical estimates and judgements continued Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Retirement benefits The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions.
New standards and interpretations Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group in 2008 09 The following interpretations became effective in these financial statements but had no impact on the Groups results: IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities for instance options over a Parents shares should be accounted for as equity settled or cash settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the Parent and Group companies.
This interpretation does not have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
The Companys accounting policy for share-based compensation arrangements is already in compliance with the interpretation.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements is not relevant to the Group.
New standards and interpretations of existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group At 2 May 2009 the following new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards, which are expected to be relevant to the Group and have an impact on the financial statements, were issued but not yet effective: IAS 1 revised, Presentation of Financial Statements, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard requires non-owner changes in equity to be shown in either one performance statement the statement of comprehensive income or two statements the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income.
Owner changes in equity will be shown in a statement of changes in equity.
Restatements or reclassifications of comparative information will require an additional restated balance sheet as at the beginning of the comparative period.
This will be applied in the Groups 2009 10 financial statements.
IAS 23 amendment, Borrowing Costs, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendment requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of the asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
There will be no impact on the Group or Companys financial statements as borrowing costs on qualifying assets are already capitalised under the allowed alternative treatments in the existing IAS 23.
IFRS 2 amendment, Share-based Payment, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features that are not vesting conditions will need to be included in the grant date fair value.
All cancellations, whether by the Group or by other parties, will receive the same accounting treatment.
This will be applied to the Groups 2009 10 financial statements.
The impact is not expected to be significant.
IFRS 3 revised, Business Combinations, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The revised standard harmonises business combination accounting with US GAAP.
The standard will continue to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with certain significant changes.
All payments to purchase a business will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through income.
Goodwill and noncontrolling interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis.
All transaction costs will be expensed.
This is still subject to endorsement by the EU but is expected to be applied in the Groups 2010 11 financial statements.
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segmental reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that being used for internal reporting purposes.
38 Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 2 Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting segment is geographic, as this is the basis on which the Group is both organised and managed.
The Group does not report a secondary segment on the basis of business operations because business operations throughout the Group are the same.
The geographical sectors are: United Kingdom & Republic of Ireland UK & RoI, and The Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and the joint venture arrangement in Germany Rest of Europe.
Central costs are incurred principally in the UK and are immaterial.
As such these costs are included within the UK & RoI segment.
Segment revenue, expense, result, assets and liabilities include transfers between geographical segments.
Such transfers are priced at arms-length and are eliminated on consolidation.

During the year the Executive Directors realised gains totalling 0.1 million on the vesting of the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2008: 0.1 million.
Details of these gains, share options and other Directors remuneration are disclosed in the Directors remuneration report on pages 24 to 29, which form part of these financial statements.
5 Share-based payments Included within administrative expenses is 0.1 million 2008: nil in respect of equity-settled share-based payments.
The Groups employee share schemes are described below and additional detail is disclosed in the Directors remuneration report on pages 24 to 29.
Scheme participants are either Directors of the Company or employees of the Group.
The costs associated with the schemes are accounted for in the Companys accounts.
i LTIP Under this scheme participants may receive annual awards in the form of contingent entitlements to Company shares.
These entitlements are equity-settled through the purchase of existing shares by the administering Trust.
The shares vest three years after award if participants remain with the Group during the vesting period and the Group meets targeted levels of total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth.
The performance conditions are fully described in the Directors remuneration report in the section titled Long-Term Incentive Plan.
During the period contingent entitlements to nil shares were awarded 2008: nil.
The charge recognised in the income statement in respect of all LTIP awards is 0.1 million 2008: a credit of 0.1 million.
The fair values of the awards are determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model which takes account of the performance conditions described in the preceding paragraph.
The fair value per share is based on the expected number of shares that will vest.
LTIP shares do not earn dividends during the vesting period.
The Groups LTIP is administered by the Equity Trust Guernsey Limited which holds Company shares that will be used to satisfy the LTIP award.
These shares are classified as treasury shares in accordance with IAS 32.

ii Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE Three and five year SAYE schemes were introduced in 2004.
Employees and Executive Directors are invited to subscribe for options over shares in the Company at a 20% discount.
The options are exercisable within six months from the third or fifth anniversary of the grant date.
The entitlement to share options is equity-settled.
Funds for the purchase of Company shares are built up through the contribution of a maximum of 250 per month from salary.
During the period options were granted over 732,573 shares in respect of a three year and five year award exercisable between April and October 2012, and April and October 2014 respectively.
The 2009 tranche of share options are exercisable at 295 pence per share 2008: 618 pence per share.
There are no vesting conditions other than continued employment with the Group until the respective exercise dates.

This increase arises primarily from the removal of the prior year credit relating to the restatement of deferred tax following the UK tax rate change from 30% to 28%, and the recognition of historic overseas tax losses as a deferred tax asset, together with the disproportionate effect of permanently disallowable items on the reduced level of profit.

Subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the proposed dividend will be paid on 25 September 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 11 September 2009.

Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 45 Notes to the accounts continued 10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by Equity Trust Guernsey Limited see Note 5 which are treated as cancelled.
In order to compute diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary shares.
Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the period, represent potentially dilutive Ordinary shares.

Instead it is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Other intangibles are amortised and also tested for impairment when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill impairment, intangible amortisation and impairment and reversals thereof are recognised in full in administrative expenses in the income statement during the period in which they are identified.
Goodwill comprises purchased goodwill in respect of the Ben fide Graaff and Sleepright businesses in the current year, 4.5 million 5.6 million and 2.9 million respectively, Carpetworld in March 2008, 6.9 million, Storeys in May 2007, 15.3 million, the Mays business in June 2005, 4.7 million, and The Netherlands and Belgian businesses valued in Euros in 2002, 20.1 million.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units to which it relates.
Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations are based on 10 year profit projections, the same period used by the Group for appraising the potential of business acquisitions, adjusted for non-cash items, planned working capital movements and capital expenditure.
The cash flow projections for the initial three year period are based on financial budgets and plans approved by the Board.
The key drivers are like-for-like sales growth, gross margin percentage and anticipated cost inflation.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated at a constant growth rate of 2.5% 2008: 2.5%.
The growth rate is in line with long-term growth rates of the countries in which the Group operates.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.6% 2008: 10.8% and is based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks of the businesses acquired.
Based on these calculations goodwill is not impaired.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate would not change the outcome of these calculations.
An increase of 3% in the discount rate would be required before any material impairment of goodwill would be indicated.
Interest capitalised in the prior year amounted to 0.9 million using an average rate of 6.1%.

The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2005 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 91% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Storeys scheme is also closed to new members and the assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in independently managed funds The most recent actuarial review of the Storeys scheme was at 1 March 2005.
The Storeys scheme has no active members.
The numbers set out below are the aggregate of the two schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 2 May 2009 by a qualified actuary.
1 Key assumptions used: 2009 2008 % % Expected rate of salary increases 3.7 4.3 Expected rate of pension increases 2.9 3.5 Discount rate 6.8 6.5 Expected rate of inflation 2.9 3.5 Expected return on scheme assets 6.7 6.9 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions used for future life expectancy of members of the scheme are derived from industry dates and standard tables.
Specifically the S1NMA table 2008: PMA 92 table with medium cohort improvement has been used for male pensioners and the S1NFA table 2008: PFA 92 table with medium cohort improvement for female pensioners projected by year of birth.
The most significant assumptions are the expected return on scheme assets, salary increases and the discount rate, of which the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate.
If this assumption increased or decreased by 0.1% the defined benefit obligation would change by 0.2 million 2008: 0.2 million.

58 Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 24 Retirement benefit obligations continued b Multi-employer scheme The Groups Dutch subsidiary participates in a multi-employer run industry pension scheme which has arrangements similar to those of a defined benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the Groups share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme, and therefore in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.
Under the terms of the scheme the scheme deficit is recovered through increased contributions from participating members.
At the period end the Group was unable to obtain a valuation of the industry schemes full surplus or deficit.
Contributions charged to the income statement amounted to 1.1 million 2008: 0.7 million.
ii Defined contribution schemes With effect from 31 March 2006 the Company closed a defined contribution pension scheme to further contributions.
Contributions made up until that date by employees were matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by the National Provident Institution.
No Company contributions were made to this scheme in the current or previous period.
The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan GPP Plan in April 2006.
Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by Scottish Life.
Contributions for the period amounted to 0.8 million 2008: 0.8 million.
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and The Netherlands.
The Group makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by local insurance companies.
The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of nil 2008: nil and contributions to industry collective schemes were 0.1 million 2008: 0.1 million.
25 Financial instruments i Financial risk management objectives and policies Risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Groups operations include trade receivables and payables.
Exposure to credit, liquidity, foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business operations and each of these risks are managed in accordance with the Groups treasury risk management strategy, which is also discussed in the Business Review in the section Management of Liquidity and Financing.
a Credit risk The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, the majority of which relates to retail customers see Note 17.
Retail customers are required to settle outstanding balances in cash or using a major credit card prior to goods being collected from delivered by the store.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with a minimum AA credit rating.
The maximum amount of credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of financial assets.
Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 59 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Financial instruments continued b Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through term loans, revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with the Groups bankers at commercial rates.
All counterparties have an investment graded rating.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest Less than Between one Between two Over one year and two years and five years five years Total m m m m m Group At 2 May 2009 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 18.5 9.9 82.2 110.6 Finance leases 0.9 0.2 0.2 2.6 3.9 Trade and other payables 94.4 94.4 113.8 10.1 82.4 2.6 208.9 At 3 May 2008 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 22.4 4.5 33.4 1.4 61.7 Finance leases 0.8 0.9 0.3 2.7 4.7 Trade and other payables 99.4 99.4 122.6 5.4 33.7 4.1 165.8 Company At 2 May 2009 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 6.9 9.9 79.5 96.3 Finance leases 0.9 0.2 0.2 1.6 2.9 Trade and other payables 79.6 79.6 87.4 10.1 79.7 1.6 178.8 At 3 May 2008 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 11.5 3.1 32.0 46.6 Finance leases 0.8 0.9 0.3 1.7 3.7 Trade and other payables 84.1 84.1 96.4 4.0 32.3 1.7 134.4 Committed overdraft facilities are renewable annually and amounts undrawn were 10.0m and8.7 million 2008: 26.5 million and 10.6 million.
During the year the Company completed a refinancing with the principal bankers which provides committed facilities to July 2012.
These facilities comprise a 33.0 million term loan, a23.5 million term loan and a 45.0 million revolving credit facility.
There are a number of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates of fixed charge cover, leverage and cash flow cover.
The company is and is expected to remain in compliance with these covenants.
The revolving credit facility had an undrawn amount of 5.0 million 2008: 5.0 million.
The Group are in the process of renegotiating financing agreements with its other bankers to align the covenant requirements with those of the principal bankers.
60 Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 25 Financial instruments continued c Foreign exchange risk Outside the UK the Group operates in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium and Poland.
Revenues and expenses of these operations are denominated in Euros or Zlotys.
The Groups investment in Poland is currently not sufficiently material to require the risk to be hedged.
The Group mitigates currency risk in respect of the net investment in European operations by designating Euro denominated borrowings as hedging instruments of Euro denominated investments in foreign operations.
If the closing Sterling-Euro rate had been 0.01 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE would have been 0.4 million higher 2008: 0.2 million lower.
At 2 May 2009 if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the Euro profit after tax for the year would have been 0.2 million higher lower as a result of the translation of the Euro denominated businesses.
If the closing Sterling-Zloty rate had been 0.2 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the SORIE would have been 0.1 million lower 2008: 0.2 million.
Financial assets and liabilities and foreign operations are translated at the following rates of exchange: Euro Euro Zloty Zloty 2009 2008 2009 2008 Average rate 1.19 1.40 4.53 5.25 Closing rate 1.12 1.28 4.89 4.42 d Interest rate risk The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.
Group policy is to manage interest rate risk by purchasing interest rate swap agreements to hedge at least 75% of term loans.
The remaining 25% is liable to interest at prevailing interest rates.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of hedging instruments in place at 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 respectively.
Consequently analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 1: cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.4 million 2008: 0.1 million.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group, after the impact of interest rate swaps is as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted average average effective Floating Fixed Interest effective Floating Fixed Interest interest rate rate rate free Total interest rate rate rate free Total % m m m m % m m m m Sterling 3.1 10.6 8.3 18.9 8.1 8.1 Euro 0.5 6.3 1.9 8.2 0.5 8.6 4.5 13.1 Zloty 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2 Total financial assets 17.4 10.2 27.6 8.8 12.6 21.4 Sterling 2.7 22.9 56.2 75.6 154.7 1.4 31.4 4.7 86.8 122.9 Euro 3.5 18.6 16.8 17.9 53.3 3.2 11.1 19.2 12.1 42.4 Zloty 0.9 0.9 0.5 0.5 Total financial liabilities 41.5 73.0 94.4 208.9 42.5 23.9 99.4 165.8 Capital management The Group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining an appropriate debt equity capital structure.
It uses a number of mechanisms to manage debt equity levels, as appropriate, in the light of economic and trading conditions and the future capital investment requirements of the business.
Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 61 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Financial instruments continued ii Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are classified in accordance with IAS 39.
Financial instruments have not been reclassified or derecognised in the period.
There are no financial assets which have been pledged or held as collateral.
None of the Groups loans are impaired.
In addition the Group does not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement other than derivatives.
There are no available-for-sale financial assets.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with their carrying amounts are: Group 2009 Group 2008 Company 2009 Company 2008 Carrying Carrying Carrying Carrying Nominal and fair Nominal and fair Nominal and fair Nominal and fair value value value value value value value value m m m m m m m m At cost: Cash and cash equivalents 17.4 8.9 10.5 3.2 Loans and receivables at amortised cost: Trade and other receivables 10.2 12.5 68.7 56.4 Derivative financial instruments used for hedging: Interest rate swaps 19.1 19.1 Total financial assets 27.6 19.1 21.4 79.2 19.1 59.6 Financial liabilities at amortised cost: Borrowings and overdrafts 108.3 61.7 94.0 46.6 Finance lease obligations 3.9 4.7 2.9 3.7 Derivative financial instruments used for hedging: Interest rate swaps 66.8 2.3 66.8 2.3 Financial liabilities at cost: Trade and other payables 94.4 99.4 79.6 84.1 Total financial liabilities 66.8 208.9 165.8 66.8 178.8 134.4 Net financial liabilities 66.8 181.3 19.1 144.4 66.8 99.6 19.1 74.8 Determination of fair values The fair values of derivatives are estimated using future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted discount rates based on market yield curves.
The carrying values of all other financial assets and liabilities are deemed to reflect fair value.
iii Derivative financial instruments The Group has various Euro and Sterling-denominated borrowings which bear interest at floating rates.
Interest on the Sterling borrowing is charged at LIBOR plus a margin.
The Euro-denominated borrowings bear interest at the prevailing EURIBOR rate plus a margin.
Interest rate swaps were purchased to fix approximately 65% of the floating interest charges due within the next three years at fixed rates of interest ranging from 3.21% to 5.25% 2008: 3.19% to 4.55%.
The maturity profiles of the interest rate swaps match that of the underlying hedged borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments are not purchased for speculative purposes.

Hedge documentation is put in place at inception of all hedging relationships.
Effectiveness tests are performed at each reporting date.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
Changes in fair value are posted to equity in respect of the portion of the hedges which satisfy the criteria to be effective hedges.
Charges or credits relating to the portion which does not satisfy these criteria are recognised directly in the income statement.
Cash flows in respect of the interest rate swaps are generally expected to occur at the same dates as the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
b Net investment hedges Euro-denominated borrowings are designated as hedging instruments of Euro-denominated net assets of the Groups foreign operations in order to protect the Group from currency risk in respect of the Groups Euro-denominated foreign operations.
Borrowing balances are carried at amortised cost which approximates fair value since borrowings bear interest at the prevailing floating rate.
The carrying value of borrowings amounted to23.5 million 2008:13.2 million.
