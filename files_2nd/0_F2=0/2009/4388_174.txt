Reserves and resources above are quoted on a working interest basis rounded to the nearest mmbbl, bcf, or mmboe as appropriate.
2009 Proven plus Probable reserves and contingent resources have been assessed by the Companys internal reservoir engineers, utilising data available from operators and other sources.
The Companys properties have also been audited by a recognised Competent Person in accordance with the definition of proven and probable reserves applicable to mineral companies primarily involved in the extraction of oil and gas resources as set out in Appendix 1.1 to the UKLA Listing Rules.
Contingent resources relate to technically recoverable hydrocarbons for which commerciality has not yet been determined and are stated on a best estimate basis.
Quantities of oil equivalent are calculated using a gas-to-oil conversion factor of 5,800 scf of gas per barrel of oil equivalent.
Reserves from the sole risked discoveries at Lewis and Harris formerly West Rinnes & East Rinnes are included above, based on 100% equity ownership.
Cieco, as a joint-venture partner, have a right to recover their equity position in exchange for a contractual payment which would reduce Danas equity interest in these reserves to 64.83%.
