This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of subsidiary undertakings.
Included in the Companys trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of nil 2008: 23,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Company has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
No allowance for doubtful debts are considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 65,515,000 2008: 76,839,000 comprise cash held by the Company and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

Share based payments During the year ended 31 March 2009, the Company had five 2008: five share based payment arrangements, which are described below: i Executive Share Option Plan ESOP The ESOP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period.
In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependent upon a share price target.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
ii 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan KEIP The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
The number of awards vesting is dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ending 31 March 2009 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2010.
iii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP provides for the grant of nil cost options.
The vesting period is between three and five years and is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant performace period.
iv Deferred Bonus Plan DBP The Deferred Bonus Plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company.
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper decile performance.
The shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
v Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount.
The options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 14.68 2008: 18.70.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 121 The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan.
The assumptions used in the models are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 20% - 30% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 3.8% - 5.2% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

Financial instruments Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Company from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows: cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities trade receivables inter-company receivables and payables trade payables All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management The Company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 50, cash and cash equivalents and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 54, 57 and 58.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Company manages as capital: 2009 2008 000 000 Shareholders funds 201,020 234,060 Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities 10,515 13,161 Financial risk management objectives The Companys principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
The Company also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The Companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Companys long term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Companys policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 123 The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.

It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
At 31 March 2009 the Company had in place an interest rate swap to hedge loans subject to variable interest rates linked to LIBOR whereby it receives a floating rate of interest based on one month LIBOR on a notional principal of 50m 2008: 50m and pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.9% 2008: 4.9%.
The remaining term of the interest rate swap is one year.
The fair value of the interest rate swap at 31 March 2009 was 1,947,000 liability 2008: nil.
The timing of the impact on the income statement of the swap is up to one year from the balance sheet date.
The impact of the cash flow hedge on the income statement will be expensed through the finance cost line.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

It is the Companys policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash and cash equivalents the Companys exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Company manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Company has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Companys Board which sets the framework for the management of the Companys short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 23 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Company and the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
All of the Companys financial liabilities are due for payment within one year, based on contractual payment terms.
It is not practicable to re-present this information for 2005, 2006 and 2007.
