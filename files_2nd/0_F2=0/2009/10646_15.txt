3 Exceptional items Group 2009 2008 000 000 1 Restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in the Middle East 21,008 2 Restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in Management Consulting 4,740 3 Restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in Rail 24,267 4 Net profit on disposal of freehold property 3,814 5 Integration and transition costs 5,811 Other costs 988 6 Amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations 7,361 5,651 Total exceptional items 53,562 12,450 Management use underlying profit to measure and manage the financial performance of the Group on a day-to-day basis.
Underlying profit excludes material income and charges considered to be one off or non-recurring in nature.
Underlying profit also excludes the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations.
The Group presents these items as exceptional in a separate column in the Income Statement so that the underlying and statutory performance can be seen clearly.
During the second half of 2009 the Group has been impacted by a small number of significant events which have resulted in one off or non-recurring items: 1 The economic slowdown in Dubai required the Group to significantly reduce its presence in the region.
As a result, the Group incurred restructuring charges of 6.0m, mainly in respect of redundancies and surplus property provisions.
The Group has also recorded asset impairment charges of 15.0m to reduce the value of contract receivables to the amounts the Group believes it should be able to collect.
2 Restructuring costs and asset impairment charges were incurred in the second half of 2009 to better align demand and supply for the Groups management consulting services in the current environment.
3 During 2009 the Group decided to substantially withdraw from the rail sector.
The Group has incurred restructuring charges of 7.2m, mainly in respect of redundancies and surplus property provisions, and has impaired in full the intangible assets mainly goodwill and customer relationships associated with the Rail business of 17.1m.
4 The Group completed the sale of its freehold property and relocated staff and equipment prior to completion to new leasehold premises in Woking.
5 The integration and transition costs arose as a result of the acquisition of HBS Business Services Group Limited renamed Mouchel Business Services Limited MBS and Hedra plc renamed Mouchel Management Consulting Limited MMCL.
The integration of MBS and MMCL has resulted in a small number of staff redundancies, the closure of a loss making business and other transition costs.
6 In line with market practice, the Group does not consider the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations to be part of the underlying business performance and therefore treats them as exceptional costs.
The tax effect of the exceptional items is a credit of 10,916,000 in the Income Statement.
This credit, which is at a lower rate than the standard rate of corporation tax, reflects disallowed costs principally relating to the Rail intangible assets impairment charge and the effect of capital gains tax on the disposal of the freehold property.

Diluted loss earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all dilutive share options in issue and shares under Save As You Earn schemes.
The share price used to calculate diluted earnings per share is based on a weighted average price of 296.47p 31 July 2008: 428.13p.
Potential ordinary shares are not treated as dilutive when their conversion would increase earnings per share or decrease loss per share from continuing operations.
As the Group reported a loss for the year the effects of 493,000 anti-dilutive share options were ignored when calculating earnings per share for 2009.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated after adding back shares held by the employee share trusts to the weighted average number of shares.
Earnings are adjusted to exclude exceptional items net of taxation.
The Directors believe that this additional measure provides a better indicator of the underlying trends in the business.

The adjustments are not considered sufficiently material to restate comparative figures.
Goodwill created upon the acquisition of ServiGroup plc was impaired following the decision to substantially exit the rail sector.

A segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2009 2008 Government Regulated Government Regulated Services Industries Highways Total Services Industries Highways Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 United Kingdom 80,718 11,094 17,905 109,717 76,895 23,321 17,905 118,121 The recoverable amount of goodwill for each CGU has been based on value-in-use as represented by the net present value of future cash flows.
Cash flows are projected forwards for four years based on the latest one-year budget extrapolated for three future years, assuming operating margins remain the same, by a prudent growth rate applicable to each unit: an appropriate terminal value based on a perpetuity calculation using long-term average growth rates is then added.
They are then discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the Groups nominal weighted average cost of capital.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 10.0% per annum which has been applied consistently across each CGU based on their similar risk profiles.
As at 31 July 2009, based on these internal valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment.
They include costs associated with replacing the Groups management reporting systems.
Customer relationships brought forward have a useful life of between seven and 13 years.
The approximate remaining lives of these relationships are between seven and 11 years.
The values of these relationships were arrived at by discounting attributable future cash flows.
A discount rate of between 10% and 13% was used as appropriate, based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired entity.
A customer attrition rate of between 7% and 15% was assumed.
Software costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
All amortisation charges in the year have been charged through administrative expenses.
Additions of internally generated software include 445,000 of interest capitalised at an average borrowing rate of 5.5%.
Other intangibles comprise non-compete agreements, specialist software acquired and a licence for the Contractors Assurance Case CAC which enables us to work on UK railways.
The CAC has been impaired during the year.
The software was valued on a replacement cost basis and is amortised over five years.
The values of the non-compete agreements were calculated using discounted cash flows on two base cases: one assuming employees did compete and comparing that with the values obtained if employees did not compete.
Their useful lives are between two and three years: the same timespan as the non-compete agreement is enforceable for.
The CAC was originally valued on a replacement case basis.
Assets in the course of construction and software are internally generated.
Intangible assets created upon the acquisition of ServiGroup plc were impaired following the Groups decision to substantially exit the rail sector.
Depreciation in the year on those assets was 187,000 2008: 246,000.
All assets held under finance leases are categorised as plant and office equipment.

The Company receivables had nil provisions for impairment in both the current and prior years.
As at 31 July 2009, trade receivables and unbilled revenue of 42,424,000 2008: 40,052,000 were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: Group 2009 2008 000 000 Up to three months 22,327 28,184 Over three months 20,097 11,868 42,424 40,052 Included within trade receivables is 391,000 which is due after more than one year 2008: 542,000.
As at 31 July 2009 trade receivables and unbilled revenue of 20,040,000 2008: 2,635,000 have been impaired so as to reduce the value of contract receivables to the amounts the Group believes it should be able to collect.
This includes the impairment charge of 15.0m made against receivables in Dubai, as explained in note 3.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: Group 2009 2008 000 000 Up to three months 76 Over three months 20,040 2,559 20,040 2,635 Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables and unbilled revenue are as follows: Group 2009 2008 000 000 At 1 August 2,635 1,938 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectable 2,903 529 New impairment provisions made 20,308 882 Acquisitions 344 At 31 July 20,040 2,635 No amounts of collateral are held as security.
The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in administrative expenses in the Income Statement.
Amounts charged to the provisions account are generally written off when there is no expectation of cash recovery.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
18 Assets held for sale In the prior year the Group agreed to sell the freehold property and completion took place in March 2009.

The Group has entered into agreements to partially hedge against the interest rate risk on the revolving credit facility above.
At 31 July 2009, the total fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a liability of 4,362,000 2008: asset of 337,000.
The Group has complied with the banking facility covenants during the year.

Group Financial Statements 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 79 Mouchel Group plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2009 continued 23 Financial instruments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk in varying degrees but all have relatively low levels of risk.
Interest rate risk arises from long-term pounds sterling borrowings issued at variable rates.
Group policy is to hedge a proportion of the drawn revolving credit facility.
The Group has not undertaken hedging or complex financial instruments to mitigate risk other than interest rate risk.
Details of the Groups financial risk management objectives and policies are provided in note 1u.
The financial instruments of the Group comprise bank loan facilities, internal cash resources and trade receivables and payables arising from trading activities.
The Groups policy is to manage the financial instruments centrally to provide both the working capital and the investment funds necessary for ongoing operations and future development.
The majority of UK projects and contracts are in pounds sterling, and otherwise are in the currencies in which the majority of the costs are denominated.
The Groups principal overseas subsidiaries have arranged working capital facilities in their local currency and it is unusual for them to contract in currencies other than their own functional currency.
Consideration is given to hedging against possible currency movements where considered appropriate.
It is the Groups policy not to trade in derivatives.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
None were identified as part of the review.

Cash flow hedges are recognised in accordance with the provisions governing fair value hedge accounting: that is at amortised cost less the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk.
Their fair values are determined using valuation techniques which use data from observable markets, and assumptions are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.

The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 July shows payable amounts as follows: Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total At 31 July 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate: Other loans 1,171 736 103 2,010 Obligations under finance leases 153 127 280 Floating rate: Bank borrowings 982 10,000 10,000 132,758 153,740 Cash in hand 52,426 52,426 Cash flow hedges 4,362 4,362 Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total At 31 July 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate: Other loans 1,165 1,171 736 103 3,175 Obligations under finance leases 179 173 127 479 Floating rate: Bank borrowings 47,500 86,240 133,740 Cash in hand 51,792 51,792 Cash flow hedges 337 337 Group Financial Statements 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 81 Mouchel Group plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2009 continued 23 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Effect on profit Increase in before tax basis points 000 2009 0.25 384 2008 0.25 334 Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.
In these operations, the working capital facilities are maintained in local currency with funds being remitted back to the UK to minimise exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hedge against foreign currency exchange risk as balances in foreign currency are not significant to the Group.
The extent of foreign currency exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.
All bonds and guarantees are funded out of the UK.
At 31 July 2009, if the euro had weakened strengthened by 1% against the UK pound with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 18,000 2008: 22,000 lower higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of UK pound-denominated trade receivables.
At 31 July 2009 if the UAE dirham had weakened strengthened by 1% against the UK pound with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 19,000 2008: 22,000 lower higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of UK pound-denominated trade receivables.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and unbilled revenue.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The Group manages these risks through a number of measures.
Counterparty risk on cash deposits is managed by adhering to the guidelines set by the Board.
Currently the limits are that up to 5,000,000 of cash can be deposited with any one UK counterparty.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are managed through set-up and authorisation policies for new customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
An assessment of credit quality of the customer is made as appropriate taking into account their financial position, past experience, external agency ratings and other factors.
Where possible, the risk is mitigated by use of advanced payments.
Group policy is not to apply individual credit limits to trade and other receivables, although total exposure and payment performance are monitored monthly both at individual project and client level.
The Group has a wide range of customers and in the view of management excluding the Middle East as discussed elsewhere in the Financial Statements, there are no concentrations of credit risk that cause concern.

Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facility and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these and monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements.
On 1 August 2007, an unsecured revolving credit facility of 125.0m was put in place jointly with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB to finance the acquisition of HBS Business Services Group Limited and provide capacity for the future growth and development of the business.
On 4 March 2008, the Group extended this facility to 185.0m, following the decision to acquire Hedra plc.
With effect from 30 March 2009, the Groups credit facilities were amended and restated.
As a result, the Group now has facilities totalling 190.0m with Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Barclays.
Of the 190.0m, 125.0m is in the form of revolving credit facilities which reduces by 10.0m in March each year, commencing March 2010, with the remaining balances of 30.0m expiring on 1 August 2012, and 65.0m expiring on 31 October 2012.
The balance of 65.0m is in the form of a term loan which also falls due for repayment on 31 October 2012.
As at 31 July 2009, the Group was in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility.

Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
For capital management purposes, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the consolidated net borrowings to consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.

Sharesave scheme The Sharesave scheme is a savings plan whereby employees contract to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution over a three-year period.
At the end of the savings term, the employees are given the option to purchase shares at a price set before savings began.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise it lapses.
Participants leaving for a qualifying reason have six months within which to exercise their option up to their savings amount.
Options over 1,111,940 ordinary shares were granted under this scheme during the year, with 1,098,481 remaining at 31 July 2009.

These schemes are a combination of defined benefit, defined contribution and third-party defined benefit schemes.
a Schemes accounted for on a defined contribution basis The Legal and General GPP Scheme, Parkman Defined Contribution Scheme and the Parkman Ireland Pension Scheme DC section are defined contribution schemes.
Upon the acquisition of HBS Business Services Group Limited and Hedra plc the Group became responsible for their defined contribution schemes.
Some employees who transferred to the Group under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 as amended TUPE remain members of their previous schemes, which are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
Where under the terms of the contracts, the defined benefit liability effectively remains with the relevant council, the Group accounts for these schemes as defined contribution schemes.
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.
b Schemes accounted for on a defined benefit basis third-party schemes MBS have admitted body status in the Teesside pre-funded defined benefit scheme, as employees of MBS who were previously employed by the local council remain members of the Teesside Pension Fund.
The assets and liabilities of this scheme are identified under retirement benefit obligations on the balance sheet and disclosed as third-party schemes in section d overleaf.
c Schemes accounted for on a defined benefit basis Group schemes The Mouchel Business Services Limited Pension Scheme MBS, the Mouchel Superannuation Fund MSF and the Mouchel Staff Pension Scheme MSPS are funded defined benefit schemes and are disclosed as Group schemes in section d overleaf.
For the three principal defined benefit schemes that the Group is now responsible for, the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate, trustee-administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
In line with normal business practice these valuations are undertaken on a triennial basis.
All schemes are closed to new entrants except for employees transferring to the Group under TUPE, where the Group is required to provide benefits which are broadly comparable to those provided under the Local Government Pension Scheme or another defined benefit scheme provided by the transferring employer.
Given the membership of the schemes, under the projected unit credit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The most recent full actuarial valuations for all of the schemes took place in March 2007.
The key assumptions used in valuing the retirement benefit obligation at the end of the year were: 2009 2008 % % Discount rate 6.0 6.0 6.6 6.5 Expected rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.3 5.6 5.3 Expected rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2 3.3 3.6 3.8 Expected rate of price inflation 3.3 3.3 3.6 3.8 Note: Data for Group schemes is given first, followed by data for third-party schemes.
