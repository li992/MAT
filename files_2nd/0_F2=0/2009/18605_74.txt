Pension Costs Defined contribution scheme The group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Pension arrangements for directors are disclosed in the report of the remuneration committee and the directors' remuneration report on page 40.
The pension cost charge of 0.8m 2008: 0.9m in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group.
Defined benefit scheme In addition to the above, the group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager.
Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2007.
This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger plc in 2003.
No benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003 although active members retain a final salary link.
Pension benefits for deferred members are based on the members' final pensionable salaries and service at the date employment ceased or date of leaving if earlier.
The company has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenditure SORIE.
Pension Costs continued The actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2007 was based on the main actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.8% per annum, salary increases of 4.9% per annum and inflation-linked increases to pensions in deferment of 3.4% per annum.
The scheme assets were valued at 17.9m and scheme liabilities at 21.1m, a funding level of 85%.
The funding level for the scheme at the previous valuation as at 1 July 2004 was 79%.
The trustees and the employer have agreed a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit.
This plan will run for seven years with company contributions to the scheme of 48,350 per month, 580,200 per annum.
The actuary also undertook a Section 179 valuation as at 1 July 2007 as required by the Pension Protection Fund.
The funding level on a Section 179 valuation basis was 142%.
The scheme was closed to new members and to employee contributions in 2003.
Accordingly, there is no current service cost for the scheme.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the 1 July 2007 actuarial valuation but have been updated to 30 September 2009 by qualified independent actuary.
Principal actuarial assumptions under IAS 19 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.30% p. a.
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 5.00% p. a.
Rate of increase for deferred pensioners 3.05% p. a.
Expected return on assets 6.50% p. a.
The overall expected return on assets assumption of 5.30% pa as at 30 September 2009 has been derived by calculating the weighted average of the expected rate of return for each asset class.
The following approach has been used to determine the expected rate of return for each asset class: -fixed interest securities, current market yieldsequities, allowance for an additional return of 2.60% pa above that available on UK government securitiesproperty, allowance for an additional return of 2.60% pa above that available on UK government securitiescash, current Bank of England base rate Demographic assumptions 2009 2008 107% of PCMA00 year 107% of PCMA00 year of birth of birth tables allowing tables allowing for long for long cohort cohort improvements with improvements with 1.25% minimum Mortality tables for pensioners 1.25% minimum improvements for males and improvements for males 0.75% minimum and 0.75% minimum improvements for females improvements for each year females each year Mortality tables for non pensioners As for pensioners As for pensioners 30 September 2009 30 September 2008 Life expectancies Males Females Males Females Life expectancy for a current 65 year old 88.2 years 90.3 years 88.7 years 90.7 years Life expectancy at age 65 for a current 55 year old 89.5 years 91.1 years 89.5 years 91.1 years The other demographic assumptions are the same as those adopted in the Scheme Funding valuation as at 1 July 2007.

As the above table shows, the assets of the scheme are primarily held within equities and bonds.
The equity return of 6.5% in 2009 and 7.3% in 2008 is based on an equity risk premium of 2.6% above the 15-year fixed rate on gilts.
The directors consider this to be at the mid point of the acceptable range.
The return on bonds has been determined by reference to actual yields.
