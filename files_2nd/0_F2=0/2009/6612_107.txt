GSK normally pays a dividend two quarters after the quarter to which it relates and one quarter after it is declared.
The 2009 financial statements recognise those dividends paid in 2009, namely the third and fourth interim dividends for 2008 and the first and second interim dividends for 2009.
The amounts recognised in each year are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Dividends to shareholders 3,003 2,929 2,793 17 Property, plant and equipment Plant, Land and equipment Assets in buildings and vehicles construction Total m m m m Cost at 1st January 2008 4,634 8,497 1,956 15,087 Exchange adjustments 1,046 1,471 442 2,959 Additions 124 425 895 1,444 Additions through business combinations 13 7 20 Disposals and write-offs 128 356 27 511 Reclassifications 292 643 944 9 Transfer to assets held for sale 2 1 3 5,979 10,686 2,322 18,987 Cost at 31st December 2008 Exchange adjustments 343 493 154 990 Additions 188 432 803 1,423 Additions through business combinations 67 76 8 151 Capitalised borrowing costs 1 1 Disposals and write-offs 184 614 5 803 Reclassifications 309 430 735 4 Transfer to assets held for sale 14 2 16 Cost at 31st December 2009 6,002 10,515 2,240 18,757 GSK Annual Report 2009 Financial statements P91P182 Business review P06P53 Governance and remuneration P54P90 Financial statements P91P182 Shareholder information P183P204 119 Notes to the financial statements 17 Property, plant and equipment continued Plant, Land and equipment Assets in buildings and vehicles construction Total m m m m Depreciation at 1st January 2008 1,534 5,290 6,824 Exchange adjustments 385 914 1,299 Provision for the year 228 692 920 Disposals and write-offs 85 265 350 Transfer to assets held for sale 1 1 Depreciation at 31st December 2008 2,062 6,630 8,692 Exchange adjustments 128 312 440 Provision for the year 283 847 1,130 Disposals and write-offs 129 478 607 Transfer to assets held for sale 1 1 2 Depreciation at 31st December 2009 2,087 6,686 8,773 Impairment at 1st January 2008 122 239 81 442 Exchange adjustments 22 27 14 63 Disposals and write-offs 50 67 27 144 Impairment losses 70 176 20 266 Reclassifications 44 44 Reversal of impairments 3 7 10 Impairment at 31st December 2008 161 412 44 617 Exchange adjustments 6 10 4 20 Disposals and write-offs 28 104 4 136 Impairment losses 27 108 25 160 Reversal of impairments 1 10 11 Impairment at 31st December 2009 153 396 61 610 Total depreciation and impairment at 31st December 2008 2,223 7,042 44 9,309 Total depreciation and impairment at 31st December 2009 2,240 7,082 61 9,383 Net book value at 1st January 2008 2,978 2,968 1,875 7,821 Net book value at 31st December 2008 3,756 3,644 2,278 9,678 Net book value at 31st December 2009 3,762 3,433 2,179 9,374 The net book value at 31st December 2009 of the Groups land and buildings comprises freehold properties 3,462 million 2008 3,510 million, properties with leases of 50 years or more 239 million 2008 185 million and properties with leases of less than 50 years 61 million 2008 61 million.
Included in land and buildings at 31st December 2009 are leased assets with a cost of 561 million 2008 519 million, accumulated depreciation of 261 million 2008 263 million, impairment of nil 2008 8 million and a net book value of 300 million 2008 248 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31st December 2009 are leased assets with a cost of 126 million 2008 77 million, accumulated depreciation of 44 million 2008 36 million, and a net book value of 82 million 2008 41 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country specific risks.
Where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 11%.
The impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 95 million, R&D 47 million and SG&A 18 million, and include 57 million 2008 197 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
