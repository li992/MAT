Notes to the Accounts 1 General Information The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Accounting Standards Committee IASC, as adopted by the European Union.
The Groups presentational currency is pounds sterling.
Pounds sterling is also the functional currency because it is the currency which is most relevant to the majority of the Companys shareholders and creditors and the currency in which the majority of the Groups operating expenses are paid.
The principal accounting policies followed are set out below: 2.
Accounting Policies a Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the inclusion of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are set out in the Business Review section of the Directors Report on pages 21 to 24.
The financial position of the Group as at 30 April 2009 is shown in the balance sheet on page 40.
As at 30 April 2009 the Groups total assets less current liabilities exceeded its total non current liabilities by a multiple of over ten.
The assets of the Group consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on page 21 and these securities are readily realisable.
The Directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups accounts.
b Basis of Consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, PCT Finance Limited made up to 30 April each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Income Statement, is only presented in consolidated form, as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. c Presentation of Consolidated Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the guidance set out by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Income Statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue return column of the Consolidated Income Statement on an ex-dividend basis.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and may be considered to be either revenue or capital items.
The facts and circumstances are considered on a case by case basis before a conclusion on appropriate allocation is reached.
42 Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC Where the Company has received dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any excess in value of shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the capital return column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised under the effective interest rate method.
Bank interest and other income receivable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses and Finance costs All expenses, including the management fee, are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses have been presented as revenue items except as follows: any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are expensed and included in the costs of acquisition or deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate.
Finance costs are calculated using the effective interest rate method and are accounted for on an accruals basis.
f Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the overseas withholding tax deducted from investment income, tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Consolidated Income Statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 43 Notes to the Accounts continued g Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value.
On initial recognition the Group has designated all of its investments as held at fair value through profit or loss as defined by IFRS.
All investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the Companys accounts at fair value.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair value for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
Changes in fair value of all investments held at fair value and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the capital return column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
h Other receivables Other receivables do not carry any interest and are short-term in nature and are accordingly stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
j Other payables Other payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
k Non current liabilities All bank loans are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition these loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on settlement.
The amounts falling due for repayment within one year are included under current liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
l Rates of exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of each transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on that date.
Profits or losses on exchange, together with differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets or liabilities, are taken to the capital return column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on investments held at fair value are included within changes in fair value.
44 Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC m Capital reserves Capital reserve gains losses on disposal includes: gains losses on disposal of investments exchange differences on currency balances and on settlement of loan balances cost of own shares bought back other capital charges and credits charged to this account in accordance with the accounting policies above Capital reserve revaluation includes: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments and loans held at the year end.
All of the above are accounted for in the Income Statement except the cost of own shares bought back which is accounted for in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
n Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio, the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in capital values of the holdings.
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the market risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group.
The use of financial derivatives by the Group does not qualify for hedge accounting.
As a result changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented in the capital return column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
o Segmental Reporting Geographical segments are considered to be the primary reporting segments.
An analysis of investments held and investment income by geographical segment is set out in note 28.
Analysis of expenses by geographical segment and of profit by geographical segment have not been given as it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way.
Analyses of the remaining assets and liabilities by geographical region have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way, or the results are not considered to be significant.
Business segments are the secondary reporting segments.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business with the objective of maximising capital growth for its shareholders through investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies around the world.
p Key estimates and assumptions Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The only estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market.
These are valued in accordance with the techniques set out in note 1 g. At the year end, unquoted investments represent 0.3% of net assets.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 45 Notes to the Accounts continued q Accounting standards issued but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following applicable Standards were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 23 revised requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the costs of that asset.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
Following a review of IFRS 8, the company has reached the conclusion that the current segmentation reporting reflects the management approach, and as such, adoption of IFRS 8 will not have a significant impact on financial disclosures.
Amendments to IAS 1 prohibit the presentation of items of income and expense that is non-owner changes in equity in the statement of changes in equity, requiring non-owner changes in equity to be presented separately from owner changes in equity.
Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 allow first-time adopters to use a deemed cost to measure the initial cost of investments in the separate financial statements and removes the definition of the cost method from IAS 27 by replacing it with a new requirement.
Amendments to IAS 27 required the effects of all transactions with a non-controlling interest minority interest to be recognised in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 required an entity to classify puttable financial instruments and instruments, or components of instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation as equity.
Amendment to IAS 39 clarifies whether a hedged risk or portion of cash flows is eligible for hedge accounting.
The following interpretations are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009: IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 15 Agreements for constructions of real estates IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In 2004, the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JP Morgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should have been charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgement on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies.
The Company has had two investment managers since its formation in December 1996.
Henderson Global Investors managed the Companys portfolio from formation up to 9 February 2001 and Polar Capital has been the investment manager since that date.
From 31 July 2007 the Company has ceased to be charged VAT on management fees.
The Company has recovered 237,000 of previously charged VAT on management fees from Henderson Global Investors for the period from October 2000 to February 2001 and is due to recover 870,000 from Polar Capital for the period from February 2001 to July 2007.
The total recovery of 1,107,000 is shown separately in the Consolidated Income Statement as a reduction to the management fee expense.
The Company has recognised 182,000 of interest from HMRC in relation to the recovery of VAT of which 141,000 is outstanding at the Balance Sheet date.

In the Finance Act 2008, the Chancellor reduced the rate of Corporation Tax from 30% to 28% for the financial year commencing April 2008.
Due to the Companys tax status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval of such status in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The Group invests in equities and other financial instruments for the long term to further the investment objective set out on page 21.
This exposes the Group to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Group.
The main risks arising from the Groups pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the accounts relate.
The Groups exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and fixed interest securities which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Groups operations Derivative transactions which the Group enters into may include equity or index options, index futures contracts, and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks and foreign exchange risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 29 a i, currency risk see note 29 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 29 a iii.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 55 Notes to the Accounts continued i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Group faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 14 and 19.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies as stated in Note 2 g. The Group has no derivative instruments at the year-end, but, in the event that it had, the value of derivative instruments held at the balance sheet date would be determined by reference to their fair value at that date.
Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Market price risks exposure The Groups exposure to changes in market prices at 30 April on its quoted and unquoted equity investments was as follows: 30 April 2009 30 April 2008 000 000 Non-current asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 267,845 285,569 267,845 285,569 An analysis of the Groups portfolio is shown on pages 14 to 19.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2008:15% in the fair values of the Groups equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.
56 Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC Foreign currency exposure The table below shows, by currency, the split of the Groups non-sterling monetary assets, liabilities and investments that are priced in currencies other than sterling.

Contracts awaiting settlement at the year end are disclosed in notes 15 and 16 and are included in other receivables and other payables above.
During the financial year sterling depreciated by 25.2% against the US dollar 2008: depreciated by 1.0%, depreciated by 29.6% against the Japanese yen 2008: depreciated by 13.4% and depreciated by 12.1% against the Euro 2008: depreciated by 13.2%.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the loss after tax for the year and the value of shareholders funds in regard to the monetary and non-monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 10% 2008: 10% Euro - 10% 2008: 10% Japanese yen - 15% 2008: 15% ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 57 Notes to the Accounts continued If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2009 30 April 2008 000 000 US dollar Euro Yen US dollar Euro Yen Income statement loss after tax Revenue return 123 34 4 63 39 3 Capital return 22,900 1,674 1,910 22,633 3,566 123 Change to the loss after tax for the year 23,023 1,708 1,914 22,696 3,605 126 Change to shareholders funds 23,023 1,708 1,914 22,696 3,605 126 If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2009 30 April 2008 000 000 US dollar Euro Yen US dollar Euro Yen Income statement loss after tax Revenue return 101 27 3 52 32 2 Capital return 18,737 1,370 1,412 18,518 2,918 90 Change to the loss after tax for the year 18,838 1,397 1,415 18,570 2,950 92 Change to shareholders funds 18,838 1,397 1,415 18,570 2,950 92 In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may effect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Group finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Group uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
58 Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC Interest rate exposure The exposure, at 30 April, of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk when the rate is due to be re-set: fixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

The table below illustrates the Groups sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows: 30 April 2009 30 April 2008 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement loss after tax Revenue return 16 16 37 37 Capital return Change to the loss after tax for the year 16 16 37 37 Change to shareholders funds 16 16 37 37 This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 59 Notes to the Accounts continued b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the possibility of failure of the Group to realise sufficient assets to meet its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Groups assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which may be sold to meet funding requirements as necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in note 17 to the accounts.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
c Credit Risk All cash balances are held with AAA-rated counterparties.
Credit risk is the exposure to loss from failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.
Management of the risk This risk is not considered significant.
The Group manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers and by dealing through Polar Capital.
All cash balances are held with approved counterparties.
These arrangements were in place throughout the current year and the prior year.
Credit risk exposure None of the Groups financial assets are past due or impaired.
d Gearing risk The Companys policy is to increase its exposure to equity markets through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in note 17.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the financial statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.
e Capital Management Policies and Procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: The Companys capital, or equity, is represented by its net assets which are managed to achieve the Companys investment objective set out on page 21.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys fixed rate loan facility and ii the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.
In addition in order to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividend, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Company is also subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the loan covenants set out in the loan facility.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
