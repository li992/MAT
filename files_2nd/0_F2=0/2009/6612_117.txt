Provisions are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the final outcome and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of provision is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the provisions are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes: by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid defined benefit schemes also include defined contribution sections.
