Investments are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted future earnings from the investment.
Other investments are those classified as available-for sale.
Available-for-sale investments are initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at fair value.
Changes to the fair value of available-for sale investments are recognised in equity.
Taxation including deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the profit and loss when there is objective evidence that the financial asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is designated cash flow hedging instrument.
Derivative financial instruments embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Share-based payments During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Company has adopted a number of equity-settled share award schemes the details of which are provided in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Companys financial statements and is measured at fair value of the awards at the date of grant.
Fair value is determined using Black Scholes model, Monte Carlo model or a binomial model as deemed most appropriate.
The fair value determined at the date of grant of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions where appropriate.
In accordance with UITF 44 and FRS 20 Share-based Payment, where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
