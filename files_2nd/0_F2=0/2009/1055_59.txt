Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences i. e. differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences with certain limited exceptions.
The Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of profits from Chile and the other countries in which it operates and deferred tax is provided on undistributed earnings to the extent that remittance is probable in the foreseeable future.
The rate of first category i. e. corporation tax in Chile was 17% for both 2009 and 2008.
Los Pelambres, El Tesoro and Michilla are also subject to a mining tax royalty which imposes an additional tax of 4% of tax-adjusted operating profit.
Production from the Tesoro North East deposit is subject to the mining tax at a rate of 5% of tax-adjusted operating profit.
The mining tax is tax deductible i. e. an allowable expense in determining liability to first category tax.
In addition to first category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of profits from Chile.
Withholding tax is levied on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category tax already paid.
Accordingly, the effective tax rate of withholding tax for the purpose of paying dividends to Group shareholders is approximately 18% of the amount remitted or expected to be remitted.
