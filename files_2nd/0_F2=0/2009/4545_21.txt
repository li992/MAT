Key assumptions made in this respect are given in note 13.
The addition in the year ended 30 June 2008 arose from the acquisition of Dechra Veterinary Products Holdings A S formerly VetXX Holdings A S see note 27.
Intangible Assets continued Development costs are internally generated.
All other additions to intangible assets were acquired outside the Group and have been measured at cost or fair value at the time of acquisition.
The amortisation charge is recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
The principal asset within patent rights comprises payments to acquire the right to develop and market Trilostane, the active ingredient of Vetoryl Capsules, for animal health applications in the USA and Canada.
The carrying value at 30 June 2009 was 2.1 million with a remaining amortisation period of 9 years.
822,000 of the marketing authorisations relate to the Vetivex range of products.
The Vetivex marketing authorisations are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
Ownership of the marketing authorisations rests with the Group in perpetuity.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit their useful lives.
Vetivex is an established range of products which are relatively simple in nature and there are a limited number of players in the market.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the marketing authorisations are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
Acquired intangibles comprise: Marketing authorisations, brands and trademarks of products recognised on the acquisition of Dechra Veterinary Products Holdings A S formerly VetXX Holdings A S Customer relationships recognised on the acquisition of Leeds Veterinary Laboratories Limited Trademarks and brands recognised on the acquisition of Pharmaderm Animal Health The principal assets within acquired intangibles are the marketing authorisations, brands and trademarks of products recognised on the acquisition of Dechra Veterinary Products Holdings A S. The carrying value of these assets at 30 June 2009 was 56.6 million with a remaining amortisation period of 8 years.
The other significant assets within acquired intangibles are the trademarks and brands recognised on the acquisition of Pharmaderm Animal Health.
The carrying value at 30 June 2009 was 2.2 million with a remaining amortisation period of 13 years.

Impairment Reviews Goodwill, indefinite life assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that amounts might be impaired.
The impairment test involves determining the recoverable amounts of the relevant asset or cash-generating unit, which corresponds to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or its value in use.
Value in use calculations are performed by forecasting the future cash flows attributable to the asset being tested or the relevant cashgenerating unit in respect of goodwill.
The forecast cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate as described below.
Projected future cash flows have been derived from the annual budget for the year ending 30 June 2010 extrapolated by applying a growth rate of 5% 2008: 5% per annum up to year five and thereafter a growth rate of 1% 2008: nil% per annum into perpetuity which is considered to be consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
The budget has been formulated based on various factors, including market growth forecasts, the experience of the impact of previous recessions and existing product growth.
These factors reflect past experience of the Group and where applicable are consistent with external sources of information.
The pre-tax discount rates have been estimated using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which is adjusted for consideration of market information, and risk adjusted dependent upon the specific circumstances of each asset or cash-generating unit.
Value in use calculations were performed at 30 June 2009 for the following assets: a Goodwill 2009 2008 Carrying Pre-tax Carrying Pre-tax value discount rate value discount rate Cash-generating unit 000 % 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 16,253 11.73 14,992 9.93 Laboratories 2,621 10.42 2,621 9.93 Dales 2,231 10.42 2,231 9.93 b Indefinite Life Assets 2009 2008 Carrying Pre-tax Carrying Pre-tax value discount rate value discount rate Asset 000 % 000 % Vetivex licences 822 11.73 822 9.93 In all cases there was significant headroom between the carrying value and the value in use and no impairment provision is therefore required.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 1% would still not result in the requirement for an impairment provision.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures The Groups financial instruments comprise cash deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, derivatives used for hedging purposes and trade receivables and payables.
Treasury Policy The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits.
The role of the Groups treasury activities is to manage and monitor the Groups external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of the Groups corporate activities.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance its operations and to manage market risks from these operations.
Derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate floors and ceilings, are used to hedge against changes in foreign currencies and interest rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and the Groups treasury policies specifically prohibit such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital Management The capital structure of the Group consists of net borrowings and Shareholders equity.
At 30 June 2009, net borrowings were 15.5 million, whilst shareholders equity was 80.7 million.
The Group manages its capital structure to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity that allows sufficient headroom to finance the Groups product development programme and appropriate acquisitions.
Current economic conditions mean that it is more difficult and expensive to obtain finance via borrowings.
It is therefore the policy of the Board to reduce borrowings over time.
The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades.
The Groups operating subsidiaries are generally cash generative and none are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the development of new products as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain borrowing facilities centrally which are then used to finance the Groups operating subsidiaries, either by way of equity investments or loans.
Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk market risk credit risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities as they fall due.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced quarterly.
These are reviewed to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
The Group manages its funding requirements through the following lines of credit: 27.5 million term loan 15 million revolving credit facility 10 million working capital facility various finance leases The Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 June 2009 are detailed in note 20.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates linked to base rate or LIBOR and are consequently exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has hedged interest rate risk on its term loan by means of an interest rate floor and ceiling arrangement whereby the Groups exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR is limited to a minimum rate of 4.40% and a maximum rate of 5.70%.
The amount of the term loan outstanding at 30 June 2009 was 27.5 million.
The hedge is in place until 31 December 2010 and the amount hedged matches the repayment profile of the loan.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows is not hedged.
The Group matches receipts and payments in the relevant foreign currencies as far as possible.
To this end, bank accounts are maintained for all the major currencies in which the Group trades.
Where foreign subsidiaries have ongoing funding requirements in the local currency, then forward contracts are used.
The Group also hedges selectively expected currency cash flows outside normal trading activities, principally using foreign currency options.
The Group hedges its net investment in major overseas subsidiaries by denominating an appropriate amount of borrowings in the local currency to match the net assets of the subsidiary.
However, translational exposure in converting the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups presentational currency of sterling is not hedged.
Borrowings that are denominated in foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets are treated as hedges against the relevant assets.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 71,972,000 2008: 67,380,000 which is the total carrying value of the Groups financial assets.
Cash is only deposited with highly rated banks.
The Group offers trade credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Trade and bank references are obtained prior to extending credit.
The financial statements of corporate customers are monitored on a regular basis.
The principal customers of the Services Division are UK veterinary practices.
The customer base is diverse and, with the exception of the largest corporate accounts, the failure of a single customer would not have a material adverse impact on the Groups financial results.
The principal customers of the Pharmaceuticals Division are European and US wholesalers.
The failure of a large wholesaler could have a material adverse impact on the Groups financial results.
The largest customer of the Group accounted for approximately 8.0% of gross trade receivables at 30 June 2009 2008: 7.5%.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008.
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: l Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount.
l Forward exchange contracts based on market price and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
l Curr ency options and interest rate floor and ceiling based upon the amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, being the market price of the instrument.
l Receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount.

Share-based Payments During the year, the Company operated the Unapproved Share Option Scheme, the Approved Share Option Scheme, the Long Term Incentive Plan, the Executive Incentive Plan and the Save As You Earn SAYE Share Option Scheme as described below: Unapproved and Approved Share Option Schemes Under these Schemes, options are granted to certain Executives and employees of the Group excluding Executive Directors to purchase shares in the Company at a price fixed at the average market value over the three days prior to the date of grant.
For the options to vest, there must be an increase in earnings per share of at least 12% above the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over a three year period.
Once vested, options must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
Executive Incentive Plan Under this plan Executive Directors and selected Senior Executives have previously been awarded shares in the Company subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance target.
No awards have been made under this plan since 30 June 2008.
The TSR target measures the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE Small Cap Index over a three year measurement period commencing at the beginning of the financial year in which the awards are made.
One hundred per cent of the shares on plans set up prior to 30 June 2008 will vest if the Company achieves an upper quartile performance, 30% of the shares vest at median performance and awards vest on a straight-line basis for performance in between.
No shares vest if performance is below median.
In addition, awards will only vest if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the performance of the Company has been satisfactory.
Long Term Incentive Plan For awards granted after 30 June 2008 under this plan, vesting is dependent firstly on an earnings per share target.
No awards will vest unless adjusted diluted earnings per share has grown by at least 3% per annum above the retail prices index over the three year measurement period.
Provided this condition is met, then the number of shares that vest depends on the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE Small Cap Index over the three year measurement period.
One hundred per cent of the shares vest if the Company achieves an upper quartile performance, 25% of the shares vest at median performance and awards vest on a straight-line basis for performance in between.
SAYE Option Scheme This Scheme is open to all UK employees.
Participants save a fixed amount of up to 250 per month for either three, five or seven years and are then able to use these savings to buy shares in the Company at a price fixed at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
The SAYE options must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period.
The exercise of these options is not subject to any performance criteria.
For options exercised during the year, the weighted average market price at the date of exercise was 400p 2008: 409p.
The weighted average remaining contractual lives of options outstanding at the balance sheet date was four years 2008: four years.
Outstanding options on all Executive Incentive, Approved and Unapproved plans prior to 30 June 2006 were exercisable at 30 June 2009.
No options issued under SAYE plans were exercisable at 30 June 2009.
Share-based Payments continued As allowed by the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, included above are options over shares that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted before 7 November 2002.
The fair values for shares granted under the Unapproved, Approved and SAYE Option Schemes have been calculated using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
The fair values of shares awarded under the Executive Incentive Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan have been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market-based performance conditions attaching to those shares.

Share-based Payments continued National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payments.
These contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments and are therefore treated as cash-settled awards.
The total charge to the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments was: 2009 2008 000 000 Equity-settled share-based transactions 643 603 Cash-settled share-based transactions 98 156 741 759 The above charge to the Income Statement is included within administrative expenses.

Acquisition of Subsidiary There have been no acquisitions in the year ended 30 June 2009.
On 15 January 2008 the Company acquired the entire share capital of Dechra Veterinary Products Holdings A S formerly VetXX Holdings A S, a Danish company.
The assets and liabilities acquired are allocated as follows: Book Fair value Fair value adjustments value 000 000 000 Intangible assets see note 11 261 59,254 59,515 Property, plant and equipment see note 12 2,946 88 2,858 Deferred tax assets 1,094 1,094 Inventories 2,699 2,699 Trade and other receivables 7,268 7,268 Trade and other payables 7,295 711 8,006 Current tax 11 11 Deferred tax liabilities 14,663 14,663 Net assets 6,962 43,792 50,754 Goodwill see note 11 14,397 Consideration including costs 65,151 Satisfied by: Cash 63,658 Expenses of acquisition 1,493 Cash flow on acquisition 65,151 Goodwill represents the present value of synergies expected to arise following the acquisition.
The fair value adjustment in relation to intangible assets recognises marketing authorisations, brands and trademarks in accordance with IFRS 3.
The deferred tax adjustment reflects the tax effect of the fair value adjustments.
Other adjustments reflect the estimated realisable value of the assets and liabilities.
For the 12 month period ended 30 June 2008 Dechra Veterinary Products Holdings A S made a consolidated operating profit of 5,818,000, of which 2,651,000 was recognised in the period following acquisition.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 July 2007, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been 323.2 million and adjusted operating profit for the period would have been 22.31 million.

Contingency The Danish tax authorities have opened an investigation into the tax return of Dechra Veterinary Products Holdings A S formerly VetXX Holdings A S for the period ended 31 December 2005, a period prior to the acquisition of the company.
They are seeking to reduce the tax losses arising in this year by DKK17.5 million.
The Directors believe that there are strong arguments to resist this claim.
However, should the dispute be lost, the deferred tax asset recognised on acquisition would be reduced by approximately 500,000.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty Critical Judgements in applying the Groups Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainity In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies as described in note 1, the Directors have made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are also discussed below: Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life assets are impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which they are allocated.
Estimating the value-in-use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Further detail on the assumptions used in determining value-in-use calculations is provided in note 13.
Impairment of Receivables The Group has estimated impairment of receivables by assessing recoverability of amounts due on a customer by customer basis.
As described in note 21, credit risk is not highly concentrated with the exception of corporate veterinary practices and veterinary wholesalers.
If the receivables due from one of these large customers proved to be irrecoverable then an additional impairment provision may be required.
Capitalisation of Development Costs The Group applies judgement when assessing the probability that regulatory approval will be achieved for development projects and that those projects are commercially viable.
This enables management to ascertain whether the criteria for the capitalisation of development costs have been met.
