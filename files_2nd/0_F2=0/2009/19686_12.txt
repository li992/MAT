co. uk accounting Policies fOr THe yeAr enDeD 30TH nOvember 2009 basis of preparation The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the group for the year ended 30th November 2009, applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties, derivative financial instruments and the defined benefit section of the groups pension scheme.
The groups functional currency is pounds sterling and its IFRS accounting policies are set out below.
basis of consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of St. Modwen Properties PLC and the entities it controls.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights or by contractual agreement.
A list of the principal entities controlled is given in note F of the companys financial statements.
VSM Estates Holdings Limited is 50% owned by St. Modwen Properties PLC: however, under the funding agreement the group obtains the majority of the benefits of the entity and also retains the majority of the residual risks.
This entity is therefore consolidated in accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
All entities are consolidated from the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets that are not held by the group and are presented separately within equity in the group balance sheet.
interests in joint ventures The group recognises its interest in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the interest in the joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the groups share of its net assets, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
The income statement reflects the groups share of the jointly controlled entities results after interest and tax.
Financial statements of jointly controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the group.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the group.
The group statement of recognised income and expense reflects the groups share of any income and expense recognised by the jointly controlled entities outside the income statement.
interests in associates The groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as described above.
Properties Investment properties Investment properties, being freehold and leasehold properties held to earn rental income, for capital appreciation and or for undetermined future use, are carried at fair value following initial recognition at the present value of the consideration payable.
To establish fair value, investment properties are independently valued on the basis of market value.
Any surplus or deficit arising is recognised in the income statement for the period.
Once classified as an investment property, a property remains in this category until development with a view to sale commences, at which point the asset is transferred to inventories at current valuation.
Where an investment property is being redeveloped for continued use as an investment property, the property remains within investment property and any movement in valuation is recognised in the income statement.

Profits and losses arising are recognised through the income statement and the profit on disposal is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset.
Investment properties are not depreciated.
Inventories Inventories principally comprise properties held for sale, properties under construction and land under option.
Cost comprises land, direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
When inventory includes a transfer from investment properties, cost is recorded as the book value at the date of transfer.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Finance costs Interest incurred is not capitalised, but charged to the income statement on an accruals basis.
Operating property, plant and equipment Operating property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all operating property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Leasehold operating properties over the shorter of the lease term and 25 years Plant, machinery and equipment over 2 to 5 years Leases The group as lessee Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Non-property assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability being recognised for the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Non-property assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Freehold interests in leasehold investment properties are accounted for as finance leases with the present value of guaranteed minimum ground rents included within the carrying value of the property and within long-term liabilities.
On payment of a guaranteed ground rent, virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The group as lessor Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
co. uk income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
The taxable result differs from the result as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, using the rates of tax expected to apply based on legislation enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Pensions The group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1st September 2009, to future accrual.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit section is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement immediately if the benefits have vested.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement as other finance income or expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the year in which they occur.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
When a pension asset net surplus arises and the directors consider it is controlled by the company such that future economic benefits will be available to the company, it is carried forward in accordance with the requirements of IFRIC 14.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they become payable.

dividends Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of property Revenue arising from the sale of property is recognised on legal completion of the sale.
Where revenue is earned for development of property assets not owned, this is recognised when the group has substantially fulfilled its obligations in respect of the transaction.
Construction contracts Revenue arising from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the groups accounting policy on construction contracts see below.
Rental income Rental income arising from investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income Dividend income from joint ventures is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Construction contracts Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
The extent to which the contract is complete is determined by the total costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total anticipated costs for the entire contract.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included only to the extent they have been agreed with the purchaser.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Government grants Government grants relating to property are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the assets concerned.
Share-based payments When employee share options are exercised the employee has the choice whether to have the liability settled by way of cash or the retention of shares.
As it has been the companys experience to satisfy the majority of share options in cash, and new shares are not issued to satisfy employee share option plans, the group accounts for its share option schemes as cash-settled.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value using an appropriate option pricing model and amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date.
Revisions to the fair value of the accrued liability after the end of the vesting period are recorded in the income statement of the year in which they occur.
co. uk Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for any amounts it may have to pay.
If the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
The group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the groups obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when there is evidence that the group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and short-term deposits with banks.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables on deferred payment terms are initially recorded by discounting the nominal amount payable to net present value.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the deferred arrangement and charged to finance costs.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance income or finance expense as appropriate.
Interest incurred is not capitalised, but charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The group has determined that the derivative financial instruments in use do not qualify for hedge accounting and, consequently, any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to the income statement.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received less direct issue costs.
Use of estimates and judgements To be able to prepare accounts according to generally accepted accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial accounts.
These estimates are based on the groups systems of internal control, historical experience and the advice of external experts including qualified professional valuers and actuaries together with various other assumptions that management and the board of directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.

This is discussed in the Business Review, under the heading Financing, covenants and going concern.
Valuation of investment properties Management has used the valuation performed by its independent valuers as the fair value of its investment properties.
The valuation is performed according to RICS rules, using appropriate levels of professional judgement for the prevailing market conditions.
Net realisable value of inventories The group has ongoing procedures for assessing the carrying value of inventories and identifying where this is in excess of net realisable value.
Managements assessment of any resulting provision requirement, is where applicable, supported by independent information supplied by the external valuers.
The estimates and judgements used were based on information available at, and pertaining to, 30th November 2009.
Any subsequent adverse changes in market conditions may result in additional provisions being required.
Estimation of remediation and other costs to complete for both development and investment properties.
In making an assessment of these costs there is inherent uncertainty and the group has developed systems of internal control to assess and review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Any changes to these estimates may impact the carrying values of investment properties and or inventories.
The calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities together with assessment of the recoverability of future tax losses.
The recoverability of tax losses has been assessed and the accounts reflect the extent to which management believe recovery is likely against latent gains and future profits anticipated to be realised on the groups property portfolio.
Calculation of the net present value of pension scheme liabilities In calculating this liability it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made, including discount and mortality rates and the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets.
The group engages a qualified actuary to assist with determining the assumptions to be made and evaluating these liabilities.

In both cases a deferred tax asset has been recognised on the basis that the losses or deductions will shelter the latent gains anticipated to be realised on the groups property portfolio including those reflected in the deferred tax liability for property revaluations.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 7.6m 2008: nil of current and prior year tax losses as it is not considered certain that there will be sufficient taxable profits available in the short term against which these can be offset.

The groups capital, market, credit and liquidity risks are discussed below.
Capital risk The group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the company consist of debt as disclosed in note 13, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 17 and 18.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in group income or group net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
Interest rate risk is the groups principal market risk and is considered below.
Interest rate risk management: The group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at variable interest rates.
The group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.

The credit risk on the groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high generally AA credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 2.2m 2008: 2.0m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 1.0m 2008: 0.7m which is fully provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.
This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

The following table provides an ageing analysis of these balances.
co. uk 16. financial instRuments cOnTinueD Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and through the use of bilateral facilities, overdrafts and cash with a range of maturity dates to ensure continuity of funding.
The equity issue in the year has reduced the groups liquidity risk compared to the prior year.
The economic climate, although slightly improved, continues to provide a difficult backdrop to the groups operations.
As such, the focus continues to be on reducing forward commitments by scaling back speculative development schemes, whilst continuing to marshal sites for development on the back of pre-let or pre-sold opportunities.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows for bank loans and overdrafts is shown in note 13.

Pensions cOnTinueD The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5th April 2008, when the market value of the assets of the scheme was 32.9m, a funding level of 104%.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS 19.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 6.3 %pa post-retirement 4.8 %pa Increase in earnings 6.6 %pa Increase in pensions 3.6 %pa Capped to 5.6% for certain members The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30th November 2009 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2009 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 5.5% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.6% 2.8% 3.5% Rate of increase in pensions in payment Pre 6th April 1997 benefits 3.0% 2.8% 3.0% Post 5th April 1997 benefits 3.6% 2.8% 3.5% Discount rate 5.5% 6.2% 5.8% Inflation assumption 3.6% 2.8% 3.5% Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31st August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with the retail prices index, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
The mortality rates adopted are from the PA92 year of birth and medium cohort tables which assume that, for example, male members who are currently retired are expected to draw their pensions for 26.8 years and non retired members for 27.7 years, based on the normal retirement age of 65.
The group expects to make contributions of 0.1m to the defined benefit section of the scheme for 2010 and in future years.
The fair values of assets in the defined benefit section of the scheme and the expected rates of return, based on market expectations, were: 2009 2008 2007 % m % m % m Equities 5.6 17.0 5.9 13.3 6.1 19.4 Bonds 5.4 1.4 7.2 0.5 5.8 0.4 Property 5.6 8.4 5.9 9.9 6.1 11.7 Cash and other assets 4.1 0.3 4.4 1.2 4.6 3.5 27.1 24.9 35.0 Actuarial value of liabilities 26.9 23.6 29.0 Unrecognised surplus 0.2 1.3 6.0 Surplus in the scheme being fair value of pension asset net of deferred tax The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses before unrecognised surplus of 0.2m recorded in the group statement of recognised income and expense is a loss of 2.0m 2008: 0.1m.

Compliance with SSAP19 Accounting for Investment Properties requires departure from the Companies Act 2006 relating to depreciation and an explanation of the departure is given below.
Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain properties, derivative financial instruments and the defined benefit section of the companys pension scheme.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that the company obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts and VAT.
interest receivable Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all plant, machinery and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Plant and equipment over 2 to 5 years Depreciation is not provided on investment properties which are subject to annual revaluations.
investment properties In accordance with SSAP 19, investment properties are revalued annually and the aggregate surplus or temporary deficit is transferred to the revaluation reserve.
Permanent diminutions are recognised through the profit and loss account.
No depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
The Companies Act 2006 requires all properties to be depreciated.
However, this requirement conflicts with the generally accepted accounting principle set out in SSAP 19.
The directors consider that, because these properties are not held for consumption but for their investment potential, to depreciate them would not give a true and fair view and that it is necessary to adopt SSAP19 in order to give a true and fair view.
If this departure from the Act had not been made, the profit for the financial year would have been reduced by depreciation.
However, the amount of depreciation cannot reasonably be quantified because depreciation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
investment in subsidiary and joint venture companies The investments in subsidiary and joint venture companies are included in the companys balance sheet at the companys share of net asset value.
The valuation recognises the cost of acquisition and changes in the book values of the underlying net assets.
The surplus or deficit arising on revaluation is reflected in the companys reserves.
deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions : provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
co. uk deferred taxation continued Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
interest Interest paid is charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt are allocated over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Share-based payment When employee share options are exercised the employee has the choice whether to have the liability settled by way of cash or the retention of shares.
As it has been the companys experience to satisfy the majority of share options in cash, and new shares are not issued to satisfy employee share option plans, the group accounts for its share option schemes as cash settled.
Revisions to the fair value of the accrued liability after the end of the vesting period are recorded in the profit and loss account of the year in which they occur.
Pensions The company operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and from 1st September 2009, to future accrual.
Past service costs are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately if the benefits have vested.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the profit and loss account as other finance income or expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the year in which they occur.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they become payable.
derivative financial instruments and hedging The company uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
The company has determined that the derivative financial instruments in use do not qualify for hedge accounting and, consequently, any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to the profit and loss account.
Full details of the companys derivative financial instruments are given in note 16 to the group financial statements.
Own shares St. Modwen Properties PLC shares held by the company are classified in shareholders equity and are recognised at cost.
interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and expense.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Cash flow statement The company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by FRS1 not to present a cash flow statement.
