Borrowings In February 2010, the Company renegotiated its loan facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, The Bank of Scotland plc and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG.
Under the terms of the renegotiations, the term of the loan facility was extended from March 2011 until January 2013 and the size of the facility was reduced from 550 million to 325 million, with further step-downs to 320 million in March 2011, 315 million in September 2011 and 250 million in March 2012.
The facility is subject to financial covenants see note 20.
The Company made drawdowns totalling 110 million from the facility during the year ended 31 December 2009.
The borrowings under the facility enabled the Company to maintain a significant cash balance in US dollar money market funds $200 million at year-end, acting as a partial currency hedge against the US dollar-denominated Senior Notes $252.9 million at year-end.
