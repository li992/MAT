Costs in respect of defined benefit schemes relate to payments due to the Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme in respect of four current and former employees, including the Companys executive Director, seconded from Schroder Investment Management Limited to SVG Advisers Limited SVGA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
SVGA and the Schemes trustees, taking advice from the independent actuaries, agree the contributions.
In accordance with IAS 19, the Groups contributions to the Scheme are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme on the basis that the Group is unable to readily identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme at the balance sheet date as there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to the Group.
Further details of the Scheme can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts of Schroders plc.
In particular, the Scheme had 299 active members in the defined benefit section at 31 December 2008 and the accounts of Schroders plc disclosed a net pension surplus in respect of the Scheme of 22.4 million, calculated under IAS 19.
However, Schroders interim results disclose net actuarial losses in the 6 months to 30 June 2009 amounting to 74.2 million.
The Group is currently in discussions with Schroders in respect of SVGs share of the Scheme deficit.

During the year ended 31 December 2009, gains on investments amounted to 51.3 million 2008: loss of 814.0 million for the Group and 50.8 million 2008: loss of 813.8 million for the Company.
As detailed in notes 28 and 29, the Company has agreed that it should focus its investments mainly on Permira Funds.
As such, and given that our largest exposures currently are to Permira Funds see notes 3 and 30, we expect that the performance of the Company will be largely dependent on the performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest.
