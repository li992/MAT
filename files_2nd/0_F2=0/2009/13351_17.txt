56 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 11 Intangible assets Brunning Blubeckers and Price Total Limited Limited Goodwill 000 000 000 Cost At 31 December 2007 11,275 15,241 26,516 1 Adjustment from change in estimates on acquisition of Brunning and Price Limited 275 275 At 28 and 29 December 2008 and at 27 December 2009 11,275 14,966 26,241 1 Following the acquisition of Brunning and Price Limited on 17 October 2007, adjustments were made as a result of changes in estimates after the provisional accounting was completed.
These adjustments were made in the year ended 28 December 2008 in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and resulted in a decrease of 0.3m in the goodwill on acquisition.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to a bi-annual impairment review, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use to the carrying value.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.96% 2008: 9.03%.
Since 1 January 1989 the cumulative amount of goodwill written off against realised reserves is 50.4m 2008: 50.4m.
Records for periods prior to this date are not readily available.
There was no impact on total net book value or the income statement.

Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited has an accounting year end date of 31 March and as there is no material benefit in making the accounting year end co-terminus with the Group, no change has been made.
As a result of a detailed review of the trading performance of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, the investment has been recorded at nil and a loan note of 10.4m, plus interest receivable, due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, was fully provided against as at 27 December 2009 and 28 December 2008.
The Groups share of the post-tax result of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited for the year ended 27 December 2009 was a loss of 0.04m 2008: loss of 0.61m.
This loss has not been recognised in the income statement, in accordance with IAS 28 Associates and Joint Ventures, as the investment has a carrying value of nil.
Interest is receivable from LV Finance Limited on the loan note of 10.4m at a rate of LIBOR.
In the year ended 27 December 2009 0.2m of interest has accrued of which the Group has recognised nil 2008: 0.6m of which the Group recognised nil.
Consequently in addition to the loan note of 10.4m outstanding at that date, 1.1m of interest receivable had accrued, of which, under the terms of the agreement, 1.0m was overdue.

Executive Share Option Plans ESOPs The Group has in place three ESOPs: the 1998 scheme, the 2003 scheme and a one-off scheme.
Under these schemes, the Remuneration Committee may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to employees of the Group.
Awards under the ESOPs are generally reserved for senior management level and above.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted under ESOPs become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to growth in earnings per share exceeding RPI growth by more than 4% under the 1998 scheme or 2.5% under the 2003 scheme.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
Options were valued using a Stochastic option pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Note: The one-off scheme is in respect of Alan Jacksons share options granted on 5 June 2001.
Further details are provided in the Directors remuneration report on page 35.
During the year Alan Jackson exercised no options under this scheme, and as at 27 December 2009 there are 200,000 share options outstanding.

62 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements Long-Term Incentive Plan On 9 November 2005 an Extraordinary General Meeting of The Restaurant Group plc approved the adoption of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the Group, details of which are provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 29 to 36.
Awards under the LTIP are generally reserved for senior management level and above.
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options are granted to Directors and selected employees.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares by a specified date, known as Deposited shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for these Matching Award share options to be valid.
The table below summarises the dates of awards under the LTIP and the dates by which Directors and employees were required to acquire their deposited shares.
Date of Award Date by which Deposited Shares must be acquired 7 December 2005 7 May 2006 8 March 2007 30 June 2007 6 March 2008 30 June 2008 5 March 2009 30 June 2009 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.

The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 67 Notes to the accounts continued 24 Financial instruments and derivatives continued b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but management believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 10.4m due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Groups associate company Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited.
This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures Restaurants Limited, formerly Est Est Est Restaurants Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limiteds bank.
In 2007, following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 13.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facilities by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facilities, which mature in 2012 as set out in note a above ensure continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors on page 28. d Foreign currency risk As the Group operates primarily within the United Kingdom any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is limited.
The Group operates three restaurants in Spain that are serviced by local Euro denominated debt.
The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements is controlled through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile and to ensure that a minimum level of borrowings are at fixed rates for the next two years in line with the Groups treasury strategy.
Details of the current swaps are set out in note a above.
The interest rate profile is reviewed on a regular basis.

There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.0m 2008: 2.9m.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2009 2009 2008 2008 Lease expiring: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 582 85 498 146 Within two to five years 26,008 3,045 13,964 3,004 After five years 533,262 41,448 544,190 43,221 559,852 44,578 558,652 46,371 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating leases, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concession division, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
26 Capital commitments 2009 2008 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 9,043 12,379 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 69 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
28 Related party transactions Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 38% holding.
A loan note of 10.4m is due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, which attracts interest at the rate of LIBOR.
During the year ended 27 December 2009, 0.2m of interest was accrued of which the Group recognised nil 2008: 0.6m of which the Group recognised nil.
