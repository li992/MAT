Share incentive plans The Company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP.
The SIP is open to all Group employees including Executive Directors who have completed at least six months service with a Group company at the date they are invited to participate in the plan.
The SIP permits the Company to make four different types of awards to employees free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and dividend shares, although the Company has, so far, made awards of partnership shares only.
Under these awards, the Company invites qualifying employees to apply between 10 and 125 per month in acquiring shares in the Company at the prevailing market price.
Under the terms of the scheme, certain tax advantages are available to the Company and employees.
Long term incentive plans The Executive Directors participate in The Go-Ahead Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 the LTIP.
The LTIP provides for Executive Directors and certain other senior employees to be awarded shares in the Company conditional on specified performance conditions being met over a period of three years.
Refer to the Directors Remuneration Report for further details of the LTIP.

Most of the items were non-cash, with cash items totalling 10.1m The largest item was a first half, non-cash impairment charge of 38.4m reflecting the challenging conditions in aviation service division.
This reduced the carrying value of the ground handling and cargo operations within the aviation services division to approximately 20.0m at December 2008 and remains appropriate at the year end.
Non-cash exceptional items also included 6.9m relating to the fair value of part of the current year bus fuel hedge designated as ineffective under IAS 39, 0.8m in respect of accelerated depreciation on articulated buses in London with a further exceptional charge of around 3.0m expected over the next two years, and 1.5m of provision for onerous contracts in our Meteor parking operations.
Exceptional cash costs totalled 10.1m, consisting of restructuring and reorganisation costs of 5.4m in the aviation services division and 4.7m in the rail division.
These costs have been included due to their relative size and managements anticipation of their non-recurring nature.

The brought forward element of the franchise intangible is made up of 25.2m relating to the opening deficit in the RPS and 12.0m relating to the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise assets relating to the Southeastern rail franchise.
The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchises being between six and eight years.
Software costs Software costs capitalised exclude software that is integral to the related hardware.
Customer contracts This relates to the value attributed to customer contracts and relationships purchased as part of the Groups acquisitions.
The value is calculated based on the unexpired term of the contracts at the date of acquisition and is amortised over that period.
Impairment During the year ended 27 June 2009 an impairment review of the aviation services division resulted in the goodwill of aviance and Plane Handling of 16.1m being written down to nil.
Software costs of 0.1m and customer contracts of 0.1m associated with the aviation services division were also impaired.
84 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Goodwill As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is annually tested for impairment.
The goodwill charge of 2.4m 2008: 2.4m is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to be impaired annually.
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: 2009 2008 m m aviance and Plane Handling 16.1 Meteor Parking 18.4 18.4 New Southern Railway 1.0 3.4 Metrobus 6.5 6.5 Go South Coast 28.6 28.6 Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1 Go West Midlands London Bus 10.5 10.5 Go North East 0.8 0.8 67.9 86.4 The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts, using a growth rate of 3.0% which reflects the Directors view of long term growth rates in each business.
The pre-tax cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% 2008: 12.1%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0.0-2.0% 2008: 0.0-2.0%.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period.
The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff costs and general overheads.
These assumptions are influenced by several internal and external factors.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
We have conducted sensitivity analyses on our calculations and have confirmed that, apart from aviance and Plane Handling where we have recorded an impairment of our assets this year, there is no reasonably possible movement on assumptions which would lead to impairment.
14. Business combinations Year ended 27 June 2009 There have been no business combinations during the year ended 27 June 2009.
Year ended 28 June 2008 On 10 September 2007, Go North East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the commercial bus operations and associated assets of Northumbria Coaches, a small independent Northumberland bus operator.
On 15 October 2007, Go North East Limited acquired the commercial bus operations and associated assets of Stanley Taxis, a small independent Durham bus operator.
On 28 January 2008 Go North East Limited acquired the commercial bus operations and associated assets of Redby Buses, a small independent Sunderland bus operator.
On 8 December 2007 Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired FirstGroups regulated bus operations in Orpington.
The total cash consideration for the above acquisitions was 5.5m.
They have been accounted for as acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3.
The acquisition balance sheets have been adjusted to reflect provisional fair values and the goodwill arising has been capitalised as an intangible asset.
Intangible assets acquired represent customer contracts of 1.2m.
Management believes that the goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value to the Group in respect of noncontractual relationships, customer loyalty, and an assembled workforce, for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
A property valuation has been completed.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Groups activities, namely working capital, fixed asset expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and fuel price risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2009 and 2008, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only purchased for internal benefit.
The main financial risks arising from the Groups activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Risks arising from fuel derivatives are explained in note 23.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates.
The Boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to 36 months.
During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging.
Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.
The maturity and interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 27 June 2009 is as follows: Average Within More than rate 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Year ended 27 June 2009 Floating rate liabilities assets Bank overdrafts 1.50 5.0 5.0 Variable rate loans 1.11 5.6 5.6 239.0 250.2 Obligations under finance lease and HP contracts 1.42 0.8 0.8 1.6 Interest rate swaps 2.20 49.5 50.0 99.5 Gross floating rate liabilities assets 11.4 6.4 49.5 189.0 157.3 Cash assets 0.78 207.1 207.1 Net floating rate assets liabilities 195.7 6.4 49.5 189.0 49.8 Fixed rate liabilities Medium term fixed rate loan 5.76 11.8 5.8 7.2 24.8 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 5.55 8.4 5.0 2.5 0.4 0.2 16.5 Interest rate swaps 2.20 49.5 50.0 99.5 20.2 10.8 59.2 50.4 0.2 140.8 Total floating and fixed profile 175.5 17.2 9.7 239.4 0.2 91.0 90 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Average Within 1 More than rate year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Year ended 28 June 2008 Floating rate liabilities assets Cash assets 5.59 157.1 157.1 Bank overdrafts 6.00 5.8 5.8 Variable rate loans 5.29 10.6 11.1 5.6 262.0 289.3 140.7 11.1 5.6 262.0 138.0 Fixed rate liabilities Medium term fixed rate loan 5.71 6.8 5.8 5.7 7.2 25.5 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 5.64 16.0 9.2 6.8 1.7 0.4 0.2 34.3 22.8 15.0 12.5 8.9 0.4 0.2 59.8 Total floating and fixed profile 117.9 26.1 18.1 8.9 262.4 0.2 197.8 Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
At 27 June 2009, the Group had two interest rate swaps totalling 100.0m, fixing the interest on part of the variable rate syndicated loan.
50.0m was fixed at 2.01% plus margin until December 2011 and 50.0m was fixed at 2.39% plus margin until December 2012.
To date these two interest swaps have resulted in a realised loss of 0.2m.
These swaps result in a net floating rate asset of 50.3m and a net fixed rate liability of 141.3m at 27 June 2009.
Hence the adverse risk at year end is a decrease in interest rates.
During the current year, the Group entered into an interest rate swap totalling 150.0m, fixing the interest on part of the variable rate syndicated loan at 6.4%.
The interest rate swap covered the six months period October 2008 to March 2009 and resulted in a realised loss of 1.8m.
During the year ended 2008, the Group took out a variable interest rate swap on a 100.0m drawdown of the syndicated loan.
This was designated as a cashflow hedge of the interest on the loan, and a loss of 0.2m was recognised in the income statement.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
Effect on Increase profit decrease in before tax basis points m 2009 GBP 50 0.7 GBP 50 0.7 2008 GBP 50 0.7 GBP 50 0.7 Liquidity risk The Group has in place a 340.0m syndicated loan facility which allows the Group to maintain liquidity within the desired gearing range.
The level of drawdown and prevailing interest rates are detailed in note 20.
The Groups road passenger vehicles are also financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over two to five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
Foreign currency risk The Group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material.
Should larger foreign currency transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign currency exchange risk.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash deposits see note 17.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows.
The majority of the Groups receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies such as the DfT.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
Risk of exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated A or Aa3 or above with at least one of the agencies.
Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with any one given financial institution.
Contractual payments The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 27 June 2009 based on contractual undiscounted payments.
Year ended 27 June 2009 Less than 3 On demand months 3 to 12 months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 5.0 16.5 18.6 291.2 331.3 Other financial liabilities 4.1 12.3 8.5 24.9 Trade and other payables 48.1 263.6 37.5 4.6 353.8 53.1 284.2 68.4 304.3 710.0 Year ended 28 June 2008 3 to 12 Less than 3 On demand months Months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 5.7 19.5 35.7 381.6 0.2 442.7 Trade and other payables 43.7 216.1 62.8 2.5 0.5 325.6 49.4 235.6 98.5 384.1 0.7 768.3 Managing capital The Group manages its capital structure such that net debt adjusted to exclude restricted cash, to EBITDA before exceptionals is within a range which retains an investment grade debt rating.
Adjusted net debt at the year end was 272.3m 2008: 320.7m, equivalent to 1.57x 2008: 1.65x EBITDA in line with the Groups aim to move to an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle.
92 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Operating leases The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This results in 0.4m 2008: 0.4m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 9.5m 2008: 6.4m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial instruments carried in the financial statements have been reviewed as at 27 June 2009 and are as follows: 2009 2008 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 21.7 21.7 27.3 27.3 Interest rate derivatives 0.5 0.5 Fixed rate debt 24.8 25.5 25.5 23.9 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 16.5 16.5 34.3 34.3 62.5 63.2 32.5 30.9 The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 17, 19 and 20 is not significantly different to their carrying amount.
The fuel price derivatives were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cashflows at prevailing rates.
Hedging activities Fuel derivatives The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place.
For the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years cashflow hedges were placed over 125, 113, 38, 6 and 1 million litres of fuel respectively.
The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the balance sheet.
The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices.
As at 27 June 2009 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 109 million litres for the year ending 3 July 2010, representing approximately 98% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division.
As at 27 June 2009 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years of 100, 25, 3 and 1 million litres respectively.
As at 27 June 2009 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 16 million litres for the year ending 3 July 2010, representing the anticipated fuel usage in London Midland and Southern.
As at 27 June 2009 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 financial years of 13, 13 and 3 millions litres of rail fuel respectively.
The Groups hedging policy for the target percentage of anticipated bus fuel usage hedged for the next year and subsequent two years, and its compliance with that policy at the year ended 27 June 2009 is as follows: 2010 2011 2012 Percentage to hedge per Group policy 100% 50% 25% Actual percentage hedged 98% 89% 22% The gains and losses on instruments used for hedging fuel price risk are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties and other items.
Renewals are at the option of the lessee.
There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.

To support subsidiary companies in their normal course of business, the Group has indemnified certain banks and insurance companies who have issued certain performance bonds and letters of credit.
Pensions Retirement benefit obligations consist of the following: 2009 2008 m m Non-rail pension scheme liabilities 76.0 59.4 Rail pension scheme liabilities 7.5 Pre-tax pension liabilities 83.5 59.4 Deferred tax asset 23.4 16.6 Post tax pension scheme liabilities 60.1 42.8 Non-rail schemes The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan For the majority of non-rail employees, the Group operates one main pension scheme, The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan the Go-Ahead Plan, which consists of a funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution section as follows: The defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants.
The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 4.9m 2008: 4.5m being the contributions paid and payable.
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared.
The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in the Groups financial statements according to IAS 19.
Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that company.
The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan.
These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The schemes are closed to new entrants, however eligible employees can join the defined contribution section of the The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
Other pension arrangements A small number of employees in aviance have access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements as part of legacy agreements.
The expense recognised for this is 0.3m 2008: 0.4m, being the contributions paid.
The Railways Pension Scheme the RPS The majority of employees in our train operating companies are members of sections of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
96 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 In addition to the defined benefit cost, BRASS matching AVC company contributions of 0.9m 2008: 0.7m were paid in the year.
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.
Summary of year end assumptions 2009 2008 % % Price inflation 3.4 3.8 Discount rate 6.3 6.2 Rate of increase in salaries 4.4 5.3 Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferred pension 3.4 3.8 in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP element.
The discount rate is based on the anticipated return of AA rated corporate bonds with a term matching the maturity of the scheme liabilities.
The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
The table below shows the life expectancy assumptions used in the accounting assessments based on the life expectancy of a male member of each pension scheme at age 65.
Rail Non-rail 2009 2008 2009 2008 Years Years Years Years Pensioner 20 20 19 18 Non-Pensioner 22 22 20 19 The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes i. e. equities and bonds.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets suggested by the yields available, and the views of investment organisations.
Sensitivity analysis In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used.
The following is an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of the change in the key assumptions.

Consequently the Directors are unable to determine the amounts of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group SORIE before 3 July 2004.

Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations.
In all other respects the Groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes.
In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 and departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.
If the Group had accounted for the rail schemes in accordance with the full provisions of IAS 19 the following adjustments would have been made to the financial statements: 2009 2008 m m Balance sheet Defined benefit pension plan 223.8 156.8 Deferred tax asset 56.7 36.8 Intangible asset 21.2 25.4 145.9 94.6 Statement of recognised income and expense Actuarial losses 57.3 152.3 Tax on actuarial losses 16.0 42.6 41.3 109.7 Income statement Operating costs franchise adjustment 9.8 Intangible asset amortisation 4.1 3.7 Deferred tax charge 1.6 1.1 4.1 2.6 IAS 19 disclosures All of the above plans have been accounted for under IAS 19 covering employee benefits.
