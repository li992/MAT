The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Under these plans, employees are entitled to retirement benefits dependent on the number of years service provided.
The principal assumptions for the purpose of valuation under IAS19 Employee Benefits are determined for each scheme in conjunction with the respective schemes independent actuaries and are presented below as the weighted average of the various defined benefit pension schemes.
The defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31 December of the prior year.
As at 31 December 2009 2008 2007 Discount rate 5.8% 6.2% 5.9% Expected rate of return on scheme assets 7.0% 7.1% 7.1% Expected rate of salary increases 4.0% 3.7% 4.4% Inflation 3.1% 2.7% 3.1% Future pension increases 3.1% 2.8% 3.2% The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant market indices and market expectations of real rates of return.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on the weighted average of each asset category.
Mortality assumptions used in assessing defined benefit obligations make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics and the actuaries expectations for each scheme.
The average life expectancies assumed in the valuation of the defined benefit obligations are set out below.

As at 31 December 2009 the defined benefit obligations comprise 3,172m 2008: 2,923m in relation to funded schemes and 130m 2008: 128m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 19 years 2008: 19 years.
Deferred tax liabilities of 31m 2008: 44m and deferred tax assets of 122m 2008: 190m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme surpluses and deficits respectively.

Sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgements about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual net pension expense and the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: Decrease increase in annual net pension expense 5 Decrease increase in defined benefit pension obligations 143 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 5 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 75 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 6 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 122 Additionally, the annual net pension expense includes an expected return on scheme assets.
A 5% increase decrease in the market value of equity investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes would, absent any change in their expected long term rate of return, increase decrease the amount of the expected return on scheme assets by 8m and would increase decrease the amount of the net pension surplus by 91m.
