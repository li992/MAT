These costs are expected to be incurred at various intervals over the next 27 years.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current prices, escalated at 2.5%, and discounted at 7%.
The economic life and the timing of the decommissioning liabilities are dependent on Government legislation, commodity price and the future production profiles of the respective production and development facilities.
In addition, the costs of decommissioning are subject to inflationary deflationary pressures in the cost of third party service provision.
An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial Financial instruments instruments is set out in the Financial Review on pages 34 to 35 of this report, and in note 2 on 23 pages 66 to 72.
Nature and extent of risk associated with financial instruments Market risk As an upstream oil & gas company, the Company is subject to many risks, at both the macro and micro level, including currency, interest and credit risk, arising in the normal course of the Groups business.
The Business Review on pages 7 and 8 describes these risks in more detail, but also provides the Companys view of the principal risks facing the Company that potentially have a medium to high impact on the Company.
In particular, this highlights a number of risks which have emerged as a result of the rapid deterioration of the global economy into recession and the liquidity and credit crises in the world banking markets.
Risks such as inability to finance work programmes, or potential default of coventurers and suppliers are all now higher profile risks facing the sector and the Company.
During 2009, the Company secured a new source of bank funding for the next three years and continues to generally partner with larger, wellestablished upstream companies, so believes it has substantially mitigated these risks.
The Company has a geographically diverse portfolio of assets and remains unhedged with respect to commodity price, interest rates and currency fluctuations.
Specific financial instrument risks are therefore deemed to be of low probability in nature and of low impact in quantum relative to the macro risks highlighted above.
It is against this backdrop and context that the following disclosure on the nature and extent of risks from financial instruments is provided.
Financial assets and liabilities: credit risk The financial assets of the Group are subject to floating charges provided to the debt provider for the new debt facility secured during the year note 20.
As such the financial assets are subject to certain terms and conditions further explained below which help preserve the credit worthiness of the asset to the debt providers.
Cash and cash equivalents Unless agreed otherwise, all such balances must be maintained with institutions party to the debt facility.
The Group may however, make money market deposits for up to six months duration and up to 40,000,000, with any institution whose senior unsecured credit and unguaranteed long term corporate debt rating is at least equivalent to Standard and Poors AA-.
87 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2009 Additional information Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Trade and other receivables Financial instruments The Groups exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is minimal.
The Group does not have 23 continued a trading arm, but sells produced hydrocarbons only to recognised and creditworthy parties, typically the trading arm of large, international oil & gas companies.
European crudes sales are primarily sold under an annual contract at agreed premia or discounts to Brent, depending upon crude quality.
Sales are typically generated on a monthly entitlement basis rather than crude liftings to facilitate regular cashflow.
Sales of gas are either sold under long-term contracts with built-in escalation mechanisms or under annual contracts at day ahead pricing.
European credit terms normally require settlement within 15 days of invoicing and accordingly impairment exposure is minimal, a fact supported by track record.
In recent years, the ageing profile of trade and other receivables has been extended due to the operations in Egypt.
Egyptian crude is sold predominantly to government organisations but also to large international trading companies.
Country practice is for much extended credit terms of up to 120 days, but particularly with the government organisations there is also an established practice of offsetting liabilities due to the counterparty, which facilitates the management of such receivables.
Management of this extended credit exposure is one of the key objectives of the Egyptian business unit management team.
During 2009 a further extension of credit terms was experienced in Egypt as a result of the global economic conditions.
Also in Egypt, the Groups operations in the East Zeit field, provides infrastructure access and logistics support services to third parties operating in the same locale.
These other receivables occasionally prove problematic to collect and require active pursuit by management.
The level of such receivables was significantly reduced in 2009.
Past practice would also indicate that any impairment exposure is not material in the context of the Egyptian business.
As of 26 March 2010 78.1% of receivables outstanding at the year end have been collected.
An ageing analysis of trade receivables is disclosed in note 15.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date as set out in the summary table below.
Financial assets and liabilities: Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due.
This is a core management activity and is regularly reviewed by Directors.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are amongst the matters considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with the Groups shortand long-term forecast information.
In addition, and as part of the information undertakings under the debt facilities, the Company has to demonstrate covenant compliance at six monthly intervals and on a projected basis to the facility maturity date.
Cash and cash equivalents As at 31 December 2009, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 67,550,000 2008: 158,948,000.
Borrowings and financial liabilities The Groups interests are predominantly non-operated in nature and payments to suppliers occur only after goods and or services have been received.
For operated activity, material or long-term contracts will generally only be awarded after a tender process, where supplier creditworthiness will be evaluated.
Also where a drilling management contractor has been engaged, specific contractual arrangements have been put in place to govern and control the disbursement of funds by the intermediary.
During 2009, the Group agreed a USD 400 million revolving credit facility with the Bank of Scotland which has secured funding and cashflow for the Group for the next three years, during an environment when access to liquidity was extremely difficult.
The revolving nature of the facility allows the Company to draw and repay funds at its discretion to facilitate cash management.
The facility is required to be repaid by maturity.
The Group also continued to service the coupon on the 2014 Guaranteed Convertible Bond.
The Convertible Bond has an investor put in July 2012.
An analysis of the maturity profile of the Groups borrowing financial liabilities is shown in note 20a and details of the underlying facilities are detailed in note 20b and note 21.
The undiscounted cash flows associated with the maturity profile of non-current borrowings and financial liabilities is noted on the following table.

Financial assets and liabilities: Interest rate risk Details of the Groups interest rate risk profile on financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
The fixed rate and competitive nature of the Convertible debt coupon of 2.9% per annum, provides excellent protection against the risk of changes in market interest rates and complements the variable interest rate applicable to the Bank debt.
USD, GBP and NOK LIBOR rates underpin the Bank debt and remain low as governments continue to use interest rates to fight recessionary pressures.
Accordingly in 2009, the Group continued to enjoy an extremely low cost of finance and profits provided adequate interest cover.

At 31 December 2009, short-term deposits and liquid investments were earning interest at a weighted average fixed deposit rate of 1.31% 2008: 3.78%.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on a discount to USD GBP LIBOR.

The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are noninterest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on its financial liabilities.
If the interest rates for the year were to have changed by - 1% in 2009, with all other variables held constant, it is estimated that the Groups profit before tax for 2009 would have increased by 2,901,000 decreased by 2,345,000 2008: increased decreased 1,531,000.
There would be no impact on equity.
89 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2009 Additional information Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Financial assets and liabilities: Currency risk Financial instruments The predominant functional currency within the Group is sterling but due to the Groups USD 23 continued denominated oil production and USD denominated debt facility, the Group does remain exposed to fluctuations in the USD currency, the primary area of currency risk.
Such exposures can be hedged against using financial instruments but the Group takes the view that this would be inconsistent with the Groups unhedged position on commodity price, given the historic inverse correlation between movements in the price of oil and movements in the USD.
Whilst this approach may give rise to currency exchange gains and losses, these are in effect largely offset by corresponding gains and losses in the value of crude oil sales.
Egyptian activities are undertaken by USD reporting entities given that this is the main currency of the underlying operations, with only a relatively minor exposure to Egyptian pounds.
This creates exposure to currency translation risks which is mitigated by the USD bank debt drawn by the UK subsidiary which acquired these entities.
Once again this may give rise to currency gains and losses, but these will be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the underlying financial results of the Egyptian subsidiaries.
Dana Petroleum Norway AS has a functional currency of NOK, the predominant source currency of the Companys cost base.
Revenues, being generated from crude sales are however, USD denominated.
In cash terms the Group is short GBP and NOK, and long USD.
The Group is however, able to make deposits of USD, on a dual or tri-currency basis, where in return for pre-agreed exchange rates, and interest yields significantly ahead of vanilla USD deposit rates, the Group grants the counterparty the right to return the original deposit, in the nominated currency of their choice, namely USD, GBP or NOK.
Using this mechanism the Group has been able to achieve deposit yields much higher than those available on vanilla USD deposits.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity.
