The address of the registered office is 5th Floor, 21 Palmer Street, London, SW1H 0AD.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are as an independent oil and gas exploration, development and production company focused on building a portfolio of assets in Southeast Asia.
Financial information The financial information is presented in US Dollars.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with policies set out later in this section.
At the date of authorisation of this financial information, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in this financial information were in issue but are not yet effective: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 1 amended Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters IFRS 2 amended Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IAS 24 revised 2009 Related Party Disclosures IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised 2008 Investment in Associates IAS 32 amended Classification of Rights Issues IFRIC 14 amended Prepayment of a Minimum Funding Requirement IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Improvements to IFRSs 2009 Not yet endorsed by EU.
Improvements with effective date 1 January 2010 have not yet been endorsed by EU.
The Directors anticipate the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
Accounting policies and presentation of financial information Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU, IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as set out in the Directors Report.
47 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Statement of accounting policies and general information continued Basis of preparation continued The separate financial statements of the Parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by the Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies are the same as those set out in the Accounting Policies in this section.
As a consolidated income statement is included, a separate income statement for the Parent Company has not been included in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The profit for the year for the Parent Company is disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity to the Company financial statements.
Adoption of new accounting standards In the current financial year, the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard 8 Operating Segments, International Accounting Standard 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007 and International Accounting Standard 23 Borrowing Costs March 2007.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group.
The adoption of IFRS 8 has had no effect on the identified operating segments for the Group which are also the reportable segments.
IAS 1 revised requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and statement of other comprehensive income.
As a result, a consolidated statement of changes in equity has been included in the primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
As the Group has no other losses in the periods presented, no statement of other comprehensive income is included.
IAS 23 March 2007 had no impact on the Group, as the Group already capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets under its existing accounting policies.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements consist of the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenues and the results of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated in the consolidated income statement from the dates on which control over the operating and financial decisions is obtained.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of Subsidiary and Joint Venture Entities to bring the Accounting Policies into line to those used by the Group.
Commercial reserves Commercial reserves are proved and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially viable.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Where a Group Company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the Groups share of jointly-controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other ventures are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant company and classified according to their nature.
48 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Joint ventures continued Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly-controlled assets are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Income from the sale or use of the Groups share of the output of jointly-controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to from the Group and their amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly-controlled entities.
The Group reports its interest in jointly-controlled entities using proportionate consolidation, that is, the Groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly-controlled entities are combined with the equivalent items in consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly-controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
Acquisitions On an acquisition that qualifies as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combination, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill which is treated as an intangible asset.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the Income Statement in the period of acquisition.
If the Group acquires a group of assets or equity in a company that does not constitute a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combination, the cost of the acquired group of assets or equity is allocated to the individual identifiable assets acquired based on their relative fair value.
Revenue Revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and equivalent taxes, and overriding royalties, of the Groups share of liftings in the period together with tariff income.
Revenue received under take-or-pay sales contracts in respect of undelivered volumes is accounted for as deferred income.
Revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest revenue Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in oil and gas prices interest rates and foreign exchange.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The purpose for which a derivative is used is established at inception.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be highly effective in achieving its objective and this effectiveness must be documented at inception and throughout the period of the instrument designation.
Gains or losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment either from inception or during the life of the instrument are taken directly to the Income Statement in the period.
These include economic hedges that might qualify as accounting hedges, but were not designated as such at inception.
The estimated fair value of these derivatives is included in other creditors or other debtors in the Balance Sheet and the related changes in the fair value are included in finance costs in the Income Statement.
Upfront contract fees and realised gains and losses upon settlement are included within revenue in the Income Statement over the hedged period.
During 2009 and 2008 there were no derivatives that were designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
49 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Statement of accounting policies and general information continued Cost of sales Underlift and overlift Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Groups jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period.
The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative production is underlift or overlift.
Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through Cost of Sales such that Gross Profit is recognised on an entitlements basis.
Share based payment The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payment.
The Group makes equity settled Share Based Payment to certain employees.
Equity settled share based schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant of the equity settled Share Based Payment is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The expenses so recognised are simultaneously added back as an adjustment through equity.
Operating leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Foreign currencies The US Dollar is the presentation currency of the Group.
On consolidation, financial statements of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into US Dollars whereby the results of the overseas operations are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period and their balance sheets at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Currency translation adjustments arising on the restatement of opening net assets of foreign subsidiaries, together with differences between the subsidiaries results translated at average rates versus closing rates, are taken directly to reserves.
All resulting exchange differences are classified as equity until disposal of the subsidiary.
On disposal the cumulative amounts of the exchange differences are recognised as income or expense.
Transactions in foreign currencies in individual subsidiaries are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the transaction dates.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the Income Statement.
Finance costs and debt Finance costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt is shown on the balance sheet net of arrangement fees and issue costs, and amortised through to the income statement as finance costs over the term of the debt.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Taxation Current and deferred tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas corporation tax, are provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred corporation tax is recognised on all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to 50 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Taxation continued the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on acquisitions that are categorised as business combinations.
Deferred tax is recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
Any deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement as the underlying temporary difference is reversed.
Exploration and evaluation assets The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by well, field or exploration area, as appropriate.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration and development activities.
Pre-licence costs are expensed in the period they are incurred.
If prospects are deemed to be impaired unsuccessful on completion of an evaluation, the associated capitalised costs are charged to the Income Statement.
If the field is determined to be commercially viable, the attributable costs are transferred to Property, Plant and Equipment in a single field cost centre.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and depreciation.
Oil and gas properties Oil and gas properties expenditures carried within each field are amortised from the commencement of production, on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus the production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs.
The production and reserve estimates used in the calculation are on an entitlements basis.
Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions including commodity assumptions and cost of capital that indicate a possible impairment of a field previously determined to be commercially viable, the recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash flows based on managements expectations of future oil and gas prices and future costs.
Any impairment identified is charged to the Income Statement as additional depreciation, depletion and amortisation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed, where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to decommission.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment.
The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision, and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning provision is included as Finance Costs.
Other fixed assets Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas properties, is depreciated at rates calculated to write-off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life of between three and five years.
51 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Statement of accounting policies and general information continued Investments Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture entities held by the Company as non-current assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Share issue expenses and share premium account Costs of share issues are written off against the premium arising on the issue of share capital.
Inventories Inventories of oil and gas are stated at their net realisable values.
Inventories of materials are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for all debt instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss FVTPL Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where the Group acquires the financial asset principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, the financial asset is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short term profit taking as well as all derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
All impairment losses are taken to the Income Statement.
Trade receivables are assessed for impairment based on the number of days outstanding on individual invoices.
Any trade receivable that is deemed uncollectible is immediately written off to the income statement, any subsequent recoveries are also taken directly to the income statement upon receipt of cash collected.
52 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire: or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Critical judgements and accounting estimates In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described above, management has made judgements and estimates that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Management is required to assess the level of the Groups commercial reserves together with the future expenditures to access those reserves, which are utilised in determining the amortisation and depreciation charge for the period and assessing whether any impairment charge is required.
The Group employs independent reserves specialists who periodically report on the Groups level of commercial reserves by evaluating the estimates of Salamanders in house reserves specialists and where necessary referencing geological, geophysical and engineering data together with reports, presentation and financial information pertaining to the contractual and fiscal terms applicable to the Groups assets.
In addition the Group undertakes its own assessment of commercial reserves and related future capital expenditure by reference to the same datasets using its own internal expertise.
The estimates adopted by the Group may differ from the independent reserves specialists estimates where management considers that adjustments are appropriate in the circumstances.
Management is required to assess intangible fixed assets for impairment with reference to the indicators provided in IFRS 6 Exploration for Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements discloses the carrying value of such assets.
53 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Statement of accounting policies and general information continued Critical judgements and accounting estimates continued Management is required to determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired under a business combination including the cost of the acquisition and allocate a fair value cost to the underlying assets acquired.
Management is required to review and potentially test property plant and equipment for impairment usually by estimating a pre-tax value in use for each asset held and comparing that value to the book value of the asset being carried in the balance sheet.
Management, in regard to the BNPP led reserves based lending facility, is required to estimate the amount of borrowings that are classified as a due within one year and the amount that is classified as due after one year, as the calculations are based on uncertain future assumptions such as oil price and other economic factors.
Management has determined that for certain assets the Group does not need to make provisions for decommissioning because: i the contracts covering the Groups operations do not provide for the Group to decommission its oil and gas properties: and ii the fields in question are expected to continue producing for substantial periods after the contracts expire and therefore the costs will be incurred by other parties unless the Group agrees to extend these contracts.
Management is required to make assumptions in respect of the inputs used to calculate the fair values of share based payment arrangements.
Details of these assumptions and the resultant charge to the income statement are provided in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Management is required to determine the fair value at the balance sheet of derivative contracts entered into.
Management is required to assess the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries in the Parent Company balance sheet for impairment by reference to the recoverable amount.
This requires an estimate of amounts recoverable from oil and gas assets within the underlying subsidiaries, which is inherently uncertain.
