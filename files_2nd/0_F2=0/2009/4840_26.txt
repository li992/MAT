Underlying profit and earnings per share measures exclude the trading results of businesses to be closed, impact of amortisation of acquired intangibles, net restructuring and business impairment charges and other one-off, non-recurring items, profit on sale of investments, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments and, where applicable, discontinued operations.
Such excluded items are described as Non-underlying.
Further information on these items is shown in notes 1, 4, 5, 7 and 29.
Businesses to be closed comprises Markantalo and PC City Sweden whereby their closures were announced on 31 March 2009 and 23 March 2009, respectively.
Owing to their closure rather than disposal, these operations do not meet the definition of discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5 and accordingly the disclosures made above differ from those for discontinued operations.
