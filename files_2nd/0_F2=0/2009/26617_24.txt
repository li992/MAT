3 Goodwill and other intangible assets Note 15 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates of future cash flows and discount rates.
An impairment review of the RMF goodwill suggested that there was a limited amount of headroom of discounted future net cash inflows over the goodwill balance and hence a sensitivity analysis in relation to the key assumptions used in the calculations is given in Note 15.
The joint venture investment in Ore Hill was impaired, based on value in use calculations, using the key assumptions set out in Note 14.

Income statement presentation The material items which the directors consider should be presented separately on the face of the income statement by virtue of their size or nature, in order to aid comparability from period to period, are as follows: 2009 $m Accelerated amortisation of MGS sales commissions 107 Restructuring costs 37 Gain on disposal of 50% of subsidiary 48 Impairment of Ore Hill investments and goodwill 299 Loss arising from residual interest in brokerage assets 105 500 a Accelerated amortisation of MGS sales commissions As a result of the MGS fide-risking process, an accelerated amortisation charge of $107 million $86 million after adjusting for variable compensation has been recognised in respect of upfront sales commissions associated with MGS products.
Following the decision to fide-risk many of the MGS products, the useful economic life of these products was reviewed and reduced.
Therefore the amortisation has been accelerated.
b Restructuring costs In March 2009 the Group announced that it has implemented a plan to reduce the cost base of the business.
The one-off compensation costs associated with this restructuring are reported as Restructuring costs.
c Gain on disposal of 50% of subsidiary Impairment of Ore Hill investments and goodwill On 8 May 2008, the Group acquired a 50% interest in Ore Hill, a major US-based credit specialist fund manager.
Simultaneously the Ore Hill principals acquired a 50% interest in Pemba Credit Advisers Pemba, the European credit manager subsidiary of the Group.
A gain of $48 million arose on the disposal of 50% of Pemba, which is included in the income statement.
Since this disposal, the credit markets have continued to deteriorate, which has severely affected the Pemba business.
Accordingly, Pemba has been restructured and as part of this exercise, in February 2009, the Group took back its 50% shareholding from the Ore Hill principals at nil cost, with no further profit or loss arising.
As a result of the deterioration in market conditions since the date of the acquisition of Ore Hill and the decrease in assets under management arising from significant redemptions during the period, the Group has recognised an impairment charge of $214 million against the carrying value of the Ore Hill investment.
The assumptions used in the impairment review are discussed in Note 14.
The discount rates used to perform the impairment exercise are higher than the rates used at the time of the acquisition as the discount rates applied are determined based on the current market conditions and reflect the deterioration in the financial markets and debt rates and the higher risk of returns as at 31 March 2009.
The carrying value of the Groups interest in Ore Hills Designated Investment DI portfolio was reviewed for impairment as at 31 March 2009.
The impairment charge booked as a result of this review was $75 million, which is included with the impairment against the Ore Hill investment within Impairment of Ore Hill investments and goodwill, together with a further $10 million charge relating to the impairment of MTM Capital goodwill.
d Loss arising from residual interest in brokerage assets As discussed in Note 12, following the disposal of its brokerage business the Group retained a residual investment in MF Global.
These shares, which are classified as available-for-sale financial assets, have been reviewed for impairment as at 31 March 2009, following a significant decrease in the underlying share price, resulting in an impairment charge of $126 million being taken through the income statement.
Other net gains of $21 million arose from the Groups residual interest in brokerage assets during the year.

ii Share-based payments These are detailed in section b of this Note.
iii Phantom equity-based compensation The Group also operates phantom cash-settled, equity-based compensation plans.
The equity base is typically some of the fund products of which the Group is the investment manager.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the phantom equity awards is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, remeasured at each reporting date until the settlement date is reached.
The fair value of the awards equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at the settlement date.

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings per share and return on equity targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions made on the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
All of the employee share awards and share option awards were made within the Groups share-based remuneration schemes.
Details of these schemes may be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60.
During the year, $86 million was charged to the income statement for equity-settled, share-based payment transactions 2008: $71 million in respect of continuing operations.
Financial Performance Man Group plc Annual Report 2009 85 3.
Employees and compensation continued The fair value of share options and awards at grant date is calculated using a binomial lattice model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Financial assumptions include the future share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and the best estimate outcome of non-market based performance conditions.
Demographic assumptions include forfeiture and early vesting behaviours that are based upon historic observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the year to employees, and the assumptions used in the calculations, are as follows: Executive Other share employee option share option Performance Deferred scheme schemes share plan share plan Grant dates 12 6 2008 1 7 20081 8 2008 12 6 2008 29 5 20088 12 2008 Weighted average share price at grant date $ 12.19 12.29 12.19 7.84 Weighted average exercise price at grant date $ 12.19 9.86 Share options awards made in the year 263,594 424,126 1,585,372 15,851,785 Vesting period years 3 25 4 4 Expected share price volatility 30% 30% Dividend yield 4% 4% 4% 414% Risk-free rate 5.3% 5.2% Expected option life years 7.7 3.3 Number of shares options assumed to vest 263,594 322,180 1,585,372 14,404,677 Average fair value per option share granted $ 3.44 2.47 10.42 6.43 The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility over the last 10 years.
The expected option life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon US and UK where appropriate government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
It is assumed that the performance conditions applicable to the executive share option scheme and performance share plan will be met in full.
For the executive share option scheme, it is assumed that 5% of options per year are subject to early exercise, and in addition, provided there is a gain of 50% on the exercise price, it is assumed that 50% of remaining option holders will exercise per year.

c Pension benefits The Group operates various pension plans throughout the world, including a number of defined contribution plans and two funded defined benefit plans.
The Groups pension plans are funded through payments to trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
i Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as compensation when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined contribution pension costs for continued operations totalled $11 million 2008: $9 million.
ii Defined benefit plans The two defined benefit plans operated by the Group are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland the Swiss plan.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The present values of the defined benefit obligations are determined using the projected unit credit method by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The defined benefit obligation for the UK plan is based on a funding valuation performed as at 31 December 2005, with results projected forward by independent qualified actuaries.
The latest regular triennial valuation of the UK plan is being conducted as at 31 December 2008.
The level of contributions paid by the Group to the UK plan will be reviewed once the results of this valuation are known and this may result in a revised level of contributions being agreed between the Group and the UK plan trustees is due effective 31 December 2008.
Once the results of this valuation are known the funding of the plan will be reviewed by the Group and UK plan Trustees and contribution rates adjusted in accordance with recommendations made by the independent actuaries.
The obligation for the Swiss plan was calculated as at 31 March 2009 by independent qualified actuaries.
At 31 March 2009, the UK plan comprised 76% 2008: 83% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
In accordance with the transitional provisions set out in IFRS 1 First time adoption of international financial reporting standards, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of the Groups IFRS transition 1 April 2004 were recognised in full.
Since 1 April 2004, actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are not recognised in the current period unless the cumulative unrecognised gain or loss at the end of the previous reporting period exceeds the greater of 10% of the plan assets or liabilities.
In these circumstances the excess is charged or credited to the income statement over the employees expected average remaining working lives.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

In the UK, investment market conditions suggest an expected return on equities of around 8.0% 2008: 8.3%, expected bond returns of around 5.3% 2008: 5.4%, expected return on hedge funds of around 8.0% 2008: 8.3% and expected average return on other plan assets of around 4.2% 2008: 5.1%.
In 2008, the Swiss plan was invested in an insurance contract, on which the expected return was 3.25%.
This year, the Swiss plan investments were moved to a pension foundation, and Swiss investment market conditions suggest an expected return on equities of around 7.2%, expected bond returns of around 3.4%, expected returns on property of 4.4%, expected hedge fund returns of around 5.8% and expected average return on other plan assets of around 2.0%.
Mortality rates in the UK plan are assumed to be in line with the PNA00 tables projected by year of birth with allowance for future improvements in mortality rates in line with the medium cohort projections with a minimum rate of improvement each year of 1.0% for males and 0.5% for females.
The table below sets out the implied life expectancy at age 60 for members currently aged 60 and for members reaching age 60 in 20 years time.
Life Current life expectancy expectancy in 20 years years time years Male aged 60 27.1 29.3 Female aged 60 29.1 30.3 Mortality rates in the Swiss plan are assumed to be in line with the Swiss BVG 2005 standard table plus a 0.5% per annum allowance for increase in life expectancy from the date of the census underlying the table to the valuation date.

Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on a profit for the year of $485 million 2008: $1,717 million for continuing operations, and a profit for the year of $485 million 2008: $3,471 million for continuing and discontinued operations.
The calculation of basic EPS is based on 1,687,787,700 2008: 1,848,517,328 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after excluding the shares owned by the Man Group plc employee trusts.
During the year to 31 March 2008 each ordinary share of 3 US cents was consolidated on a 7 shares for 8 share basis following the return of capital to shareholders by means of a B and C share issue.
The effect of the change in the number of shares was recorded prospectively.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The diluted EPS is based on a profit for the year of $485 million 2008: $1,722 million for continuing operations, and a profit for the year of $485 million 2008: $3,476 million for continuing and discontinued operations.
The calculation of diluted EPS for continuing and discontinued operations is based on 1,707,878,896 2008: 1,909,455,999 ordinary shares, calculated as shown in the following table: 2009 2008 Total Weighted Total Weighted number average number average millions millions millions millions Number of shares at 1 April 1,715.3 1,715.3 1,880.0 1,880.0 Issues of shares 23.2 7.9 126.2 96.3 Share consolidation 245.0 84.3 Repurchase and cancellation of own shares 30.6 17.9 45.9 31.2 Number of shares at 31 March 1,707.9 1,705.3 1,715.3 1,860.8 Shares owned by employee trusts 28.9 17.5 7.7 12.3 Basic number of shares 1,679.0 1,687.8 1,707.6 1,848.5 Share awards under incentive schemes 29.2 19.5 20.3 29.6 Employee share options 4.6 0.6 6.3 4.2 Exchangeable bonds 27.2 Dilutive number of shares 1,712.8 1,707.9 1,734.2 1,909.5 The reconciliation of EPS from continuing and discontinued operations, to EPS from continuing operations, is given in the table below: Year to 31 March 2009 Year to 31 March 2008 Basic Diluted Basic Diluted Basic Diluted Basic Diluted post-tax post-tax earnings earnings post-tax post-tax earnings earnings earnings earnings per share per share earnings earnings per share per share $m $m cents cents $m $m cents cents Earnings per share on continuing and 1 discontinued operations 485 485 28.7 28.4 3,471 3,476 187.7 182.0 Discontinued operations 1,754 1,754 94.9 91.8 1 Earnings per share on continuing operations 485 485 28.7 28.4 1,717 1,722 92.8 90.2 The reconciliation from EPS on continuing operations to an adjusted EPS on continuing operations is given below for the current period.

Financial risk and capital management Financial risk management A qualitative analysis of the financial risks arising from the Groups activities is included in the Risk Management section on pages 41 to 43 of this Annual Report.
a Liquidity risk management The Groups strategy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to give it the flexibility to support the business through different market conditions and business cycles.
The amount of the potential requirement for liquidity is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market conditions, including reduced bank advance rates, fide-risking of FUM, investor redemption bridging requirements, gating by underlying managers and the risk of a substantial adverse move in AHL and the consequential request to fund margin calls in those structured products that include an AHL allocation.
Although the majority of these liquidity requirements are discretionary, the Board believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet these stressed modelled scenarios.
The Group finances its operations using the cash flow generated by its operations, a committed syndicated bank facility and finance raised in the capital markets.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had a committed bank facility of $2.43 billion 2008: $2.83 billion, which was undrawn, and total debt of $650 million 2008: $400 million.

Financial risk and capital management continued Further explanation of financial guarantees and commitments are included in section d below, including separate disclosure of the commitments arising from Empyrean Re.
During the year there were $15 million net realised and unrealised gains arising from derivative financial instruments 2008: $42 million net gains.
The notional value of forward foreign exchange contracts is $73 million 2008: $287 million.
The notional value of the foreign exchange swaps is $881 million 2008: $1,182 million.
Details of the Empyrean Re credit default swap are disclosed separately below.
All contracts mature within one year.
b Market risk management i Investment in fund products The Company invests in early stage managers as part of its ongoing business to build investment capacity.
These investments are generally held for less than one year, at which point the investment is redeemed and either investor funds allocated, or the account closed.
The Group calculates the market risk on these investments using a value at risk VaR methodology using a one month time horizon, at a 95% confidence interval.
The increase in the VaR in 2009 compared with 2008 reflects the higher average level of seed investments and the increase in historical volatilities.
2009 2008 VaR VaR Other investments Other investments in fund products Close Average Maximum Minimum in fund products Close Average Maximum Minimum $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m 718 53 90 120 53 1,279 70 59 72 51 ii Residual investment in MF Global and other assets The Groups residual investment in MF Global $94 million and exchange shares $28 million are held as available-for-sale financial assets, where gains and losses arising from movements in the share price are recorded in the available-for-sale reserve within equity.
An impairment charge of $126 million was recorded through the income statement for the year, in respect of the Groups residual investment in MF Global see Note 2.
The market risk on the holdings in MF Global and exchange shares, using a VaR methodology with a one month time horizon and at a 95% confidence interval is $30 million and $9 million respectively 2008: MF Global $51 million, exchange shares $20 million.
The Group owns an investment in Ore Hills DI portfolio, which holds long-term interests of a less liquid nature in a number of underlying entities.
This investment is classified as available-for-sale, based on the fair value of the interests in the underlying companies.
The carrying value at year-end of $52 million is stated after the impairment charge of $75 million, discussed in Note 2 c. The market risk on the holdings in the Ore Hill DI portfolio, using a VaR methodology with a one month time horizon and at a 95% confidence interval is $23 million 2008: not held.
iii Foreign exchange and interest rate risk The Groups net assets are exposed to the effect of movements in the exchange rate on financial assets and liabilities where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary.
The main foreign exchange sensitivity is to fluctuations in the US dollar exchange rate against sterling, euro and Swiss franc balances.
The Group, from time to time, puts in place short-term foreign currency contracts to hedge these costs.
At 31 March 2009, a 10% strengthening weakening of the US dollar against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $12 million, with a corresponding impact on equity.
In respect of those of the Groups monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 March 2009, a 50bp increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $10 million increase decrease in net interest income, with a corresponding impact on equity.
c Credit risk management Financial assets subject to credit risk are as follows: 2009 2008 Note $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 10 2,361 1,876 Included in trade and other receivables: 11 Derivative financial instruments 10 1 Other receivables 345 754 Amounts owed by fund products 12 373 369 3,089 3,000 The average month-end balance of amounts owed by fund products during the financial year ended 31 March 2009 was $778 million 2008: $691 million.
The maximum credit risk exposure is equivalent to the carrying value of the balances shown.
The MF Global facility and Empyrean Re commitments are disclosed separately in section d below.
Financial Performance Man Group plc Annual Report 2009 95 9.
Financial risk and capital management continued i Counterparty credit rating The Groups counterparties are externally rated and amounts owed by fund products are rated using an internal rating methodology.
At 31 March 2009 the counterparty rating of the Groups financial assets subject to counterparty risk and neither past due nor impaired was as follows: BBB to AAor better A to Aspeculative Not rated 31 March 2009 % % % % Amounts owed by fund products 6 71 23 Trade and other receivables 15 37 6 42 Derivative financial instruments 1 year 26 73 1 Cash and cash equivalents 8 92 Weighted average 9 83 3 5 BBB to AAor better A to Aspeculative Not rated 31 March 2008 % % % % Amounts owed by fund products 66 34 Trade and other receivables 32 12 2 54 Derivative financial instruments 1 year 100 Cash and cash equivalents 92 7 1 Weighted average 74 11 15 ii Ageing and impairment of financial assets Neither past Past due but not impaired due nor impaired 0-6months 6-12 months 1 year Impaired 31 March 2009 $m $m $m $m $m Amounts owed by fund products 373 Trade and other receivables 328 11 5 1 Derivative financial instruments 1 year 10 Cash and cash equivalents 2,361 3,072 11 5 1 Neither past Past due but not impaired due nor impaired 0-6months 6-12 months 1 year Impaired 31 March 2008 $m $m $m $m $m Amounts owed by fund products 369 Trade and other receivables 697 44 6 7 Derivative financial instruments 1 year 1 Cash and cash equivalents 1,876 2,943 44 6 7 No significant impairments were recorded on items exposed to credit risk in either the current or comparative financial years.
iii Concentration of credit risk At 31 March 2009, the Groups single largest counterparty exposure is $608 million held with an A rated bank 2008: $450 million.
The largest loan to a fund product was $39 million 2008: $44 million.
The amount of these exposures can change significantly each month.
d Financial guarantees and commitments i Committed purchase agreements In respect of some of its structured products, the Group has made a commitment to provide monthly liquidity for some of their underlying investments in fund products, which otherwise have only quarterly liquidity, by purchasing these shares.
This commitment allows these structured products to rebalance their portfolios and offer monthly redemption terms to investors.
Man Group plc 96 Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 9.
Financial risk and capital management continued The Groups commitment at 31 March 2009 covers investments in existing fund products totalling $954 million 2008: $2.65 billion.
The decrease during the year is principally because of the fide-risking of MGS fund products and the consequent reduction in underlying funds under management subject to CPAs.
At 31 March 2009, the aggregate risk of loss to which the Group was exposed in relation to committed purchase agreements amounted to $96 million 2008: $87 million at a one year 99.9% confidence level, taking into account the contingent nature of these exposures and the probability of a loss being incurred on any resulting holding.
ii MF Global brokerage account MF Global has put in place a $50 million daylight overdraft facility for certain funds which is guaranteed by the Group.
This guarantee has a 364 day term and can be cancelled on any day by giving notice prior to 10am.
Under normal circumstances, the Group has no exposure to the guarantee at the end of any given day.
iii Intra-day credit facility The Group guarantees an external $400 million intra-day credit facility, used to settle the majority of the funds payments.
In prior years this facility was supported within the MF Global brokerage account which has been reduced from $400 million to $50 million accordingly.
iv Loan facilities provided to fund products The Group provides committed loan facilities to the MAST structures.
These are collateralised fund obligations CFOs providing financing support to a range of Man structured products.
The facilities exist to provide liquidity and bridging facilities rather than to provide permanent leverage.
The Group manages the CFO portfolios to ensure that sufficient underlying investments are liquidated to meet ongoing fee and coupon payments.
As a result, drawings are infrequent and small in relation to the facilities available.
Utilisation under these facilities at the financial year end was as follows: 2009 2008 Commitment Utilisation Commitment Utilisation $m $m $m $m MAST 2 25 25 Man Glenwood Asset Holdings MAST 2 3 152 189 177 214 Otherwise all of the loan facilities which the Group provides to its fund products are uncommitted.
v AHL FX trading guarantee The Group guarantees all unfilled margin requirements with respect to AHL FX trading.
Margins are filled daily, two days in arrears.
At any time the Group is exposed to the unfilled margin over the previous two days.
As at 31 March 2009 the Groups exposure under this guarantee was $24 million and the average month-end balance was $28 million.
vi Commitments made by Empyrean Re Empyrean Re used to write short-term trade credit insurance and reinsurance on a global basis.
Although it ceased to write new business in August 2008 it remains exposed to credit risk during the run off period in the event that losses resulting from defaults by the underlying obligors in each reinsurance contract exceed the deductible under that contract.
Empyrean Re manages credit default risk by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of the underlying obligors and maintaining exposures within limits.
The portfolio risk is modelled taking into account each reinsurance contract including deductibles, limits, coinsurance and reinstatements using a proprietary quantitative model.
Capital market transactions are undertaken to maintain the portfolio within a risk-based limit.
Empyrean Re primarily employs Moodys KMV Expected Default Frequency EDF to determine the probability of default PD and the rating.
Credit exposures at 31 March 2009 are $238 million 2008: $548 million.
Approximately 14% of Empyrean Res credit exposures have a rating equivalent to A or better.
No single exposure is greater than $80 million.
The expected loss is nil, although the economic capital requirement at a 99.9% confidence interval is $52 million.
Empyrean Re has in place a credit default swap held with an A rated bank.
The fair value as at 31 March 2009 was $3.6 million.
e Capital management The Group monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory capital and economic capital, including monthly reporting to Finance Committee and the Group Board.
The Group has been in compliance with the Regulatory Capital requirements at all times during the year.
The Groups Financial Resources at 31 March 2009 are $2,743 million 2008: $2,619 million, as set out in the table in the Financial Review on page 72. f Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Fair value is equivalent to book value for all financial assets and liabilities, except for borrowings where the fair value represents the effects of changes in underlying market interest rates and credit spreads.
The comparison of fair value to book value for borrowings is shown in Note 18.
All other significant classes of financial assets and liabilities are held at fair value, or are held on a short-term basis, such as amounts owed by fund products.

The carrying values of loans to employees are based on cash flows discounted using an effective interest rate of 6.1% 2008: 5.3%.
Included in other receivables are fair value gains arising from derivative financial instruments of $10 million 2008: $1 million, and a $10 million premium for the option to acquire the residual 75% in Nephila Capital Ltd. see Note 24.
At 31 March 2009, $15 million 2008: $22 million of amounts owed by employees are expected to be settled after more than 12 months.
Included in other receivables are $35 million 2008: $34 million that are expected to be settled after more than 12 months.
Included in other receivables, and prepayments and accrued income, are balances of $17 million 2008: $22 million, and $42 million 2008: $115 million respectively, that relate to fee income receivable from fund products, that meet the definition of an associate entity see Note 14 and are included in the disclosures on related parties see Note 27.
A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in other expenses in the income statement.
The Group has not used allowance accounts to record individual impairments.
Financial risk disclosures with respect to trade and other receivables may be found in Note 9.
Investments in fund products and other investments Investments in fund products: Amounts owed by fund products The Group makes available both committed and uncommitted short-term loans to fund products, immediately following their launch, with the intention of providing temporary funding until more permanent financing structures are put in place with external providers.
Accordingly, the amount of loans to fund products will vary from one period to the next as a consequence of the net effect of the level of sales in the period less the quantum of the external re-financing initiative in the period.
Loans to funds are classified as loans and receivables and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Floating rate interest is received on loans to funds.
Other investments in fund products Investments in fund products are seeding investments, liquidity investments to aid investors wishing to buy and sell investments in the fund products, or investments in the equity and debt tranches of collateralised products which are the result of contractual obligations to facilitate external investment in fund products and external fund financing.
The majority of these investments are not held for the long-term and there are frequent changes in the aggregate amount of the Groups ownership of investments.
The majority of other investments in fund products are held at fair value through the income statement.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported Net Asset Values NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers VSP based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of the Group, the Group has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the net asset values reported by the VSP are reliable and appropriate.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued Other investments: Residual stake in MF Global Following the disposal of its brokerage business in July 2008 see Note 25 the Group retained a residual investment in MF Global.
These shares are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
MF Global is listed on the NYSE and the fair value of the investment in MF Global is determined by the quoted bid price at the balance sheet date.
The cumulative decrease of $126 million in fair value below cost has been treated as an impairment as at 31 March 2009 and therefore taken through the income statement for the year see Note 2 d. Investment in Ore Hill DI portfolio The Group owns an investment in Ore Hills DI portfolio, which holds long-term interests of a less liquid nature in a number of underlying entities.
This investment is classified as available-for-sale, and fair value is determined by reference to the value of the interests in the underlying companies.
The carrying value at year-end of $52 million is stated after the impairment charge of $75 million see Note 2 c. Exchange shares Exchange shares are equity instruments that provide the holder the same rights to an exchange as a market seat membership.
Exchange shares are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
The fair values of listed exchange shares are determined by the quoted bid price at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of unlisted exchange shares and memberships are determined using the exchanges internal auction process, where the last traded price is used to establish the fair value.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued Income statement classification Gains losses on investments of $260 million for the financial year include losses of $287 million on investments held at fair value through the income statement 2008: $51 million, and a gain of $27 million on available-for-sale financial assets, relating to the sale of exchange shares 2008: $nil.
Total impairment on available-for-sale financial assets taken through the income statement for the year totalled $201 million 2008: $nil, arising from the impairments of MF Global and Ore Hills DI portfolio.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets where it is probable that these amounts will be recovered.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the balances related to tax levied by the same taxation authority, and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The movement on the deferred tax account is as follows: 2009 2008 $m $m At 1 April 22 54 Currency translation differences 5 3 Income statement charge credit 19 5 Equity: Available-for-sale investments 2 8 Cash flow hedges 1 Share-based payments 14 11 Other revenue reserves 2 Transfers to discontinued operations 36 At 31 March 14 22 Comprised of: Deferred tax assets 5 52 Deferred tax liabilities 19 30 At 31 March 14 22 The asset $5 million and liability $19 million balances above have been presented net on the balance sheet on the grounds of materiality, giving a net deferred tax liability of $14 million 2008: net deferred tax asset of $22 million.
No provision has been made for withholding tax and UK corporation tax which may arise in the event of overseas subsidiaries and associates distributing their remaining reserves, where there is no current intention to remit these reserves to the UK.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax relating to losses is an asset of $12 million 2008: $13 million.
In addition, a deferred tax asset of $92 million $2008: $nil has not been recognised in respect of temporary differences, principally arising from the impairment of the Groups investment in Ore Hill, detailed in Note 2, as it is not considered probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

The disposal in the year ended 31 March 2008 was in relation to the restructuring of the Groups investment in BlueCrest, which resulted in the Groups holding reducing from 25% to 23%.
The Groups holding in BlueCrest increased back to 25% following the acquisition of additional equity in February 2009.
The investment in BlueCrest is carried at $217million 2008: $226 million.
The movement in the year relates to currency movements and the purchase of the additional equity shareholding in February 2009.
This is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the investment with its recoverable amount on an annual basis at the balance sheet date.
A value in use basis is used to calculate the recoverable amount by estimating the future cash flows for net management fee income only and discounting them at an appropriate risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The discount rate applied is 15% and net management fee income is assumed to grow at 10% per annum for five years, with no growth in perpetuity.
As a result of these calculations, no impairment was identified.
BlueCrest Capital Management has a statutory accounting reference date of 30 November.
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2009, this company has been included based on audited statutory accounts drawn up to 30 November 2008 and taking into consideration the management accounts in the subsequent period from 1 December 2008 to 31 March 2009.

Investments in associates and joint ventures continued On 8 May 2008, the Group acquired a 50% interest in Ore Hill, a major US-based credit specialist fund manager, for $272 million.
In February 2009, the Groups equity interest in Pemba increased back to 100%, through a deemed re-acquisition of its original 50% shareholding, at nil cost, with no further profit or loss arising.
The recoverable amount of the Ore Hill investment as at 31 March 2009 was considered to be the value-in-use, which was assessed using a discounted cash flow approach, based on a five year forecast by management factoring in modest sales, and expected outflows, fee margins, cost estimates and target fund performances of between 12% and 15% per annum.
Cash flows for future years were estimated using growth assumptions which are significantly below targeted performance in perpetuity, which management considered appropriate for the purposes of the impairment review exercise.
Pre-tax discount rates of 18% for management fees and 29% for performance fees, were used, reflecting current market conditions and the single-manager nature of the business.
As a result of this review at 31 March 2009 an impairment of $164 million was booked against the carrying value of the Ore Hill investment, which is in addition to a $50 million impairment booked in September 2008 see Note 2 c. Reducing assumed fund performance to 10% per annum would increase the impairment charge by $15 million.
On 6 June 2008 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd. for $40 million in cash, funded from the Groups existing resources.
The Group also paid $10 million for the option to buy the residual 75% of Nephila Capital Ltd. no earlier than 15 April 2010 at a fixed multiple of earnings.
Nephila is an alternative investment manager specialising in the management of funds which underwrite natural catastrophe reinsurance and investing in insurance-linked securities and weather derivatives.
The investments in Ore Hill and Nephila have been treated as joint venture investments as the Group has joint control through a contractual arrangement.
Additions relate to investments made in previously acquired joint ventures and associates and include $50 million of additional investment in BlueCrest, and $6 million of initial investment in Ore Hill.
Management have completed an exercise to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, the difference between these and the consideration represents goodwill.
The amounts are included in the overall carrying values as tested for impairment.

As detailed in the accounting policy note for associates and joint ventures, the Group has investments in certain fund entities over which it is able to exert significant influence but not control, which are classified as associates.
The Group has not provided summary financial information for these associates because the information would be of excessive length and is not considered meaningful for the user of the accounts.

Intangible assets Intangible assets include the following items: i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to equity prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
ii Sales commissions Sales commissions are paid to distributors and to employees.
In many instances, upfront sales commission is paid to distributors and to employees when a fund product is first launched, and is based on the amount of investors monies introduced.
This upfront commission is an incremental cost that is directly attributable to securing investors in fund products from which the Group earns income based on an investment management contract with the relevant fund.
Accordingly an intangible asset is recognised in accordance with IFRS, representing the Groups contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The carrying value of this intangible asset is based on the value of the initial upfront commission payments made to distributors and employees less an amortisation charge.
The amortisation period of upfront sales commissions is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which the Group is expected to earn economic benefit from the investor being invested in each fund product.
Management estimates that this period is five years in both the current and the comparative year.
All unamortised upfront sales commission is subject to impairment testing each period to ensure that the future economic benefit arising from each fund product is in excess of the remaining unamortised commission.
Where it is not, the unamortised portion is written down as a charge to the income statement.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets principally include computer software.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs include software development and associated employee costs.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives not exceeding three years.
For all intangible assets: The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income statement.
Amortisation of sales commissions is included in the sales commissions line in the income statement and amortisation of other intangibles is included in other expenses.
Impairment losses, if any, relating to sales commissions are included in sales commissions in the income statement and impairment losses, if any, relating to other intangibles are included in other expenses.

Other intangible assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs at the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
a Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units equivalent to each of the Groups acquisitions.
The carrying amounts are presented below: 2009 2008 $m $m Glenwood 76 76 RMF 621 621 Man Investment Nederland 1 Man Investments Australia 76 100 MTM Capital 16 774 813 Man Group plc 104 Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 15.
Intangible assets continued The most significant amount of goodwill relates to RMF.
This cash generating unit is also the one where there is most objective evidence that the goodwill may be impaired as RMFs funds under management FUM have declined from $28.7 billion at 31 March 2008 to $16.1 billion at 31 March 2009 and further significant redemptions are expected in the first half of the year ending 31 March 2010.
At the date of acquisition RMFs FUM was $8.7 billion.
The value in use of the RMF goodwill was assessed at the year-end by applying a discounted future cash flow model, which used as a basis the detailed budget for the financial year ending March 2010, which factored in expected sales, redemptions, fee margins, performance and cost estimates.
Cash flows for future years were generated assuming modest growth assumptions below those we would normally target, which management considered appropriate for the purposes of the impairment review exercise.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% was used for net performance fee income, higher than last year to reflect that current market conditions are more challenging than those assumed a year ago but also given that a reasonable amount of conservatism has already been built into the underlying cash flows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 20% was used for net performance fee income.
The result of the value in use calculation suggests that there is a small amount of headroom over the goodwill balance and therefore no impairment charge was considered appropriate.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the assumptions for this discounted cash flow analysis, with the following results: If the performance return was 5% in the financial year ending 31 March 2010, instead of the assumed 7% return, there would be a shortfall of discounted fee income over the goodwill balance of approximately $5 million: If redemptions were $500 million higher in the 2009 10 financial year, there would be a shortfall of discounted fee income over the goodwill balance of approximately $15 million: and If the discount rates were increased by 1% for net management fee income there would be a shortfall of discounted fee income over the goodwill balance of approximately $25 million.
The discounted future cash flows used to generate the value in use for Glenwood and Man Investments Australia are based on the budget for the financial year ending March 2010 and managements best estimates for future periods.
Pre-tax discount rates for net management fee income of 12% and 15% are applied to Glenwood and Man Investments Australia respectively.
The result of the value in use calculations suggests there is a significant amount of headroom over the respective goodwill balances.
b Intangible assets with finite useful lives No indications of impairment were evidenced during the year, other than the charge taken in the first half of the year relating to the accelerated amortisation of MGS sales commission see Note 2 a.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost, less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: Buildings life of the lease Equipment 310 years Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset or to the date of the next major renovation, whichever is sooner.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held through an ESOP trust are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Contracts entered into with a third party to buy back the Companys shares during a close period give rise to an obligation for the Group.
This obligation is included in trade and other payables and deducted from equity on the balance sheet for the value of the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the contract with the third party.
If the number of shares repurchased by the third party is not the maximum then there is a reversal through equity for that amount.
Any changes in the share price from the date of the contract are taken through the income statement.
All issued shares are fully paid.

During the year, the Company repurchased 30,546,992 2008: 45,860,019 ordinary shares at a total cost of $280 million 2008: $520 million.
These repurchased ordinary shares were treated as cancelled upon delivery to the Company.
During the year ended 31 March 2008, the remaining 247,860 of the Groups exchangeable bonds were converted into 116,366,171 ordinary shares.
In addition to the ordinary shares, as part of the return of cash to shareholders following the sale of the brokerage business, on 26 November 2007, the Company issued 916,298,711 B shares and 1,043,449,209 C shares out of equity.
The B shares were created by reducing the merger reserve by $722 million and share premium by $561 million.
The B shares are classified for accounting purposes as a liability instrument and are included in trade and other payables see Note 17.
The C shares were created out of share premium.
Of the issued B shares, 868,609,694 were cancelled upon payment of cash to shareholders and $1,216 million was transferred from revenue reserves to capital reserves to maintain the share capital.
During the year ended 31 March 2009 the remaining 47,689,017 B shares were cancelled on payment of cash to shareholders and $67 million was transferred from revenue reserves to capital reserves to maintain the share capital.
Subsequent to the payments to shareholders from the C shares, all the outstanding C shares were deferred and have no further rights, and are expected to be repurchased for 1 US cent and cancelled in December 2009.
Following shareholder approval at an EGM held on 23 November 2007 and the fulfilment of all conditions, each ordinary share of 3 US cents was consolidated on a seven for eight basis, effective on 26 November 2007.
Following this share consolidation, shareholders maintained the same percentage interest in the issued share capital as before and rights attaching to the ordinary shares remain unaffected.
On 29 July 2004, 50,000 unlisted deferred sterling shares with a par value of 1 per share were issued.
These shares are necessary to continue to comply with Section 118 of the Companies Act 1985, following the redenomination of the ordinary share capital into ordinary shares of 18 US cents each on that date.
The deferred sterling shares have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, no rights to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting and no right to participate in any distribution in a winding up except for a return of the nominal value of the shares after the return on the nominal amount paid up on every other class of share and the distribution of 100,000,000,000 to every other holder of every other class of share.
It is intended that these shares will always be held by a director of the Company.

Share capital and capital reserves continued The increase in the capital redemption reserve during the year arose from the transfer of $67 million from revenue reserves to capital reserves to maintain the share capital, following the cancellation of B shares and return to shareholders, as discussed in Note 19 above.
The merger reserve related to the acquisition of the RMF Investment Group in May 2002.
Revaluation reserves and retained earnings The available-for-sale reserve represents the unrealised change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments.
The cash flow hedge reserve represents the net gains on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when the hedge transaction affects profit or loss.
These reserves are not distributable.
The cumulative translation adjustment reserve comprises cumulative foreign exchange adjustments arising on the consolidation of subsidiaries with non-US dollar functional currencies.
These adjustments, which were set to zero as at the Groups transition date for IFRS 1 April 2004, will be recycled through the income statement on disposal of foreign currency subsidiaries.
The amount recycled to the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2009 was a debit of $3 million 2008: $11 million credit.

Financial Performance Man Group plc Annual Report 2009 111 24.
Acquisitions Year ended 31 March 2009 On 8 May 2008, the Group acquired a 50% interest in Ore Hill, a major US-based credit specialist fund manager.
Simultaneously, the Group sold a 50% holding in Pemba Credit Advisers, the European credit manager subsidiary of the Group, to Ore Hills principals to bring together the businesses of the two credit managers.
Nephila is an alternative investment manager specialising in underwriting natural catastrophe reinsurance and investing in insurancelinked securities and weather derivatives.
The assets and liabilities arising from the acquisitions in the period are as follows: Ore Hill Other Provisional Provisional Book value fair value Book value fair value $m $m $m $m Assets Cash and cash equivalents 6 6 3 3 Trade and other receivables 1 1 21 14 Management contracts 120 Other intangible assets 10 Property, plant and equipment 2 2 Total assets 9 139 24 17 Liabilities Trade and other payables 7 7 15 15 Total liabilities 7 7 15 15 Net assets 2 132 9 2 Net assets apportionment at 25% 1 Net assets apportionment at 50% 66 Share of net assets acquired 66 1 Goodwill on acquisition 206 41 Total net assets 272 42 $m $m Purchase consideration Cash paid 198 41 Shares in Pemba Credit Advisers 45 2,166,448 ordinary Man Group shares issued 24 Acquisition costs 5 1 Net consideration 272 42 Net consideration for Ore Hill and other acquisitions above 314 Less: Consideration paid in shares in Pemba Credit Advisers 45 Less: Consideration paid in Man Group shares 24 Total cash consideration 245 The fair value of the ordinary Man Group shares issued and to be issued is based on the share price as at the date of the transaction.
In the interim accounts as at 30 September 2008, net consideration for the acquisition of Ore Hill was stated at a provisional value of $288 million, including contingent consideration of 1,444,309 ordinary Man Group shares at a fair value of $16 million.
As at 31 March 2009, this contingent consideration is no longer considered payable, and net consideration and goodwill have been reduced accordingly.
The management contracts and other intangible assets of Ore Hill were independently valued by a third party using a value-in-use approach.
The key assumptions used included post-tax discount rates of 15% for management fees and 24% for incentive fees, and a useful economic life of management contracts of 1113 years.
The investments in Ore Hill and Nephila Capital Ltd have been treated as joint venture investments as the Group has joint control through contractual arrangements.
Year ended 31 March 2008 On 27 April 2007 the Group acquired 100% of MTM Corporate Finance Limited and 80% of MTM Capital Partners Limited, a fund management business, for $15 million.
The Group also acquired the option to buy the residual 20% of MTM Capital Partners Limited on the third anniversary of the transaction at fair market value.
On 13 March 2008 the Group acquired the remaining 50% shareholding in Man-Drake Capital Management Limited, a trading adviser, for $3 million.
This business is now in liquidation.

Disposals As part of the Ore Hill Pemba transaction set out in Note 24, on 8 May 2008 the Group sold a 50% holding in Pemba Credit Advisers, the European credit manager subsidiary of the Group, to Ore Hills principals.
In February 2009, the Group took back its 50% shareholding from the Ore Hill principals at nil cost, with no further profit or loss arising.
As a result of the above transactions, the Group did not control Pemba between 8 May 2008 and 27 February 2009.
The sale of 50% of shares in Pemba Credit Advisers at a value of $45 million in May 2008 led to the disposal of $5 million of cash held on the Groups balance sheet which related to Pemba Credit Advisers.
The profit of $48 million on the disposal of Pemba was based on net book value at the time of sale of $2 million and $5 million of foreign exchange differences previously taken to reserves.
Discontinued operations On 19 July 2007 the Group disposed of its brokerage business, renamed MF Global, through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.
Its results, up to the date of separation, are presented in these financial statements as a discontinued operation.
The IPO resulted in the disposal of 81.4% of the share capital of MF Global, giving rise to a gain on sale of $1.7 billion.
The residual shareholding held by the Group has been reclassified as an available-for-sale investment and carried at fair value, with fair value movements taken to the available-for-sale reserve within equity.
The fair value of the residual holding was $94 million at 31 March 2009 see Note 12.
The net proceeds of $2.7 billion received from the separation of MF Global were returned to shareholders through a B and C share scheme, undertaken on 26 November 2007.
In April 2009, MF Global claimed $30 million relating to certain financial adjustments arising from the MF Global IPO in July 2007.
At that time, Man Group and MF Global agreed a process for concluding a final and binding settlement of all financial adjustments relating to the IPO.
That process was concluded in March 2008 and, based on legal advice, we do not consider that Man Group has any further liability.
Man is committed to resolving any dispute in accordance with the arbitration mechanism agreed by both parties, and has therefore referred the matter to arbitration.
The post-tax result of the discontinued operation for the year ended 31 March 2008 was shown as a single amount on the face of the Group income statement.
In determining the post-tax result of the discontinued operation only those central costs eliminated on disposal were allocated to the discontinued operation.
The net assets of the brokerage business at the date of disposal were as follows: 18 July 2007 $m Property, plant and equipment 51 Intangible assets 317 Other non-current investments 317 Investments in associates 13 Trade and other receivables 46,755 Short-term investments 18,247 Cash and cash equivalents 1,429 Trade and other payables 65,818 Taxation 23 Short-term borrowings and overdrafts 56 Deferred taxation liabilities 7 Equity minority interests 23 Net assets 1,202 Financial Performance Man Group plc Annual Report 2009 113 25.

Earnings per share from discontinued operations comprise: 2008 Basic 94.9c Diluted 91.8c 26.
Contingent liabilities On 28 February 2008, MF Global announced that it had incurred a significant credit loss.
Following this disclosure a number of plaintiffs filed class action law suits in the US Federal Court against the Group, MF Global, certain of its officers and directors, and certain underwriters asserting various causes of action arising out of the US initial public offering.
The consolidated class action complaint alleges claims under certain sections of the US Securities Act of 1933 and alleges, among other things, that the public disclosure documents for the offering contained false and misleading statements concerning risk management and trading risk controls at MF Global.
The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, rescission and attorneys fees and expenses.
On 12 January 2009 the Group, along with all of the other defendants, filed Motions to Dismiss the consolidated complaint.
Briefing on the motions was completed on 13 April 2009.
No hearing date has been set.
The directors believe that the Group has substantial defences to the action and intend to defend the case vigorously.

In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account has not been presented for the Company.

Subsidiary undertakings The Companys shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less provision for any impairment incurred.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments Although the Company does not incur a charge, the issuance by the Company to its subsidiaries of an award over the Companys shares represents additional capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries.
An additional investment in subsidiaries results with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the awards issued spread over the underlying awards vesting periods.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements, and directly in equity, in the period in which the dividend is paid or approved by the Companys shareholders, if required.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that it can be recovered.
The Company does not discount its deferred tax position as the effect would not be material.
Segmental reporting The Company, being an investment holding company, only has one segment.
Share capital Contracts entered into with a third party to buy back the Companys shares during a close period gives rise to an obligation for the Company.
This obligation is included in other creditors and deducted from equity on the balance sheet for the value of the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the contract with the third party.
Any changes in the share price from the date of the contract are taken through the profit and loss account.
