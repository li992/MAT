Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th June 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Unquoted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board has taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Gains and losses on sales of investments and derivatives, exchange differences of a capital nature, performance fees charged to capital and other capital receipts and payments, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments and derivatives.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments and derivatives held at the year end are accounted for in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments and derivatives.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in the capital column.
UK dividends are included net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to the revenue column on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Stock lending income and interest receivable on deposits is taken to the revenue column on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the income statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and are treated as a capital item or an income item depending on the facts and circumstances of each dividend.
38 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: Performance related fees are allocated 100% to the capital column.
Expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sales proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and include items such as stamp duty and brokerage commissions.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 11 on page 44.
Subscription shares issue costs are charged to share premium.
e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Short term forward currency contracts are classified as derivative financial instruments and the net unrealised gain or loss is included in debtors or creditors respectively.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
h Taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.

This has arisen because deductible expenses have exceeded taxable income.
This asset may be utilised in future years where there is an excess of taxable income over deductible expenses.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust company, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares of overseas companies and a US Dollar liquidity fund which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
It is currently not the Companys policy to hedge against foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30th June are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2008: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US Dollar, South Korean Won, South African Rand, Indian Rupee, Taiwanese Dollar and other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least five occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.

Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.

Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Companys assets are clearly ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore, in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading, these assets would be protected.
