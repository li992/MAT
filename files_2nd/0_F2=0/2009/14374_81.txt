Retirement Healthcare The cost of providing healthcare benefits after retirement is determined by independent actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions in determining the cost of providing healthcare benefits are those in the UK andthe US andareas follows: 2009 2008 2007 UK US UK US UK US % per annum Discountrate 5.7 6.0 6.1 5.9 5.8 6.5 Medicalcostinflation 7.0 8.0 6.5 8.7 6.7 9.0 A one percentage point change in the rate of medical cost inflation would not affect the accumulated retirement benefit obligations, or the aggregate of the current service and interest costs, of the UK or US plans in2009bymorethan$2m $1m.
The assumed retirement healthcare cost trend for 2010 andthereafter isexpected tobe approximately 1.5% above the discountrate.
