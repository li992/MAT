Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 GENERAL INFORMATION FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is 395 King Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executives review on pages 7 to 25.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
The parent Company financial statements and notes thereto are shown separately under UK GAAP on pages 101 to 107.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and on a going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors Report on page 50.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2009 include the results of the rail businesses for the year to 31 March 2009, the results of the Greyhound businesses for the period from 1 April 2008 to 28 March 2009 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2009.
The Directors have revised the presentation of assets and liabilities and believe that it is appropriate to identify separately derivative financial instruments.
Comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Minority interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Minority interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation, and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
56 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows: Customer contracts over the life of the contract 9 to 20 years Greyhound brand and trade name over the life of the brand 20 years Franchise agreements over the term of the franchise 6 to 10 years Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger and freight services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and Transport Scotland.
Payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the train operating companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
Where season tickets are issued in excess of one weeks duration, the attributable share of income is deferred within creditors and is recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the season ticket.
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority.
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales.
Other Bus, including North America, and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations are recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 57 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuED 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and net foreign borrowings in foreign currencies see note 25 for details of the Groups policies in respect of foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising from the average or spot exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after amortisation charges, non-recurring bid costs and other non-recurring items but before investment income and finance costs.
Non-recurring items Non-recurring items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their size, nature and infrequency, require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.
58 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 59 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuED 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
60 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Groups UK Rail subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Sterling bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 61 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuED 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counter-party confirmations.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk on certain floating rate debt, and fair value hedges for fair value risk relating to the LIBOR element of a fixed rate financial liability.
The fuel swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of fuel price risks or otherwise used as economic hedges of such risks.
The cross currency swaps are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk relating to part of the Groups net investment in US Dollar assets.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made under IAS 37 for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
62 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOuNTING POLICIES continued New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with effective dates as noted below: Effective for accounting periods starting IAS IFRS standards on or after Amendments to IAS 39 Embedded Derivatives 1 July 2008 Amendments to IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments 1 January 2009 IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 1 January 2009 IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 July 2009 Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs 1 January 2009 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2009 Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 1 January 2009 Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 1 January 2009 Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate 1 January 2009 Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items 1 July 2009 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Assets 1 July 2008 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Assets Effective Date and Transition 1 July 2008 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 Effective for accounting periods starting Interpretations on or after Amendments to IFRIC 9 Embedded Derivatives 1 July 2008 IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 1 January 2009 IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 October 2008 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners 1 July 2009 IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 1 July 2009 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 1,820.0m 2008: 1,310.1m as set out in note 13 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 456.7m 2008: 367.5m as set out in note 14.
The sensitivities on the key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing are also set out in note 13.
Defined benefit pension arrangements Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of inflation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these are the discount rate and inflation assumptions.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 2m and 23m respectively.
A 0.1% movement in the inflation rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 3m and 16m respectively.
The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was 168.7m 2008: net surplus of 89.0m as set out in note 36.

IT costs comprise primarily the costs of systems integration.
Legal and professional costs comprise consultants and legal fees involved in planning and managing the integration.
Safety expenses include the costs of bringing the former Laidlaw businesses into line with FirstGroup standards and rebranding costs relate primarily to buses and signage.
Relocation of offices reflects the remaining lease costs of premises which were closed down during the integration process.
Fuel hedge ineffectiveness Fuel volumes for 2009 10 were hedged at fixed rates prior to the full impact of the economic downturn being known.
As a result of necessary mileage reductions across the business, particularly in UK Bus and Greyhound, the Groups fuel requirements for 2009 10 will be lower than the original volumes hedged.
Accordingly, this element of the fuel volume will not qualify for hedge accounting and a one-off charge of 23.1m has been provided based on our latest estimates of fuel usage for 2009 10.
This charge comprises UK Bus 7.4m, UK Rail 2.4m and Greyhound 13.3m.
uK Rail restructuring costs UK Rail non-recurring costs of 10.3m 2008: 16.8m were incurred during the year reflecting principally redundancy and associated costs in relation to the cost reduction action plan.
The 2008 non-recurring costs represented the one-off costs directly associated with the First Great Western remedial action plan.
North American restructuring costs The restructuring costs of 9.9m 2008: nil consist primarily of severance and relocation costs in relation to the cost reduction action plan.
uK Bus restructuring costs UK Bus restructuring costs of 2.1m 2008: nil were incurred during the year comprising principally redundancy and related costs of the cost reduction action plan.
European bid costs Bid costs of 3.5m 2008: 3.7m represent the non-recurring costs of bidding for contracts and potential acquisitions in Germany and other European countries.
Following the conclusion of our current European bidding activity we do not anticipate any further activity in the coming year.
uK Rail bid costs Bid costs of nil 2008: 3.5m were incurred during the year.
Last years bid costs were spent on our unsuccessful bid for the InterCity East Coast franchise.
Short term bank facility costs Short term bank facility costs of nil 2008: 4.5m were incurred during the year.
Last year a short term facility was taken out as part of the Laidlaw acquisition.
Due to the short term nature of this facility, the arrangement fee and other associated costs were treated as a non-recurring item.
Amortisation charges The charge for the year was 33.1m 2008: 18.9m with the increase mainly due to a full year charge for amortisation of contract and trade-name intangibles arising on the Laidlaw acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange movements.

Details of acquisitions in the year are shown in note 31.
During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cash-generating unit.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2009 10 and budget roll-forward for 2010 11 and then extrapolates cash flows for subsequent years based on estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2008: 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% 2008: 3.0% for North America.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% 2008: 10.0% was used in arriving at the value in use for each of the cash-generating units.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each cash-generating unit and to be realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.
The headroom by the principal cash-generating units and sensitivities thereon, which are shown on a mutually exclusive basis, are as follows: First First First UK Bus UK Rail Student Transit Services Greyhound m m m m m m 1 Carrying value 682.6 131.2 2,259.7 308.9 101.3 419.1 Headroom 1,003.7 284.4 529.6 158.9 31.9 392.5 Value in use 1,686.3 415.6 2,789.3 467.8 133.2 811.6 Headroom after increasing discount rate by 1.0% 931.8 259.2 410.8 139.3 26.3 357.5 Headroom after a 1.0% reduction in assumed growth rates 966.5 276.5 468.3 150.0 28.5 374.3 Headroom after a 1.0% reduction in margin 880.2 125.0 336.7 90.8 11.9 312.5 1 Net assets including goodwill below but excluding inter-company balances.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from failure by a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
Credit risk exists in relation to the Groups financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of 610.3m 2008: 590.2m, cash and cash equivalents of 322.5m 2008: 242.3m and derivative financial instruments of 27.9m 2008: 123.5m.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for all financial assets at the balance sheet date was 971.2m 2008: 959.8m.
The exposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty was 50.0m 2008: 60.8m at the balance sheet date.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 8.8m 2008: 5.0m.
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the UK Department for Transport, Network Rail, Transport for London, Transport Scotland, UK city councils and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America.
The Group does not consider any of these counterparties to be a significant risk.
Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury policy limits the maximum deposit amount with any one counterparty to 75 million or 50 million, depending on the counterparty, and limits the maximum term to three months.
The term of the bank deposits is typically less than one month.

Gains and losses transferred from equity into profit or loss during the period are included in the following line items on the face of the income statement.
2009 2008 m m Finance cost 26.8 2.8 Operating costs 65.0 2.4 38.2 0.4 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market based risks principally being the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The objective of the Groups liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient committed liquidity resources.
The Group has a diversified debt structure largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated and bilateral committed bank facilities and long term unsecured bond debt.
It is a policy requirement that refinancing obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 175m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates.
At 31 March 2009, the total amount of these facilities stood at 2,328.2m 2008: 2,394.6m, and committed headroom was 583.0m 2008: 587.2m.
Of these facilities, the earliest contractual expiry date is in February 2010 and relates to a $300m bank facility, which was undertaken to part finance the Laidlaw acquisition.
This debt was repaid on 9 April 2009.
The next material contractual expiry is in February 2012.
Largely due to the seasonality of the North American school bus business, headroom tends to reduce by September and increase again by March.
The average duration on net debt excluding ring-fenced cash at 31 March 2009 was 4.6 years 2008: 3.5 years.
This increased to 6.0 years on 9 April 2009.
The following table details the Groups expected maturity for its non derivative financial instruments.
The table has been prepared on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
The amounts in this table are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
Total amounts receivable per the table are 899.0m 2008: 553.5m.
For both 2009 and 2008 the table now includes the settlement of principal amounts at the end of the term of the cross currency swaps.
No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in either the year to 31 March 2009 or the year to 31 March 2008.
Currency risk Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in Sterling due to movements in exchange rates.
The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
Consequently the principal currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to Sterling.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 30% for US Dollar net assets and 75% for other currencies to be hedged.
As at 31 March 2009, 81% 2008: 84% of foreign currency denominated net assets were hedged with related foreign currency debt, debt and currency swaps.
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements.
US Dollar earnings arising in the US are substantially protected by US Dollar denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs and US Dollar interest costs so that exposure to EPS on a year to year basis is not material.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum average of 25% of such exposure to be hedged on a rolling 18 monthly basis.
Cash flow exposures are not material.
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange rates.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar.
The analysis has been prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.
In this case the impact on profit after tax relates only to fuel derivatives for the UK businesses.
2009 2008 m m Impact on profit after tax 11.6 0.1 Impact on hedging reserve 36.2 4.6 Interest rate risk The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore its net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Group treasury policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS.
The main floating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
The policy objective is achieved through fixed rate debt and cash flow hedge financial instruments, being interest rate swaps and collars.
The interest rate swaps cover periods from April 2008 to March 2012.
This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 3.2 years 2008: 2.7 years.
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
82 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25 DERIvATIvE FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS continued Fair value changes in the 250m Sterling bond relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps match the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bond.
Interest income is received in January and payments made in March and September each year.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point 1% increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant.
2009 2008 m m Impact on profit after taxation 1.4 0.5 Impact on hedging reserve 19.5 19.2 Interest rate hedges The following table details the notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly or semi-annual basis.
The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on a net basis.
Notional Fair value Average fixed rate principal amount asset liability 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m Less than one year 4.03 3.72 873 250 51.6 25.8 One to two years 4.33 4.03 1,047 625 31.1 20.0 Two to five years 5.26 500 5.8 8.7 More than five years 6.13 6.13 250 250 22.0 5.9 The interest rate swaps with a duration of more than five years are fair value hedges of the LIBOR element within the 250m bond.
All other swaps are cash flow hedges of variable rate interest.
Commodity price risk The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for potentially lower costs over the medium term.
The Group uses a range of cash flow hedge financial instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty.
During the year to 31 March 2009, the Group was hedged 100% on commodity price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2009 to March 2012 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31 March 2010.
The swaps give rise to monthly cashflow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.
Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs within operating results.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity on profit after tax and equity if the price of crude oil had been $10 per barrel higher at the year end.
2009 2008 m m Impact on profit after taxation 2.1 3.4 Impact on hedging reserve 39.5 22.1 The impact on profit after taxation in the above table for 2008 is a loss mainly because an element of the Laidlaw fuel consumption was not hedged.
Volume at risk for the year to 31 March 2010 is 4.6m 2008 09: 5.1m barrels for which 100% is hedged to diesel price risk.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 83 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuED 26 DEFERRED TAx The major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods are as follows: Other Accelerated tax temporary Tax depreciation differences losses Total m m m m At 1 April 2007 165.1 27.6 50.0 142.7 Charge credit to income 4.0 38.4 33.2 9.2 Charge to equity 25.1 25.1 1 Acquisition of subsidiaries restated 80.2 19.7 76.7 16.2 Foreign exchange movements 0.4 0.6 0.1 0.9 1 At 31 March 2008 restated 248.9 70.8 159.8 159.9 Charge credit to income 49.1 42.7 56.1 35.7 Credit to equity 237.6 237.6 Foreign exchange movements 61.7 5.6 54.9 12.4 At 31 March 2009 359.7 118.5 270.8 29.6 1 Restated for fair value adjustments as set out in note 31.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset and for financial reporting purposes.
2009 2008 m m Deferred tax assets 50.2 Deferred tax liabilities 20.6 159.9 29.6 159.9 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 325.0m 2008: 199.0m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 5m 2008: 70m of capital losses.
Insurance Legal 2 claims and other Pensions Total 27 PROvISIONS m m m m 1 At 1 April 2008 restated 208.1 54.4 5.9 268.4 Provided in the year 102.1 4.4 106.5 Utilised in the year 137.1 16.1 0.4 153.6 Notional interest 18.8 18.8 Foreign exchange movements 70.1 16.8 86.9 At 31 March 2009 262.0 59.5 5.5 327.0 1 Restated for fair value adjustments as set out in note 31.
2 Insurance claims accruals due within one year at 31 March 2009 amounted to 141.1m 2008: 108.6m and are included in accruals and deferred income within note 20.
The amount included within provisions above represents the estimate of amounts due after more than one year.
The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that the majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years.
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases filed or thought highly likely to be filed for incidents that occurred prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within ten years.
Also included are provisions in respect of costs anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
The pensions provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies.
It is anticipated that this will be utilised over 10 to 20 years.

Prior to the Laidlaw acquisition the authorised share capital was increased to 4,600m ordinary shares to enable the potential issue of shares to fund the acquisition.
Following the share placing described above the Directors considered it appropriate to reduce the authorised share capital.
Accordingly the authorised share capital was reduced from 4,600m ordinary shares to 650m ordinary shares on 10 July 2008 as approved at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed income.

92 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 35 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued The fair values of the options granted during 2008 09 and 2007 08 were measured using a Black-Scholes model.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.
Fair values for the SAYE include a 10% p. a. pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive, LTIP and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for pre-vesting forfeitures.
The Group used the inputs noted above to measure the fair value of the new share options.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2009 93 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuED 36 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 6.3m 2008: 3.5m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally defined benefit schemes under which benefits provided are based on employees number of years of service and either career average or final salary.
The scope of benefits varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups finances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
The various defined benefit schemes include six UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
First Greater Western Limited, First Capital Connect Limited, First ScotRail Limited, GB Rail and TransPennine Express have sections in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, which is an industry-wide arrangement.
Under the terms of the RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40%.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 74.0% and 122.4% 2008: 79.0% and 122.3%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2009 for all defined benefit schemes totalled 2,465m 2008: 2,911m.
Contributions are paid to all defined benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The valuations are made using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
