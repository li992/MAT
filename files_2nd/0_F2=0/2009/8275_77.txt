92 IHG Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates book value due to the short maturity of the investments and deposits.
Equity securities available-for-sale and derivatives are held in the Group statement of financial position at fair value as set out in note 15.
The fair value of other financial assets approximates book value based on prevailing market rates.
The fair value of borrowings, excluding finance lease obligations and the fixed rate 250m 6% bonds, approximates book value as interest rates reset to market rates on a frequent basis.
The fair value of the 250m 6% bonds is based on the quoted market price.
The fair value of the finance lease obligation is calculated by discounting future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and current provisions approximates to their carrying value, including the future redemption liability of the Groups loyalty programme.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
2009 2008 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Assets Equity securities available-for-sale 2 69 71 2 68 70 2009 2008 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Liabilities Derivatives 20 20 10 10 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the year and no transfers into and out of Level 3.
The following table reconciles movements in instruments classified as Level 3 during the year: 2009 $m Balance at 1 January 2009 68 Valuation gains recognised in other comprehensive income 11 Impairment 10 Balance at 31 December 2009 69 The impairment charge recognised in the income statement see note 5 also includes $4m of losses reclassified from equity.
The Level 3 equity securities relate to investments in unlisted shares which are valued by applying an average price-earnings P E ratio for a competitor group to the earnings generated by the investment.
A 10% increase in the average P E ratio would result in a $5m increase in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in the average P E ratio would result in a $5m decrease in the fair value of the investments.
Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
