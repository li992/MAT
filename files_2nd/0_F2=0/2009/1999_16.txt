A summary of the more important Company accounting policies is set out below.
There is no material difference between the pro t on ordinary activities before taxation and the retained pro t for the year and their historical cost equivalents.
The principal activity of the Company is to act as a holding company.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 Cash Flow Statements Revised 1996, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash ow statement on the grounds that its consolidated financial statements, which include the Company, are publicly available.
Adoption of new Accounting Standards and pronouncements No new Accounting Standards or Amendments to Accounting Standards under Financial Reporting Standards are applicable to the Company during the year.

Its adoption is not expected to have a signi cant impact on the financial statements.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Investments The parent Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Share-based payments The Company operates two equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the pro t and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
