Return on invested capital ROIC ROIC is a performance indicator used by management and defined as operating profit after tax before exceptional items as a percentage of invested capital.
Invested capital is defined as non-current assets plus current assets less current liabilities, excluding all balances relating to interest bearing liabilities and all other assets or liabilities associated with the financing and capital structure of the group and excluding any deferred tax balances and effective hedges relating to interest-bearing liabilities.
