At 1 February 2009, there was a credit balance of 0.5m including uncleared banking items 2008: 0.4m.
The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of Sterling and Euro Bonds, amounting to 784m 2008: 758m in respect of a subsidiary undertaking.
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
co. uk annualreport09 89 46 Contingent liabilities continued In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading OFT issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers, alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003.
Morrisons was accused in relation to one infringement in 2002, and has vigorously denied this.
Based on the evidence put forward, the Board does not consider it probable that the Company will ultimately incur a fine and, accordingly, has made no provision for any such liability.
The OFT have also raised a legal issue regarding the sale of tobacco and whether established industry practices represented a breach of competition law.
It is likely that this can only be settled through a formal judicial process.
The Board has not made a provision for such a liability.
47 Post-balance sheet events The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 1 February 2009 of 5.0p per share which will absorb an estimated 131m of shareholders funds.
Subject to approval at the AGM, it will be paid on 10 June 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 8 May 2009.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend.
The Company has entered into further commodity price contracts since the year end to reduce the Companys exposure to pricing risk arising on the volatility of commodity prices purchased for the Companys own consumption.
