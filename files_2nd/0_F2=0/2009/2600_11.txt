The revenue presented relates to external customers.
Sales between the business areas are not material.
Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the foodservice, grocery, cleaning & safety, non-food retail and healthcare markets.
The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to operating profit before intangible amortisation and this measure also represents the segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance with IFRS 8.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas.
There are no customers who account for more than 10% of Group revenue.
Customer dependencies are regularly monitored.
