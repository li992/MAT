52 | 53 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of Marstons PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts from the date on which control transferred to the Group or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration paid and deferred, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consolidated financial statements also incorporate the results of Marstons Issuer PLC, a company set up with the sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group.
The Directors of Marstons PLC consider this company meets the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 Consolidation special purpose entities and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary undertaking.
Details of this company are provided in note 33.
Revenue and other operating income Revenue represents the value of goods drink and food and services accommodation and gaming machines supplied to customers, and rents receivable from licensed properties.
Revenue for drink, food and accommodation is recognised at the point at which the goods or services are provided.
Gaming machine income is recognised as earned.
Rental income is recognised in respect of the period to which it relates.
Revenue is recorded net of discounts, intra-Group transactions, VAT, and excise duty relating to the brewing and packaging of certain products.
Other operating income comprises mainly rents receivable from unlicensed properties, which is recognised in respect of the period to which it relates.
Segmental reporting For primary segment reporting purposes the Group is considered to have four distinguishable business segments, being Marstons Inns and Taverns, Marstons Pub Company, Marstons Beer Company and Marstons Group Services.
This mirrors the Groups internal organisation and management structure, and reflects the different risk profiles to which the business is exposed.
An element of Marstons Group Services costs is allocated to each of the trading divisions.
Acquired businesses are treated as separate reporting segments, where material, until they have been fully integrated with the Groups trading divisions.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value of these assets can be identified separately and measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.
Where the useful life of the asset is considered to be indefinite no annual amortisation is provided but the asset is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Impairment reviews are carried out more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired.
co. uk Stock Exchange Code: MARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP ACCOUNTS GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE DIRECTION NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2009 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are: Acquired brands Indefinite Lease premiums Life of the lease Computer software 5 to 10 years Any impairment of carrying value is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets or liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated at business segment level.
Property, plant and equipment Q Freehold and leasehold properties are initially stated at cost and subsequently at valuation.
Plant and machinery is stated at cost.
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are stated at valuation or at cost.
Q Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less residual value over their useful lives.
Q Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years.
Q Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Q Other plant and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Q Own labour and interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Valuation of properties Properties are revalued by qualified valuers on a regular basis using open market value so that the carrying value of an asset does not differ significantly from its fair value at the balance sheet date.
When a valuation is below current carrying value, the asset concerned is reviewed for impairment.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the income statement.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case they are recorded in the income statement.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment represents net sale proceeds less the carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the property disposed of is transferred to retained earnings at the date of sale.
Impairment If there are indications of impairment or reversal of impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair market value less costs to sell.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement.
The depreciation or amortisation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
There is no reversal of impairment losses relating to goodwill.
Acquired brands are reviewed for impairment on a portfolio basis.
MARSTONS PLC Annual Report 2009 54 | 55 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Leases Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The cost of the assets held under finance leases is included within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is charged in accordance with the accounting policy for each class of asset concerned.
The corresponding capital obligations under these leases are shown as liabilities.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement and classified within finance costs as incurred.
Rental costs under operating leases, including lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Similarly, income receivable under operating leases is credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Other non-current assets Other non-current assets represent trade loans.
In common with other major brewers the Group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the Groups beer.
These trade loans are classified as loans and receivables and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Significant trade loans are secured against the property of the loan recipient.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued on a first in, first out basis, with the exception of hops which are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress include direct materials, labour and a proportion of attributable overheads.
Assets held for sale Assets, typically properties, are categorised as held for sale when the value of the asset will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is being actively marketed.
In addition, the Group must be committed to the sale and the completion should be expected to occur within one year from the date of classification.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits on call with banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of the Groups financial instruments at initial recognition.
a Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives are categorised as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges.
The Group holds no other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, trade loans and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
co. uk Stock Exchange Code: MARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP ACCOUNTS GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE DIRECTION NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2009 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the income statement within exceptional finance costs or income in the period in which they arise.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Preference shares are classified as liabilities.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects which, under the allowed alternative treatment, are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
MARSTONS PLC Annual Report 2009 56 | 57 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and estimated future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within other operating charges.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other operating charges in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Employee benefits Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are determined by the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried out at each period end date.
Costs are recognised separately as operating and finance costs in the income statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, any income or expenses on settlements or curtailments, and past service costs where the benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the interest on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising differences between the actual and expected return on scheme assets, changes in scheme liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet for the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of scheme liabilities less the fair value of scheme assets.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Post-retirement medical benefits are accounted for in an identical way to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
Key management personnel are those who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
In the case of Marstons PLC the only key management personnel are considered to be the Directors of the Group.
Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Differences are defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
co. uk Stock Exchange Code: MARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP ACCOUNTS GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE DIRECTION NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2009 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled, on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a deficit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as provisions.
These provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Share-based payments The fair value of share-based remuneration at the date of grant is calculated using the BlackScholes option-pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions contained within IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and has only applied this accounting policy to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002.
Awards granted prior to 7 November 2002 are not charged to the income statement.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares, shares held within a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and shares held within an Executive Share Option Plan ESOP, which is used for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to equity.
No income or expense is recognised in the performance statements on treasury share transactions.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Transactions and balance sheet items in a foreign currency Transactions in a foreign currency are translated to sterling using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary receivables and payables are remeasured at closing day rates at each balance sheet date.
Exchange gains or losses that arise from such remeasurement and on settlement of the transaction are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences for non-monetary assets valued at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Gains or losses on disposal of nonmonetary assets are recognised in the income statement.
Key assumptions and significant judgements IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups key assumptions and significant judgements are in respect of property, plant and equipment, impairment, pension liabilities, taxation, financial instruments and share-based payments.
Details of these assumptions and judgements are set out in the relevant accounting policy and detailed note to the financial statements.

The first review predominantly focused on tenanted pubs let on nonsubstantive agreements and the second review predominantly focused on leasehold town centre pubs.
These categories of pubs are considered to be those most affected by the weakened UK economy.
The total impairment identified was 68.0 million, which has been taken either to the income statement as an exceptional item or, where the impairment reverses a previous upwards valuation, to the revaluation reserve.
The impact of the impairments described above is as follows: 2009 m Income statement: Impairment of other intangible assets note 11 0.2 Impairment of property, plant and equipment note 12 19.7 Impairment of assets held for sale note 15 4.2 24.1 Revaluation reserve: Reversal of past revaluation surplus property, plant and equipment note 12 43.2 Reversal of past revaluation surplus assets held for sale note 15 0.7 43.9 Total impairment 68.0 The total impairment analysed by business segment is as follows: 2009 m Marstons Inns and Taverns 32.6 Marstons Pub Company 35.1 Marstons Group Services 0.3 68.0 MARSTONS PLC Annual Report 2009 62 | 63 4 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED In determining whether there is a trigger for impairment, the Group considers the performance of groups of pubs with similar risk profiles and characteristics.
Where these are identified the impairment calculations are performed at an individual pub level.
The Group has estimated the above impairments on the basis of fair market value less costs to sell.
Pubs which are being marketed for sale have been transferred to assets held for sale note 15 as appropriate.
The key assumptions in determining the level of impairment are the estimated market value based on specialist advice and the time frame within which those pubs can be sold.
A 1% increase decrease in the market value assumption used would decrease increase the impairment by 1.3 million.
This increase decrease would impact both the income statement and the revaluation reserve.
The further impact of discounting sale proceeds if there were a delay in the expected time frame by 6 to 12 months is insignificant.
Recognition of onerous lease and other property related provisions As part of the overall review of properties, a full assessment of property provisions was undertaken to reflect the most recent circumstances and expectations.
A number of onerous lease and other property related provisions were identified during the review and these have been recognised in provisions for other liabilities and charges note 24.
These are considered to be linked to the exceptional events which have impacted the estate as noted above.
Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date and the movement is recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting is applied.
The movement of 11.9 million 2008: 4.2 million in the fair value of swaps, where hedge accounting has not been applied, is shown as an exceptional item.
Impact of taxation The current tax credit relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 0.2 million 2008: 1.4 million.
The deferred tax credit relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 9.5 million 2008: 1.2 million.
In the prior period 1.4 million was charged as an exceptional item in relation to the phasing out of industrial buildings allowances.
Prior period exceptional items A reorganisation and redundancy programme was undertaken during the prior period.
Following the Pre-Budget Report on 24 November 2008, it was considered appropriate to write off all fees incurred to date in respect of a potential conversion of the Group to Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status.

9 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares and those held in the Executive Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Underlying earnings per share figures are presented to exclude the effect of exceptional items.

Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 115.2 million 2008: 115.2 million to Marstons Inns and Taverns, 85.4 million 2008: 85.4 million to Marstons Pub Company and 23.6 million 2008: 23.3 million to Marstons Beer Company.
Goodwill has been allocated to business segments based on the extent to which the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The key assumptions used are the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of 9.0% 2008: 9.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets of 2.0% 2008: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term growth rate, which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the Groups trading divisions.
Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had substantial levels of headroom and as such no impairment of goodwill was required in the current or prior period.

co. uk Stock Exchange Code: MARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP ACCOUNTS GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE DIRECTION NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2009 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss were designated as such on initial recognition.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market, such as over-the-counter derivatives, is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and trade loans, and the carrying value of trade payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated, taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower during the period ended 3 October 2009, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been 0.7 million 2008: 0.9 million lower higher as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate payable on the floating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 19.
These derivative financial instruments have qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recognised in equity for the effective portion of the hedge.
The losses taken directly to equity in the period totalled 39.3 million 2008: 38.3 million.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 3 October 2009 totalled 510.4 million 2008: 528.6 million.
The interest rate swaps fix interest at 4.9% and 5.5%.
MARSTONS PLC Annual Report 2009 76 | 77 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED On 1 October 2007, the Group entered into two interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These derivative financial instruments have not qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement.
The losses taken to the income statement in the period totalled 11.9 million 2008: 4.2 million note 4.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 3 October 2009 totalled 140.0 million 2008: 140.0 million.
The interest rate swaps fix interest at 5.5% and 5.6%.
On 20 May 2009, the Group entered into a further interest rate swap of 20.0 million to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
This derivative financial instrument has qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recognised in equity for the effective portion of the hedge.
The losses taken directly to equity in the period totalled 0.1 million.
The notional principal amount of this interest rate swap contract at 3 October 2009 totalled 20.0 million.
The interest rate swap fixes interest at 1.1%.
This interest rate swap contract terminates on 8 August 2010.
On the same day, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap of 20.0 million to continue to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
The gains taken directly to equity in the period totalled 0.1 million.
The notional principal amount of this interest rate swap contract at 3 October 2009 was 20.0 million.
The interest rate swap fixes interest at 3.3%.
This interest rate swap commences on 9 August 2010 and terminates on 8 August 2013.
The interest rate risk profile, after taking account of derivative financial instruments, is as follows: 2009 2008 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed rate rate rate rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 5.4 1,204.5 1,209.9 107.7 1,237.7 1,345.4 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial borrowings was 5.5% 2008: 5.4% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed was eight years 2008: nine years.
Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be significant.
Market risk: The Groups market risk is explained in detail in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 31 to 36.
Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by the use of three UK banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no significant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range of institutions.

Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits are regularly monitored.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables and free trade loans has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits and fixtures and fittings.
Receivables are written off against the provision for impairment when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of its customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.
Liquidity risk: Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements, and maintaining debt financing plans.
The Groups borrowing covenants are subject to regular review.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and non-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
