Exceptional items Impairment of inventories During the half year ended 31 December 2008, in light of deteriorations in market conditions upon certain commercial and housebuilding sites that the Group had specifically targeted for sale and realised in the period, a net realisable value write-down of 62.6m was recognised against the land and work in progress value.
In addition, the Group also conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying-values of its sites during the period in light of the continued deterioration in the UK housing market.
Where the estimated net realisable value of the site was less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in progress value.
This resulted in an impairment of 432.3m.
The total impairment of inventories recognised as an exceptional cost during the half year ended 31 December 2008 was 494.9m.
During the half year ended 30 June 2009, the Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying-values of its sites.
This resulted in a further impairment of inventories for the year which was recognised as an exceptional cost of nil for the housebuilding business although there were gross impairment reversals and charges of 120.9m due to performance variations upon housebuilding sites and 4.6m for the commercial developments business.
The total impairment of inventories recognised as an exceptional cost during the year ended 30 June 2009 was 499.5m 2008: 208.4m.
Further details on this impairment are given in note 18.
Impairment of goodwill At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted an impairment review of its goodwill as explained in note 11.
This resulted in no impairment charge for the year 2008: 24.5m.
Impairment of intangible assets At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted an impairment review of its brands as explained in note 12.
This resulted in no impairment charge for the year 2008: 6.2m.
Restructuring costs During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group incurred 27.1m 2008: 15.9m of costs in relation to reorganising and restructuring the business, including redundancy costs of 17.6m 2008: 3.7m.

Exceptional items continued Pension curtailment gain During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group recognised curtailment gains of 7.1m 2008: nil in respect of the cessation of future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current employees and the associated removal of the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases and redundancies made during the year.
Further details are given in note 27.
Make-whole fee on redemption of private placement notes During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group incurred charges of 13.3m 2008: nil in respect of the make-whole fee which was triggered on the redemption of 36.7m of private placement notes.
Further details are given in note 24.
Impairment of inventories relating to investments accounted for using the equity method At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted an impairment review of its share of the inventories included within its investments accounted for using the equity method.
This resulted in an impairment charge for the year of 2.8m with a related deferred tax credit of 0.8m.

Factors affecting the tax credit charge for the year The tax rate assessed for the year is higher 2008: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the period of 28.0% 2008: 29.5%.
The differences are explained below: 2009 2008 m m Loss profit before tax 678.9 137.3 Loss profit before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 28.0% 2008: 29.5% 190.1 40.5 Effects of: Goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes 7.2 Other expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.1 7.1 Additional tax relief for land remediation costs 2.7 1.9 Adjustment in respect of previous years 18.7 2.8 Tax in respect of joint ventures 0.8 0.8 Tax rate difference on losses carried back 2.2 Tax on share-based payments 0.5 Tax credit charge for the year 210.3 50.9 Legislation on the taxation of foreign profits received Royal Assent on 21 July 2009.
These rules include provisions to restrict interest deduction on intra-group loans, which will apply to accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2010.
Where interest deductions are restricted under these new rules in one Group company, the legislation includes the scope to claim an adjustment in the corresponding company and the flexibility to allocate the interest deductions across the Group in order to prevent losses becoming trapped.
As a result it is not envisaged that these rules will impact on the Groups future tax charge.

Loss earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 468.6m 2008: 86.4m profit by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled, which were 345.0m 2008: 345.0m.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 468.6m 2008: 86.4m profit by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the year, giving a figure of 345.0m 2008: 346.7m.

The goodwill of the commercial developments business was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts its annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2009 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying-value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment.
The first three years of cash flows were determined using the Groups approved detailed site-by-site business plan.
The cash flows for the fourth and fifth years were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, considering available land purchases and work in progress levels.
The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were: Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Groups housebuilding business.
Accordingly the rate of 8.9% is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate being the Groups estimated long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
This rate is calculated using the current capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date.
74 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 11.
Goodwill continued Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions and product type.
For years four and five these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions.
Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development including any additional costs that are expected to occur due to the business being on an individual development site for longer due to current market conditions.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups goodwill was not impaired.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 June 2009 was based upon current expectations regarding sales volumes, expected changes in selling prices and site costs to complete in the difficult conditions within the UK housing market and used a discount rate appropriate to the position and risks of the Group.
The result of the impairment review, which was based upon the capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date, was that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying-value by 2,932.7m.
As explained in note 36 there is a proposed change to the Groups capital structure which may impact the Groups discount rates for future periods.
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate further reducing operating margins by 7.8% per annum or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 4.7% and all other variables were held constant then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying-value.

The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
At 30 June 2009 an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 11.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m prior to amortisation was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets.
Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

Deferred tax continued It is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of the brands will reverse in the twelve months following the balance sheet date.
Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the twelve months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to quantify the value of these reversals.
In addition to the above, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset of 2.9m 2008: 1.8m in respect of capital and other losses that are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.
The movements in each type of temporary difference for the Company are as follows: Pension Share Hedging Other Total scheme options restated restated Company m m m m m At 1 July 2007 as previously reported 21.9 3.0 2.6 21.5 Prior year adjustment 3.8 3.8 At 1 July 2007 as restated 18.1 3.0 2.6 17.7 Income statement 2.1 2.2 4.3 Amounts taken directly to equity 5.6 4.3 0.4 0.9 At 30 June 2008 10.4 1.3 0.8 12.5 Income statement 5.6 0.1 5.5 Amounts taken directly to equity 4.0 23.6 27.6 At 30 June 2009 8.8 0.1 24.9 0.8 34.6 The results for the year ended 30 June 2008 have been restated as explained in the Accounting policies note.
Inventories Group 2009 2008 m m Land held for development 2,453.2 3,117.5 Construction work in progress 1,044.2 1,569.3 Part-exchange properties 36.7 137.9 Other inventories 6.7 5.3 3,540.8 4,830.0 a Nature of inventories The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within twelve months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
b Impairment of inventories At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a net realisable value review of its land and work in progress which resulted in an impairment of 208.4m.
During the half year ended 31 December 2008, the Group provided 62.6m for a reduction in net realisable value upon certain commercial and housebuilding sites that it had specifically targeted for sale and realised.
The Group also conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during the period.
This review compared the estimated net realisable value of each of the Groups development sites with its balance sheet carrying-value and where the estimated net realisable value of an individual site was less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in progress value of the site.
The result of this further site-by-site net realisable value review was an exceptional impairment of 432.3m.

Inventories continued b Impairment of inventories continued The total impairment of land and work in progress recognised during the half year ended 31 December 2008 was 494.9m.
A further impairment review was conducted during the half year ended 30 June 2009.
This also compared the estimated net realisable value of each of the Groups development sites with its balance sheet carrying-value and where the estimated net realisable value of an individual site was less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in progress value of the site.
The result of this further site-by-site net realisable value review was a net exceptional impairment of nil for the housebuilding business, although there were gross impairment reversals and charges of 120.9m due to performance variations upon housebuilding sites, and 4.6m for the commercial developments business.
The total impairment of land and work in progress recognised during the year ended 30 June 2009 was 499.5m included in exceptional items note 3.
The key judgement in estimating the net realisable value of a site was the estimation of likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete.
Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and considered the current prices being achieved upon each site for each product type.
Although the impairment of land and work in progress was based upon the current prices being achieved by the Group in the difficult conditions within the UK housing market, if the UK housing market were to deteriorate or improve beyond management expectations in the future then further adjustments to the carrying-value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments 1,460.5m 2008: 557.0m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c Expensed inventories The value of inventories expensed in 2009 and included in cost of sales was 2,009.8m 2008: 2,714.2m including 0.1m 2008: 10.4m of inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of nil 2008: 5.4m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period, but excluding the 499.5m 2008: 208.4m exceptional impairment.
The reversal of 5.4m in the prior year arose mainly due to obtaining planning approval on strategic land and other interests that had previously been written down to net realisable value.
During the second half, average selling prices across the Groups developments were in line with those incorporated into the impairment review at 31 December 2008 and therefore overall no further impairment was required in the housebuilding business, although there were gross impairment reversals and charges of 120.9m due to performance variations upon housebuilding sites.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2009 totalled 499.6m 2008: 218.8m, being the 499.5m 2008: 208.4m classified as an exceptional cost and the remaining 0.1m 2008: 10.4m incurred in the normal course of trading.
d Company The Company has no inventories.

The impairment recognised in cost of sales represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

Derivative financial instruments swaps continued a Interest rate swaps The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to interest rates, arising from the Groups and Companys sources of finance.
All of the Groups and Companys interest rate swap arrangements contain a clause that allows the Group Company or the issuer to cancel the swap in May 2012 at fair value.
As at 30 June 2009 the Group and Company had outstanding floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts of 1,209.4m 2008: 1,409.2m.
In obtaining this funding the Group and Company sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap 765.0m 2008: 765.0m of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 26.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2009, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of 87.8m 2008: 6.8m with a loss of 81.0m 2008: 19.1m charged directly to equity in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Swaps with a notional amount of 95.0m were cancelled during the prior year on the refinancing of part of the Groups and Companys Sterling borrowings.
Cumulative losses on these swaps of 3.6m were deferred in equity in the prior year as the forecast transaction specified in the hedge relationship is still expected to occur.
These losses will be recognised in the income statement over the period the forecast transaction occurs: 0.4m 2008: 0.1m of the loss was recognised in the income statement in the year, and a balance of 3.1m 2008: 3.5m remains deferred in equity.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 26. b Basis rate swaps During the year, the Group entered into 400.0m of six-month basis rate swaps to swap the interest payable upon some of the Groups borrowings from six-month LIBOR to one-month LIBOR plus a premium.
These swaps reduced the cash interest payable by the Group by 1.4m over the six-month life.
There were no basis rate swaps outstanding as at 30 June 2009. c Foreign exchange swaps The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange arising from the Groups sources of finance denominated in US Dollars.
As at 30 June 2009 the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $271.6m 2008: $300.0m.
On 12 January 2009, as part of the US Dollar private placement notes repayment and issue of notes due to the make-whole agreement, the Company cancelled $40.5m of the foreign exchange swaps and entered into $12.1m of US Dollar denominated foreign exchange swaps.

Derivative financial instruments swaps continued c Foreign exchange swaps continued The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group treasury policy outlined in note 26.
After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows: Fixed Amount rate payable $m % Maturity 1.0 10.95 2013 30.3 8.98 2013 7.5 10.55 2017 173.0 6.61 2017 3.6 12.23 2018 56.2 9.24 2018 271.6 The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements.
The hedges match the contractual initial receipt, the final settlement, and as a result of refinancing on 9 July 2008 match 73% of the interest payments.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2009, which is based on third party valuations, was an asset of 30.5m 2008: 7.4m with a gain of 30.3m 2008: 7.4m credited directly to equity in the year.
7.2m 2008: nil of this gain was realised upon cancellation of $40.5m of foreign exchange swaps following repayment of $40.5m US Dollar private placement notes on 12 January 2009.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 26.
Financial risk management The Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 23, 24 and 25.
The Groups operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management with the goal of ensuring that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department.
These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board.
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May, and October and November, of each year, due to seasonal trends in income.
Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient headroom under its revolving credit facilities to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of 250.0m of available committed bank facilities and identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations.
This represented 65.0% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2009 2008: 65.9%.
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2009.
At the date of approval of the financial statements the Groups internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements.
Compliance with covenants is also considered on pages 58 and 59.

Financial risk management continued a Liquidity risk continued The Groups objective is to minimise refinancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years.
At 30 June 2009, the average maturity of the Groups committed bank facilities was 3.1 years 2008: 3.3 years.
The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations.
The undrawn committed facilities available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows: Group Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 Expiry date m m m m In less than one year 50.0 50.0 In more than one year but not more than two years 190.0 190.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 750.0 680.0 750.0 680.0 800.0 870.0 800.0 870.0 In addition, the Group had 68.8m of undrawn uncommitted facilities available at 30 June 2009 2008: 88.7m.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities, excluding derivative financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity at the balance sheet date were as follows: Carrying Contractual Less than 1 1-2 2-5 Over 5 amount cash flows year years years years Group Note m m m m m m 30 June 2009 Loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts 24 1,484.1 1,864.6 83.8 93.3 1,370.0 317.5 Trade and other payables 24 885.7 936.0 650.3 157.5 115.9 12.3 2,369.8 2,800.6 734.1 250.8 1,485.9 329.8 30 June 2008 Loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts 24 1,685.2 2,099.3 758.9 280.8 725.3 334.3 Trade and other payables 24 1,155.9 1,204.6 922.2 144.3 119.6 18.5 2,841.1 3,303.9 1,681.1 425.1 844.9 352.8 The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Companys financial liabilities, excluding derivative financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity at the balance sheet date were as follows: Carrying Contractual Less than 1 1-2 2-5 Over 5 amount cash flows year years years years Company Note m m m m m m 30 June 2009 Loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts 24 1,587.4 1,967.9 187.1 93.3 1,370.0 317.5 Trade and other payables 24 33.2 33.2 33.2 1,620.6 2,001.1 220.3 93.3 1,370.0 317.5 30 June 2008 Loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts 24 1,736.3 2,150.4 810.0 280.8 725.3 334.3 Trade and other payables 24 32.0 32.0 32.0 1,768.3 2,182.4 842.0 280.8 725.3 334.3 Trade and other payables excludes deferred income, payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on contracts, tax and social security and other non-financial liabilities.

b Market risk price risk i UK housing market risk This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks which include: A weekly review is undertaken of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash flow projections.
The Group seeks to provide mortgage providers with complete transparency regarding house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision.
The Group works with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for its customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and brands.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued i UK housing market risk continued The Groups financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows: Linked to UK Not linked to UK housing market housing market Total Group m m m 30 June 2009 Non-derivative financial assets 86.5 195.3 281.8 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,369.8 2,369.8 Derivatives 57.3 57.3 86.5 2,231.8 2,145.3 30 June 2008 Non-derivative financial assets 66.9 84.6 151.5 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,841.1 2,841.1 Derivatives 0.6 0.6 66.9 2,755.9 2,689.0 The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2009 these were carried at a fair value of 86.5m 2008: 66.9m.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2009, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 6.2m 2008: 14.9m with a corresponding reduction in both net profit and equity.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements.
The Group has a policy that 60%80% of the Groups median gross borrowings calculated on the latest three-year plan taking into account hedging is at a fixed rate, with an average minimum duration of five years and an average maximum duration of fifteen years.
At 30 June 2009, 68.4% of the Groups borrowings was at a fixed rate 2008: 61.6%.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Floating Fixed Non-interest rate rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Group m m m m 30 June 2009 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,209.4 274.7 885.7 2,369.8 Impact of interest rate swaps 765.0 765.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 444.4 1,039.7 885.7 2,369.8 30 June 2008 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,409.2 276.0 1,155.9 2,841.1 Impact of interest rate swaps 765.0 765.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 644.2 1,041.0 1,155.9 2,841.1 92 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 26.
Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued ii Interest rate risk continued The exposure of the Companys financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Floating Fixed Non-interest rate rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Company m m m m 30 June 2009 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,312.7 274.7 33.2 1,620.6 Impact of interest rate swaps 765.0 765.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 547.7 1,039.7 33.2 1,620.6 30 June 2008 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,460.3 276.0 32.0 1,768.3 Impact of interest rate swaps 765.0 765.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 695.3 1,041.0 32.0 1,768.3 Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2009 was 6.6% 2008: 6.6%.
Sterling private placement notes of 114.2m 2008: 125.5m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2009 was 11.5% 2008: 7.8% with, at 30 June 2009, a weighted average period of 8.5 years 2008: 9.5 years for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of 164.9m 2008: 150.5m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2009 was 11.0% 2008: 6.9% with, at 30 June 2009, a weighted average period of 7.8 years 2008: 8.8 years for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2009, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax loss profit would increase decrease by 3.9m 2008: 4.8m, the Groups post-tax loss profit would increase decrease by 2.8m 2008: 3.4m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 2.8m 2008: 3.4m.
iii Foreign exchange rate risk As at 30 June 2009, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $271.6m 2008: $300.0m.
In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and a significant proportion of the interest payments.
The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges.
Accordingly the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on the principal of its US Dollar debt.
As a result of the revised financing arrangements implemented in July and August 2008, the foreign exchange swaps match 73% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risk upon the remaining 27%.
Details of the Groups foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 25.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2009, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax loss profit would increase decrease by 0.7m 2008: nil, the Groups post-tax loss profit would increase decrease by 0.5m 2008: nil and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.5m 2008: nil.
Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 93 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 26.
Financial risk management continued c Credit risk In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Social Landlords for social housing.
The Group has 86.5m 2008: 66.9m of available for sale financial assets which expose it to credit risk, although this asset is spread over a large number of properties.
As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2009 was 31.0m 2008: 8.6m.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
As at 30 June 2009, the Company was exposed to 1,511.1m 2008: 2,230.1m of credit risk in relation to inter-company loans, financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings.
Further details are provided in notes 34 and 35. d Capital risk management cash flow risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in note 30, and its bank borrowings being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans, as set out in note 24.
The management of these operational risks is set out in note 26b.
In addition, the Group is subject to further land and construction cash flow risks, which the Group has established appropriate controls over in order to appropriately manage its capital, including: Risk Mitigation The timing of conditional land purchase contracts becoming Each division has a site-by-site detailed short-term and medium-term forecasting process including unconditional is uncertain.

In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, assuming the Company is paying a dividend, issuing new share capital, arranging debt to meet liability payments, and selling assets to reduce debt.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
2009 2008 Defined contribution schemes m m Contributions during the year Group defined contribution schemes consolidated income statement charge 3.9 4.9 At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.2m 2008: 0.2m, which were paid on or before the due date.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme which is closed to new entrants.
With effect from 30 June 2009, the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current employees and the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed.
This decision was taken following a detailed consultation process with the Trustees and employee members of the Scheme.
Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 November 2007 and updated to 30 June 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
The projected unit method has been used to calculate the current service cost.
Due to the Scheme ceasing to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions to employees from 30 June 2009, there will be no current service cost in future years.
Following the completion of the Scheme triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes, the Group has agreed to make future contributions to the Scheme, in addition to the normal contribution payment, of 13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 to address the Schemes deficit and the Group will also meet the Schemes administration expenses, death in service premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.4m 2008: 0.4m.
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair bid value.
The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2009 2008 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 6.30% 6.30% Rate of compensation increase 4.40% 4.70% Rate of price inflation 3.40% 3.70% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 6.30% 5.80% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.82% 6.70% Rate of compensation increase 4.70% 5.30% Rate of price inflation 3.70% 3.30% Members are assumed to exchange 10% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Limited, the Groups actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities: Male Female Retired member born in 1935 life expectancy at age 65 21.3 24.4 Non-retired member born in 1965 life expectancy at age 65 23.1 25.9 The base mortality assumptions are based upon the PA92 mortality tables.
The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Schemes membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption.
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium cohort projection.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Increase in scheme liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 4.0m 2.0% Rate of inflation Increase by 0.1% 2.2m 1.1% Life expectancy Increase by 1 year 5.3m 2.6% Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 95 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 27.

The shares are held in the EBT for the purpose of satisfying options that have been granted under The Barratt Developments PLC Executive and Employee Share Option Plans.
These ordinary shares do not rank for dividend and do not count in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares used to calculate earnings per share until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee.
Share-based payments a Details of the share-based payment schemes i Executive Share Option Plan In November 1997, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP.
The grant of share options under the ESOP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998, and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
No options may be granted under the ESOP after 18 December 2007. ii Employee Share Option Plan In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan the Employee Plan.
The Board approves the grant of share options to employees under this Employee Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise of the options granted under the Employee Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 9%.
No options may be granted under the Employee Plan after 10 April 2010.
Those who have participated in the Executive Share Option Plan do not participate in the Employee Share Option Plan.
iii Long-Term Performance Plan The Long-Term Performance Plan the LTPP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect from 1 July 2003.
The LTPP was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2003.
No LTPP awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 June 2009 and the Committee is not proposing to grant any LTPP awards for the financial year ending 30 June 2010.
Instead the Committee has used and will use the ESOS as described on page 46.
Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year.
98 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 29.
Share-based payments continued a Details of the share-based payment schemes continued iii Long-Term Performance Plan continued Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.
There is no re-testing of performance conditions.
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth.
The Committee considers these targets to be the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of the awards, as they are fundamental measures of the Groups underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
The TSR portion of the awards made in 2006 uses a comparator group comprising listed housebuilders as follows: Berkeley Group, Bellway, Bovis Homes Group, Redrow, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey.
For awards made in 2007, the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award comprises those companies, excluding investment trusts, ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index.
For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total award will vest if the Companys TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper quartile or above against the TSR of the comparator group.
10% of the total award will vest if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median.
The award will vest on a straight-line basis between the upper and lower targets.
For awards made in 2006 and 2007, the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%: for performance in between, the awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
The qualifying period for the award granted in 2006 ended on 30 June 2009.
Performance of this award against the constituent TSR and EPS targets was tested after the year end and neither of the targets had been achieved.
Accordingly no part of the 2006 awards will vest.
iv Executive Share Option Scheme In November 2008, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS.
The grant of share options under the ESOS is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, which for options granted in 2008 was based upon Return On Capital Employed ROCE.
There will be no opportunity to retest any performance criteria.
The ROCE performance condition is underpinned by the requirement that the Committee is satisfied that vesting determined by the ROCE condition is such that it correctly reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company across the performance period.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee.
For options granted in 2008, 100% of the option will vest if the ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011 reaches 14.5%, 25% of the award will vest if the ROCE reaches 10.5% and no part of the award will vest if the ROCE is below 10.5%.
ROCE will be calculated as operating profit measured across the whole year to 30 June 2011 divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less any intangible assets being the average of the 12 month end figures during the same year.
The Committee considered that ROCE was the most rounded measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of this award and was satisfied that the ROCE target range represented a stretching target considering the outlook for the housebuilding market.
v Savings-Related Share Option Scheme In November 2008, the Company adopted the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SRSOS.
Under the SRSOS, participants are required to make monthly contributions to an HM Treasury approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of three years.
On entering into the savings contract participants were granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined under the rules of the SRSOS.
The exercise of options under the SRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as the SRSOS is HM Revenue and Customs approved and open to all eligible employees.
The first grant under the SRSOS was made on 3 February 2009 at an exercise price of 87.05 pence per share.

Share-based payments continued vi Management Incentive Plan In May 2009, the Company adopted the Management Incentive Plan 2008-2011 the Plan.
The Plan entitles participants to a cash bonus linked to the Companys share price, subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, based upon ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011.
vii Co-Investment Plan The Co-Investment Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005 and any annual bonus earned above target will normally be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan.
The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan.
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum of four for one for voluntary deferral: matching awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a period of three years.
The relevant performance conditions are the same as those used for the LTPP as detailed on page 98 and 99. b Outstanding equity-settled share-based payments At 30 June 2009, the following options issued in accordance with the rules of the Executive Share Option Plan, the Employee Share Option Plan, the LTPP, the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Co-Investmant Plan and the SRSOS were outstanding: Option Not price 2009 2008 exercisable Date of grant pence Number Number after Executive Share Option Plan 15 October 1998 205 39,000 14 October 2008 30 September 1999 275 34,000 47,000 29 September 2009 27 October 2000 273 31,000 52,000 26 October 2010 1 November 2001 330 44,000 77,764 31 October 2011 22 October 2002 435 257,000 360,738 21 October 2012 10 October 2003 545 696,210 823,210 9 October 2013 Total Executive Share Option Plan options 1,062,210 1,399,712 Executive Share Option Scheme 18 December 2008 approved 61 612,460 17 December 2018 18 December 2008 unapproved 56 6,054,207 17 December 2018 Total Executive Share Option Scheme options 6,666,667 Employee Share Option Plan 10 April 2000 240 9,000 13,000 9 April 2010 29 March 2001 315 10,500 29,500 28 March 2011 25 April 2002 470 41,500 58,000 24 April 2012 14 May 2004 590 389,800 465,450 13 May 2014 Total Employee Share Option Plan options 450,800 565,950 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 3 February 2009 87 9,690,675 30 September 2012 Total share options 17,870,352 1,965,662 Long-Term Performance Plan 18 November 2005 1,040,888 16 November 2006 712,767 712,767 21 December 2007 2,630,229 2,977,041 Total Long-Term Performance Plan 3,342,996 4,730,696 Co-Investment Plan 3 December 2006 13,560 13,674 18 October 2007 88,063 89,769 Total Co-Investment Plan 101,623 103,443 Total 21,314,971 6,799,801 The Executive Share Option Scheme is divided into two sub schemes, one of which is approved under the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003 and the other which is not, and the exercise price is calculated differently for each sub scheme in accordance with the rules of the sub scheme.

i Incident at Battersea Park Road, London One of the Companys principal subsidiaries is BDW Trading Ltd BDW.
On Tuesday 26 September 2006 at Battersea Park Road, London, a tower crane supplied to BDW with operator by a third party contractor collapsed.
The collapse of the crane was not contained within the boundaries of the site and the crane operator and a member of the public were killed.
In addition, significant damage was caused to a neighbouring block of flats and shops which resulted in the evacuation of a number of local residents due to concerns about structural stability.
There is an ongoing criminal investigation currently being carried out by the London Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive to ascertain whether any of the parties involved are criminally liable for manslaughter or under relevant health and safety legislation.
Although no assurance can be given, the Board has been advised that on the information available as at 22 September 2009, being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report and Accounts, the risk of a finding of criminal liability against BDW is low.
A number of civil claims brought against BDW in connection with the same incident have now been settled.
All such claims are covered by the Groups insurance, to the extent not recoverable from the third party contractors insurers.
ii Incident at Bedfont Azure Lakes On 28 February 2008, a resident was found dead and a lodger was found to be in a coma in housing association accommodation at the Bedfont Azure Lakes site developed by BDW.
Police and Health and Safety Executive investigations commenced immediately into possible manslaughter breaches of relevant health and safety legislation.
Claims are being made against BDW by both the housing association and by various residents on the estate where the incident occurred as a result of the disruption caused to them by an evacuation of the surrounding property, by their gas being turned off and by their premises having to be inspected in order to establish whether there was any wider issue with gas installations on the site.
Some residents have claimed retrospectively that they have suffered some of the symptoms of mild carbon monoxide inhalation, such as headaches and dizziness.
Given the nature of these various claims, it is too early to determine the full amount of the damages claimed, which are currently unquantifiable.
The Group is undertaking work to ensure all installations at the site are safe and claims are being dealt with by the Groups insurers, although the extent to which these are covered by the Groups insurance or the insurance of other parties cannot, at present, be clearly ascertained.
Related party transactions a Remuneration of key personnel Disclosures related to the remuneration of key personnel as defined in IAS24 Related Party Disclosures are given in note 9.
There is no difference between transactions with key management personnel of the Company and the Group.
