1 1 2 2 A new spirit We continue to drive ef ciency into every part of our business.
Improving capital ef ciency in our projects and our worldwide drilling operations illustrates our progress.
In 2009, for example, we achieved a BP record launch-to-production time of 18 months with the Savonette project, in Trinidad & Tobago.
This is the fourth of our clone platforms, which follow a standardized design that optimizes the ef ciency of each new platform.
Meanwhile, the culture of continuous improvement in our North Sea drilling team helped to move drilling performance from fourth quartile in 2007 to first quartile in a 2008, and generated additional drilling capital ef ciencies in 2009.
New technology is being deployed in the North Sea too, with conductor splitting technology alone doubling the number of wells we can drill from one platform.
As BP North Sea Wells vice president Morty Denholm expresses it: 3 3 4 Our people are now really motivated and looking forward to delivering even better performance next year.
