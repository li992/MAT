Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below.
a Basis of accounting The consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by, or adopted by, the International Accounting Standards Board the IASB, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The consolidated accounts give a true and fair view and are also in compliance with The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The notes and financial statements are presented in pounds sterling functional and presentational currency and are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the period.
The nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
After making enquiries, and bearing in mind the nature of the Companys business and assets, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
The following new standards have been adopted in the current year: On 6 September 2007, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 1  Amendment, which became effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The statement of changes in equity includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes, if any, disclosed in a single line.
In addition, the standard introduces the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
It presents all items of recognised income and expense either in a single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present one single statement, entitled the Consolidated Income Statement.
On 5 March 2009, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 7 FinancialInstruments:Disclosures, which became effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendments are intended to enhance disclosure about fair value measurement.
On 30 November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 OperatingSegments, which became effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The required disclosures are contained in note 1 h. The following new standards have been issued but are not effective for this accounting period and have not been adopted early: In January 2008, the IASB issued IAS 27  which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
The objective of this standard is to enhance the relevance, reliability and comparability of the information that a parent entity provides in its separate financial statements and in its consolidated financial statements for a group of entities under its control.
In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9 FinancialInstruments which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
This represents the first of a three part project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments:.
The objective of the standard is to enhance the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the accounting of financial assets and to reduce complexity.
The Group does not consider that the future adoption of any new standards, in the form currently available, will have any material impact on the financial statements as presented.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are those entities, including special purpose entities, controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
A group reconstruction took place during 2009, for full details see note 20.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 31 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued b Basis of consolidation continued Following the completion of the group reconstruction, the shareholders in the new legal parent company were substantially the same as those of the previous listed holding company.
These consolidated financial statements have therefore been prepared under IFRS 3 using the reverse acquisition basis of accounting.
Under this basis, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the name of F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited but represent a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary, now called FCPT Holdings Limited.
The comparative information presented in these financial statements, including the equity structure at the end of the comparative period, is that of the legal subsidiary, FCPT Holdings Limited, as at 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2009, the equity structure reflects that of the new legal parent, F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited.
All other reserves recognised in the consolidated financial statements reflect a continuation of the reserves of the legal subsidiary, FCPT Holdings Limited, immediately before the reconstruction.
The difference arising between the nominal value of the total issued share capital including the capital redemption reserve immediately before and after the reconstruction has been recognised through the reverse acquisition reserve.
Following the reconstruction the Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of FCPT Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in Guernsey which was, until the group reconstruction, the top company in the group structure.
The principal activity of FCPT Holdings Limited is now to act as a holding company and owns 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited.
The Company owns indirectly 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Group also consolidates the results of F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Guernsey to issue the interest-bearing bonds.
c Revenue recognition Rental income, excluding VAT, arising on investment properties is accounted for in the Income Statement on a straightline basis over the lease term of ongoing leases.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Distribution income received from the indirect property funds is recognised in the period to which the payment relates.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the Income Statement.
e Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit loss before taxation reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As the Directors consider the value of the property portfolio is likely to be realised by sale rather than use over time, and that no charge to Guernsey or United Kingdom taxation will arise on capital gains, no provision has been made for deferred tax on valuation uplifts.
f Investment properties Investment properties consist of land and buildings held to earn rental income together with the potential for capital and income growth.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including associated transaction costs.
Any subsequent capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period during which the expenditure is incurred and included within the book cost of the properties.
Accounting policies continued f Investment properties continued After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Income Statement and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Fair value is based on the open market valuation provided by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, chartered surveyors, at the balance sheet date using recognised valuation techniques.
These techniques comprise both the Yield Method and the Discounted Cash Flow Method.
In some cases, the fair values are determined based on recent real estate transactions with similar characteristics and location to those of the Companys assets.
The determination of the fair value of investment properties requires the use of estimates such as future cash flows from assets such as lettings, tenants profiles, future revenue streams, capital values of fixtures and fittings, plant and machinery, any environmental matters and the overall repair and condition of the property and discount rates applicable to those assets.
In addition, development risks such as construction and letting risks are also taken into consideration when determining the fair value of investment properties under construction.
These estimates are based on local market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
Techniques used for valuing investment property The Traditional Method converts anticipated future cash flow benefits in the form of rental income into present value.
This approach requires careful estimation of future benefits and application of investor yield or return requirements.
One approach to value the property on this basis is to capitalise net rental income on the basis of an Initial Yield, generally referred to as the All Risks Yield approach or Net Initial Yield approach.
The Discounted Cash Flow Method involves the projection of a series of periodic cash flows either to an operating property or a development property.
To this projected cash flow series an appropriate market-derived discount rate is applied to establish an indication of the present value of the income stream associated with the property.
The calculated periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy and collection losses and less operating expenses outgoings.
A series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the reversion terminal exit value which uses the traditional valuation approach anticipated at the end of the projection period, are discounted to present value.
The aggregate of the net present values equals the market value of the property.
Investment properties held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases are classified as investment properties and stated at fair value.
On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment properties are recognised in the Income Statement and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Sold.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the completion of a sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
g Investments Investments in unquoted indirect property funds are recognised and derecognised on the trade date, and are initially measured at fair value.
Investments in unquoted indirect property funds are financial instruments and are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Accounting standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classification of financial instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Examples of such instruments would be investments listed or quoted on any recognised stock exchange.
The Group held no such securities during the year under review.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such instruments would be those for which the quoted price has been suspended, forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
Level 3 External inputs are unobservable.
Value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
The Groups investments in unquoted indirect property funds are included in Level 3.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 33 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued h Operating segments The Board has considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The Board is of the view that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being property investment, and in one geographical area, the United Kingdom, and that therefore the Group has only a single operating segment.
The Board of Directors, as a whole, has been identified as constituting the chief operating decision maker of the Group.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Groups performance is the total return on the Groups net asset value.
As the total return on the Companys net asset value is calculated based on the net asset value per share calculated under IFRS as shown at the foot of the balance sheet, assuming dividends are re-invested, the key performance measure is that prepared under IFRS.
Therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the financial statements.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash in banks and short-term deposits are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits in banks with an original maturity of three months or less.
j Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Reverse lease premia and other capital incentives paid to tenants are recognised as a current asset and amortised over the period from the date of lease commencement to the earliest termination date.
k Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Fees 000 000 a Investment management fee base management fee 4,185 5,862 performance fee 3,503 7,688 5,862 Throughout the year the Groups investment manager was F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F&C Asset Management plc.
The property management arrangements of the Group have been delegated by FCIB, with the approval of the Company, to F&C REIT Property Asset Management plc, which is also part of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
FCIB is entitled to a base management fee of 0.60 per cent per annum of the Groups invested assets including indirect property holdings and 0.25 per cent per annum of the net current assets, payable quarterly in arrears.
The fees of any managing agents appointed by the investment manager are payable out of the management fee.
FCIB is also entitled to a performance fee equal to 20 per cent of the amount by which the total return whether positive or negative on the directly held properties exceeds 110 per cent of the total return 90 per cent if the total return is negative on the benchmark and multiplied by the Groups average total assets excluding any indirect property holdings.
The benchmark for measuring the comparative performance of directly held properties is the total return from the IPD All Quarterly and Monthly valued funds.
The performance fee payable in each financial year is capped at an amount which, when taken with the aggregate base management fee payable in each financial year, equals 1.0 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
Performance fees in excess of this capped return can be carried forward for up to two subsequent financial years subject to the annual 1.0 per cent cap.
The performance fee is measured over a rolling three year period and the performance fee payable in respect of any one financial year is equal to the total performance fee earned over that three year period less any performance fees already paid in the previous two years.
In the event that the amount already paid in the previous two years is in excess of the amount earned over the rolling three year period, such excess shall be repaid to the Group by FCIB.
The performance fee is accrued based on the amount that would have been payable had the investment management agreement been terminated on the balance sheet date.
No recognition is made of any excess paid by the Group in the previous two years until the Groups entitlement to any repayment is certain.
The calculation for the year to 31 December 2009 resulted in the cap being applied.
Fees continued FCIB is also entitled to an administration fee, which increases annually in line with inflation, and is payable quarterly in arrears.
It received 112,000 for administration services provided in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 107,000.
The investment management agreement may be terminated by either party by giving not less than six months notice.
The agreement may be terminated earlier provided that a payment in lieu of notice, equivalent to the amount the investment manager would otherwise have received during the notice period, is made.
b Valuers fees The valuers of the investment properties, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, have agreed to provide valuation services in respect of the property portfolio.
The valuation agreement is for a fixed term up to 31 December 2010 and an annual fee is payable equal to 0.0165 per cent of the aggregate value of the direct property portfolio.
Other expenses 2009 2008 000 000 Direct operating expenses of let rental property 2,460 2,669 Costs of group reconstruction 506 Valuation and other professional fees 481 617 Provision for bad debts 249 225 Directors fees 149 143 Administration fee 112 107 Auditors remuneration for: audit current year 57 50 audit prior year underprovision 20 other services 9 14 Other 280 252 4,303 4,097 An analysis of the Directors fees is provided in the Report of the Directors on page 19.
The costs of the group reconstruction during the year totalled 873,000.
Of these costs 367,000 related directly to the issue of new Ordinary Shares and have been charged to the Special Reserve.
The remaining costs, totalling 506,000, have been charged through the Income Statement.
Refer to note 20 for details of the reconstruction.

Under IAS 12, the Group is required to provide at the balance sheet date for deferred income tax on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, regardless of whether or not those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The Company is exempt from Guernsey taxation under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989.
A fixed annual fee of 600 is payable to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
The Directors intend to conduct the Groups affairs such that the management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United Kingdom income tax on income arising on the property portfolio after deduction of its allowable debt financing costs and other allowable expenses.

The twelfth, and last, interim dividend in respect of the year, of 0.5p per share, will be paid on 30 April 2010 to shareholders on the register on 16 April 2010.
The ex-dividend date will be 14 April 2010.
Although these payments relate to the year ended 31 December 2009, under IFRS they will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2010, being the period during which they are paid.
It is the Directors intention that the Company will continue to pay dividends monthly.
Earnings losses per share The Groups basic and diluted earnings losses per Ordinary Share are based on the profit for the year of 46,404,000 2008: loss of 284,119,000 and on 680,537,003 2008: 713,355,033 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

Investments continued 2009 2008 000 000 Indirect property funds Opening book cost 34,337 97,730 Opening unrealised depreciation appreciation 29,221 20,921 Opening fair value 5,116 118,651 Sales proceeds 11 43,790 gain loss on sale 11 19,603 Unrealised gains realised during the year 14,589 Decrease increase in unrealised depreciation 956 35,553 6,072 5,116 Closing book cost 34,337 34,337 Closing unrealised depreciation 28,265 29,221 Closing fair value 6,072 5,116 All the Groups investment properties were valued as at 31 December 2009 by qualified professional valuers working for the company of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited DTZ, Chartered Surveyors, acting in the capacity of external valuers.
All such valuers are Chartered Surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
DTZ completed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2009 on a market value basis and in accordance with the requirements of the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by RICS.
Market value is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The difference between the market value and the fair value consists of capital incentives paid to tenants totalling 1,614,000, which is separately recorded in the accounts as a current asset, and the expected costs of sale of 106,000 relating to Leeds, 27 28 Commercial Street which was classified as a property held for sale as at 31 December 2009.
The DTZ valuation report is dated 15 January 2010 the Valuation Report.
Gillian Rushmore BSc, FRICS has been the signatory of valuation reports provided to the Group for the same purpose as the Valuation Report for a continuous period since March 2005.
DTZ has been carrying out valuations for the Group for the same purpose as the Valuation Report for the same period.
DTZ also values properties held by other companies for which the F&C Asset Management plc group is also the investment manager.
DTZ provides, and has provided in the past, ad hoc investment and occupational agency advice, landlord and tenant and building consultancy advice to members of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTZ Holdings plc.
In DTZ Holdings plcs financial year to 30 April 2009, the proportion of total fees payable by the F&C Asset Management plc group to the total fee income of DTZ Holdings plc was less than five per cent.
The Group has adopted IAS 40 revised 2003, allowing leasehold properties to be carried at fair value rather than amortised over the term of the lease.
The same valuation criteria are therefore applied to leasehold as freehold properties.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
Investments continued The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation, when the Managers advise the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 19 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All of the properties per open market value are shown on page 14.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise as described in Liquidity risk in note 17.
The Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of leases are on a full repairing basis and, as such, the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
The Board has appointed an independent valuer to place a market valuation on the units held in the indirect property funds for the Directors to consider.
Market value, which is deemed to equate to fair value, means the estimated amount for which units could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
As the valuation of the units held in the indirect property funds is based on an independent valuers opinion, which is an unobservable input, these holdings have been classified as Level 3 under the hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments required by IFRS 7 revised.
Further detail on the effect of what, in the Boards view, would be a reasonably possible movement in the market price of these units is provided in note 17.
Trade and other receivables 2009 2008 000 000 Accrued income 3,932 3,282 Rents receivable net of provision for bad debts 1,329 1,481 Other debtors and prepayments 139 1,430 5,400 6,193 Rents receivable, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Included within accrued income is the prepayment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease.
Also included within accrued income is 1,614,000 2008: nil relating to capital incentives paid to tenants.
Cash and cash equivalents All cash balances at the year end were held in cash, current accounts or in banks on short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The cash balance at 31 December 2009 includes 2,031,000 2008: 2,344,000 of rent deposits and therefore a corresponding creditor is included within trade and other payables.

The bonds carry interest at a fixed rate of 5.23 per cent per annum and have an expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.60 per cent over six-month LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
These bonds are secured by means of a fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets of the Secured Group which comprises FCPT Holdings Limited, F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited and F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited.

As a result of this reconstruction, one new Ordinary Share in the new legal parent, F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited, was issued for each one Ordinary Share in issue in FCPT Holdings Limited.
F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited therefore issued 680,537,003 new Ordinary shares during the year.
The comparative information presented regarding the equity structure at the end of the comparative period is that of the legal subsidiary, FCPT Holdings Limited.
Apart from the shares issued as part of the reconstruction, the Company did not issue or repurchase any Ordinary Shares during the year.
Subject to the solvency test contained in The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 being satisfied, Ordinary Shareholders are entitled to all dividends declared by the Company and to all of the Companys assets after repayment of its borrowings and ordinary creditors.
Ordinary Shareholders have the right to vote at meetings of the Company.
All Ordinary Shares carry equal voting rights.
At 31 December 2009, the Company did not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.
At 31 December 2008, the legal subsidiary held 72,545,013 shares in treasury.
The shares held in treasury did not form part of the group reconstruction and were therefore not transferred to the new legal parent.

The balance on this account at the time of the group reconstruction in July 2009 has been transferred to the Reverse Acquisition Reserve.
Reverse acquisition reserve Created as a result of the group reconstruction in July 2009 to reflect the difference arising between the total of the issued share capital including the Capital Redemption Reserve immediately before and after the reconstruction.
For further details on the group reconstruction refer to note 20.
Special reserve The Special Reserve was created by the cancellation of FCPT Holdings Limiteds Share Premium Account by the Royal Court of Guernsey in July 2005 and a subsequent smaller cancellation in March 2008.
In addition, approval of the Royal Court of Guernsey was received in March 2008 to reduce the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares from 90p to 1p, resulting in an amount of 679.6 million being transferred from Share Capital to the Special Reserve.
It is a distributable reserve to be used for all purposes permitted under Guernsey law, including the buy back of shares and the payment of dividends.
The costs of the group reconstruction related directly to the issue of new Ordinary Shares of 367,000 have been charged to the Special Reserve.
Capital reserve investments sold The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments and investment properties, including the transfer of any unrealised gains now realised which were previously recognised through Capital Reserve Investments Held: and the buy back of shares up to the balance on this reserve, thereafter any buy back of shares is charged to the Special Reserve.
Capital reserve investments held The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the fair value of investment properties held at the year end: and increases and decreases in the fair value of investments in indirect property funds held at the year end.
Revenue reserve Any surplus arising from the profit after taxation after payment of dividends is taken to this reserve, with any deficit up to the level of the special reserve being transferred from that reserve.
Capital management The Groups capital is represented by the Ordinary Shares, Capital Redemption Reserve, Reverse Acquisition Reserve, Share Premium Account, Special Reserve, Capital Reserve Investments Sold, Capital Reserve Investments Held and Revenue Reserve.
The Group is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.

Financial instruments The Companys investment objective is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for capital and income growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments comprise interest-bearing bonds, cash, and receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not have exposure to any derivative instruments.
The Group is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with financial instruments.
The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
There is no foreign currency risk as all assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Groups risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities exposed to credit risk amounted to the following on a contractual maturity basis : Within More than one year 12 years 25 years 5 years Total Financial assets 000 000 000 000 000 As at 31 December 2009 Investments in indirect property funds 6,072 6,072 Cash and cash equivalents 95,138 95,138 Rents receivable 1,329 1,329 As at 31 December 2008 Investments in indirect property funds 5,116 5,116 Cash and cash equivalents 162,336 162,336 Rents receivable 1,481 1,481 Financial liabilities As at 31 December 2009 Trade and other payables 18,518 18,518 Interest-bearing bonds 12,029 12,029 36,087 236,015 296,160 As at 31 December 2008 Trade and other payables 13,859 13,859 Interest-bearing bonds 12,029 12,029 36,087 248,044 308,189 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 17.
Financial instruments continued In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The Group has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2009 was 1,329,000 2008: 1,481,000.
As at 31 December 2009, rent receivable of 610,000 that was greater than three months overdue was fully provided for.
As at 31 December 2008 the provision was 360,000.
Of this amount 77,000 was subsequently written off, 99,000 is still outstanding and 184,000 was recovered.
Apart from the rent receivable disclosed above there were not any financial assets which were either past due or considered impaired at 31 December 2009 2008: nil.
All of the Groups cash is placed with financial institutions with a long-term credit rating of AA or better.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, cash holdings would be moved to another bank.
During the year, due to the quantum of cash balances held, counterparty risk was spread by placing cash across a number of different financial institutions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property-related assets in which the Group invests are not traded in an organised public market and may be illiquid.
As a result, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly its investments in these properties at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In order to mitigate liquidity risk the Group aims to have sufficient cash balances including the expected proceeds of any property sales to meet its obligations for a period of at least twelve months.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups listed bonds entitle the bondholders to require early repayment and, in such circumstances, the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the Ordinary Shares could be adversely affected.
The Groups investments include investments in indirect property funds which are not traded in an organised public market and which generally may be illiquid.
As a result, similar to the directly-held properties, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in those instruments in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
As at 31 December 2009 the Groups investment in indirect property funds was 6,072,000 2008: 5,116,000.
Interest rate risk Some of the Groups financial instruments are interest-bearing.
They are a mix of both fixed and variable rate instruments with differing maturities.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate risk on long-term debt obligations is managed by fixing the interest rate on such borrowings.
Long-term debt obligations and the interest rate risk they confer to the Group is considered by the Board on a quarterly basis.
Long-term debt obligations consist of 230 million Secured Bonds due 2017 on which the rate has been fixed at 5.23 per cent until the expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.6 per cent over LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
Financial instruments continued The following table sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: Assets Weighted liabilities Weighted average where no average period for Fixed Variable interest is interest which rate Total rate rate received rate is fixed Type 000 000 000 000 % years As at 31 December 2009 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 95,138 43,668 51,470 0.46 0.1 Rents receivable 1,329 1,329 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,308 229,308 5.29 5.5 As at 31 December 2008 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 162,336 130,922 31,414 2.41 0.1 Rents receivable 1,481 1,481 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,197 229,197 5.29 6.5 Apart from the 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds as disclosed in note 13, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value in the financial statements.
Considering the effect on the Secured Bonds, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 14,467,000 2008: 17,314,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 15,800,000 2008: 19,166,000.
The carrying value of the Secured Bonds in the financial statements would have remained unchanged.
When the Group retains cash balances, they are ordinarily held on interest-bearing deposit accounts.
The benchmark which determines the interest income received on interest-bearing cash balances is the bank base rate which was 0.5 per cent as at 31 December 2009 2008: 2.0 per cent.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate or short-term fixed rate bank accounts and not usually in fixed rate securities with a term greater than three months.
Considering the effect on cash balances, an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates would have increased net assets and income for the year by 1,427,000 2008: 2,435,000.
A decrease of 150 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates.
Market price risk The Groups strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the investment policy as outlined within the Report of the Directors on page 17.
The management of market price risk is part of the investment management process and is typical of commercial property investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse valuation movements through detailed and continuing analysis, with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investments in property and property-related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
Such risk is minimised through the appointment of external property valuers.
The basis of valuation of the property portfolio is set out in detail in the accounting policies and note 9.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45 Notes to the Accounts continued 17.
Financial instruments continued Market price risk continued The Group also holds investments in indirect property funds which in turn invest directly in commercial property.
The underlying assets in such funds are valued by external property valuers appointed by the investment managers of the indirect property funds.
In addition to the price risk attaching to the underlying assets, such funds also carry the risk that the investment cannot be disposed of at its net asset value due to a lack of liquidity.
In order to address the fact that the likely realisable value of the indirect property holdings at the balance sheet date may not be equal to each funds underlying net asset value, the Board has appointed an independent valuer to obtain estimated market values for these holdings.
The fair value of these investments is deemed to be the Directors valuation, which reflects these independently produced market values.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Income Statement.
Details of the Groups investment property portfolio and indirect property funds held at the balance sheet date are disclosed on page 14.
A 15 per cent increase in the fair value of the direct properties at 31 December 2009 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 109,685,000 2008: 98,123,000.
A decrease of 15 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
A 25 per cent increase in the fair value of the indirect property funds at 31 December 2009 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 1,518,000 2008: 1,279,000.
A decrease of 25 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations above are based on the investment property and indirect property fund valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Capital commitments The Group had capital commitments totalling 1,829,000 as at 31 December 2009 2008: 2,190,000.
Lease length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on annual rentals : 2009 2008 000 000 Less than one year 3,931 1,000 Between two and five years 73,866 34,838 Over five years 436,525 384,798 Total 514,322 420,636 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 5.1 per cent 2008: 5.7 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value excluding indirect property funds and properties under development was 2.8 per cent 2008: 4.3 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analyses of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in the Managers Review on pages 9 to 13.
Group reconstruction On 5 June 2009, a prospectus and an offer document were sent to shareholders containing details of proposals to introduce a new listed holding company, now called F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited previously called New FCPT Limited, which was incorporated for the purpose of making an offer to acquire all of the previous listed holding companys now called FCPT Holdings Limited issued shares.
The offer became unconditional on 3 July 2009 and, on 7 July 2009, the shares of the new holding company were admitted to listing on the Official List of the UKLA and to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
Also on 7 July 2009, the listing of the shares of the old holding company on the Official Lists of the UKLA and the Channel Islands Stock Exchange, and the trading in its shares on the London Stock Exchange and the Channel Islands Stock Exchange, were suspended.
The listings were cancelled on 4 August 2009.
Under the offer, shareholders were offered one new share in the new listed holding company for each share in the old listed company.
The effect of the transaction was that, during the period under review, the company now called F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited became the new holding company of the Group with the same Board of Directors.
On 9 November 2009 the Board announced that, pursuant to the statutory compulsory acquisition procedure under Guernsey law, F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited had acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of FCPT Holdings Limited, and that the offer was therefore closed and was no longer capable of acceptance.
Post balance sheet events Subsequent to the year end, the Group sold 27 28 Commercial Street, Leeds.
The sale completed on 13 January 2010 with contracts having been exchanged on 24 December 2009.
The property was sold for 8.8 million, which reflected a net initial yield of 5.74 per cent.
Also subsequent to the year end, the Group purchased 77 77a Wigmore Street, London W1 for 2.96 million, reflecting a net initial yield of 4.55 per cent.
The purchase completed on 1 March 2010.
This property occupies an important corner position on the St. Christophers Place Estate.
