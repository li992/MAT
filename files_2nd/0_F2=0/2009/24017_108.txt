Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management The Company is an Investment Company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of public listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and private equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Board sets policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective and meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
Debenture stocks were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
All contracts and compliance with them, including the Debenture trust deed, are agreed and monitored by the Board.
Gearing may be short or long-term in sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
Income earned in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2009 Average 2008 US Dollar 1.6149 1.5593 1.4378 Euro 1.12550 1.1175 1.0344 Yen 150.3345 145.5828 130.3321 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on net asset value NAV per share: 2009 2008 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 708 401 219 589 505 220 Capital Return 65,030 26,445 9,934 65,767 25,619 12,881 Total Return 65,738 26,846 10,153 66,356 26,124 13,101 10.40 4.25 1.61 NAV per share pence 9.77 3.85 1.93 2009 2008 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 708 401 219 589 505 220 Capital Return 65,030 26,445 9,934 65,767 25,619 12,881 Total Return 65,738 26,846 10,153 66,356 26,124 13,101 NAV per share pence 10.40 4.25 1.61 9.77 3.85 1.93 These analyses are broadly representative of the Companys activities during the current and prior year as a whole, although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
Report and Accounts 2009 61 Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management continued Interest Rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2008 2009 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash 5,397 5,397 Borrowings 110,000 110,000 Overdrafts 3,942 3,942 1,371 1,371 Exposure to fixed rates Cash Debentures 110,575 110,575 110,575 110,575 Other borrowings Net exposures At year end 3,942 110,575 114,517 105,974 110,575 216,549 Maximum in year 105,974 110,575 216,549 139,450 110,575 250,025 Minimum in year 62,529 110,575 48,046 87,353 110,575 197,928 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rates applying on the debenture stocks are set out in note 17 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debentures on which the interest rate is fixed.
The debentures are valued in the accounts at par value.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2009 2008 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 79 79 1,019 1,019 Capital return 1,100 1,100 Total return 79 79 2,119 2,119 NAV per share pence 0.01 0.01 0.31 0.31 Other Market Risk exposures The Company does not usually enter into derivative transactions in managing its exposure to other market risks.
The portfolio of investments, valued at 2,074,117,000 at 31 December 2009 2008: 1,998,277,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in note 16 on the accounts.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 62 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued 2009 2008 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 414,823 414,823 399,655 399,655 65.63 65.63 NAV per share pence 58.86 58.86 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, private equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio over 650 at 31 December 2009 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio see note 16 : and the existence of ongoing loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Company does not normally invest in derivative products.
The manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 100m as set out in note 14 on the accounts.
The 11.25% Debenture Stock is governed by a trust deed and is redeemable in 2014 or at an earlier date or dates at the Companys behest.
The Perpetual Debenture Stock is also governed by a trust deed and is redeemable at par only on the security becoming enforceable.
The Board does not therefore consider the repayment of these debenture stocks as a likely short-term liquidity issue.
The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 2009 Current liabilities Overdrafts 3,942 3,942 Other borrowings Other creditors 4,896 4,896 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 8,838 110,575 119,413 2008 Current liabilities Overdrafts 1,371 1,371 Other borrowings 110,000 110,000 Other creditors 4,772 4,772 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 116,143 110,575 226,718 Report and Accounts 2009 63
