Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 135 18 Post-retirement benefits continued Sensitivities The revised investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation on an economic basis.
A reduction of 0.25 per cent in the discount rate would increase the obligations of the principal UK defined benefit schemes by approximately 243m.
An equivalent movement in interest rates would increase the fair value of the assets by approximately 290m.
The difference arises largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting and economic purposes.
On an economic basis the correlation is in excess of 80 per cent.
The principal remaining risks relate to the assumptions for mortality and increases in salaries.
If the age ratings in respect of the principal UK defined benefit schemes were increased by one year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 137m.
If the rate of increase in salaries were 0.5 per cent higher, scheme liabilities would increase by 117m.
The defined benefit obligation relating to post-retirement medical benefits would increase by 47m if the healthcare trend rate increases by one per cent, and reduce by 38m if it decreases by one per cent.
The pension expense relating to post-retirement medical benefits, comprising service cost and interest cost, would increase by 5m if the healthcare trend increases by one per cent, and reduce by 4m if it decreases by one per cent.
