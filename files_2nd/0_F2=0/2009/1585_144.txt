Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the groups financial condition, results of operations and businesses and certain of the groups plans and objectives.
In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements with respect to: the groups expectations regarding its financial and operating performance, including statements contained within the Chairmans Statement and the Chief Executives review: intentions and expectations regarding the development of products, services and initiatives: expectations regarding the global economy and the groups operating environment, including future market conditions and trends: possible future acquisitions, including the timely completion of acquisition transactions: and expectations regarding the groups future operating results.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as anticipates, aims, could, may, should, expects, believes, intends, plans or targets.
By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future.
There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and political conditions in the jurisdictions in which the group operates and changes to the associated legal, regulatory and tax environments: increased competition, from both existing competitors and new market entrants: levels of research and development investment and the groups ability to deploy new technologies, products and services in a timely manner: rapid changes to existing products and the inability of new products to perform in accordance with expectations: the ability of the group to integrate new technologies: the groups ability to generate and grow revenue: a lower than expected impact of new or existing products, services or technologies on the groups future revenue, cost structure and capital expenditure outlays: slower than expected customer growth, reduced customer retention, reductions or changes in customer spending and increased pricing pressure: the groups ability to realise expected benefits from acquisitions, partnerships or other arrangements with third parties: acquisitions and divestments of group businesses and assets and the pursuit of new, unexpected strategic opportunities which may have a negative impact on the groups financial condition and results of operations: the groups ability to integrate acquired business or assets and the imposition of any unfavourable conditions, regulatory or otherwise, on any pending or future acquisitions or dispositions: the extent of any future write-downs or impairment charges on the groups assets, or restructuring charges incurred as a result of an acquisition or disposition: changes in exchange rates, including particularly the exchange rate of pounds sterling to the euro and the US dollar: changes in the regulatory framework in which the group operates: the impact of legal or other proceedings: and changes in statutory tax rates and profit mix, the groups ability to resolve tax issues which may arise and the timing and amount of any payments in respect of tax liabilities.
All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the company or any member of the group or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors referred to above.
No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised.
Subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, Autonomy does not intend to update these forward-looking statements and does not undertake any obligation to do so.
