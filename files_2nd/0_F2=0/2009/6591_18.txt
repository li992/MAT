com Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies and presentation The Groups key accounting policies are summarised below.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements the statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed and adopted for use by the European Union.
These statements have been prepared under the historical cost method except where other measurement bases are required to be applied under IFRS as set out below.
These statements have been prepared using all standards and interpretations required for financial periods beginning 1 January 2009.
No standards or interpretations have been adopted before the required implementation date.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations issued and adopted As outlined in the statements for the year ended 31 December 2008, IFRS 8 Op erating segments and IAS 23 Amendments B orrowing costs were identified as standards likely to impact the reporting of the Groups 2009 results, assets and liabilities with IAS 1 P resentation of financial statements Revised impacting the presentation of financial results.
These standards were adopted on 1 January 2009.
The adoption of IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports used to assess performance and allocate resources by the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive Committee led by the Chief Executive.
The adoption of this standard has not resulted in any change to the segments reported previously with management trading profit maintained as the reportable measure of profit or loss.
The main change has been the inclusion of the Groups share of sales and trading profit of joint ventures within the segmental disclosure and disclosure of management based asset measures.
Management trading profit includes an allocation of costs incurred by central functions in providing operational and regulatory support to the operating segments with the basis of such allocations applied consistently.
Inter segment sales are not significant.
In order to provide comparability with previously reported margins, inter segment sales disclosure is included by way of footnote.
Comparable information has been represented accordingly.
71 IAS 23 requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs attributable to qualifying assets.
The standard has been applied prospectively.
During the year one Aerospace investment programme has been identified as a qualifying asset.
This programme is in its initial stages and as a result there has been no material impact on the results of the Group from the adoption of this standard.
In terms of the presentation of the financial results, the main impacts have been the adoption of IAS 1 P resentation of financial statements Revised with the main presentational changes arising from this standard being the new primary statements S tatement of comprehensive income and S tatement of changes in equity and the amendment to IAS 1 clarifying the classification of derivative financial instruments as current or non-current.
The Group had previously classified derivative financial instruments as current, they are now classified according to their maturity profile with no impact on total assets, total liabilities, results or cash flows.
Comparative data has been restated.
The Group also adopted the following relevant amendments to standards with no material impact on its results, assets and liabilities, IAS 38 I ntangible assets regarding the acceptability of the units of production amortisation method, IFRS 7 F inancial instruments disclosure, including disclosure of the fair value measurement hierarchy and IFRS 2 S hare-based payment regarding vesting conditions and cancellations.
Basis of consolidation The statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together t he Group and the Groups share of the results and equity of its joint ventures.
Subsidiaries are entities over which, either directly or indirectly, the Company has control through the power to govern financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefit from their activities.
Except as noted below, this power is accompanied by a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the Groups results from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
All business combinations are accounted for by the purchase method.
Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value.
In a single case the Company indirectly owns 100% of the voting share capital of an entity but is precluded from exercising either control or joint control by a contractual agreement with the United States Department of Defense.
In accordance with IAS 27 this entity has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
Further details are contained in note 15.
17139 09 03 2010 Proof 25 BACK GKN plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of shareholders earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has a long term interest and exercises joint control with its partners over their financial and operating policies.
In all cases voting rights are 50% or lower.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method.
The Groups share of equity includes goodwill arising on acquisition.
The Groups share of profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and joint ventures are eliminated.
Foreign currencies Subsidiaries and joint ventures account in the currency of their primary economic environment of operation, determined having regard to the currency which mainly influences sales and input costs.
Transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating to the rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of material transactions where actual spot rate may be used if it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Material foreign currency movements arising on the translation of intra-group balances treated as part of the net investment in a subsidiary are recognised through equity.
Movements on other intra-group balances are recognised through the income statement.
The Groups presentational currency is sterling.
On consolidation, results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated to sterling at average exchange rates except in the case of material transactions where the actual spot rate is used if it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
72 Profits and losses on the realisation of currency net investments include the accumulated net exchange differences that have arisen on the retranslation of the currency net investments since 1 January 2004 up to the date of realisation.
Presentation of the income statement IFRS is not fully prescriptive as to the format of the income statement.
Line items and subtotals have been presented on the face of the income statement in addition to those required under IFRS.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of continuing subsidiaries.
Operating profit is profit or loss before discontinued operations, taxation, finance costs and the share of post-tax profit of joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.
In order to achieve consistency and comparability between reporting periods, operating profit is analysed to show separately the results of normal trading performance and individually significant charges and credits.
Such items arise because of their size or nature and, in 2009, comprise: charges relating to the Group-wide restructuring programmes announced in 2004 and 2008: the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review: asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from events which are significant to any reportable segment: amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations: profits or losses on businesses sold or closed which do not meet the definition of discontinued operations or which the Group views as capital rather than revenue in nature: and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments between the opening and closing balance sheets and material currency translation movements arising on intra-group funding transactions.
The Groups post-tax share of joint venture profits is shown as a separate component of profit before tax.
Material restructuring and impairment charges are separately identified.
Net finance costs are analysed to show separately interest payable, interest receivable and other net financing charges.
Other net financing charges include the net of interest payable on post-employment obligations and the expected return on pension scheme assets and unwind of discounts on fair value amounts arising through business combinations.
com 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Revenue recognition Sales Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable which generally equates to the invoiced amount, excluding sales taxes and net of allowances for returns, early settlement discounts and rebates.
Invoices for goods are raised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed which, dependent upon contractual terms, may be at the point of dispatch, acceptance by the customer or, in Aerospace, certification by the customer.
Revenue from royalties and the rendering of services is not significant.
Certain businesses, principally those in Powder Metallurgy, recognise an element of revenue via a surcharge mechanism.
The surcharge invoiced or credited is generally based on prior period movement in raw material price indices applied to current period deliveries.
In those instances where recovery of such increases is guaranteed, irrespective of the level of future deliveries, revenue is recognised, or due allowance made, in the same period as the cost movement takes place.
Other income Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
Revenue from dividends is not significant.
Sales and other income is recognised in the income statement when it can be reliably measured and its collectability is reasonably assured.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Cost Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book values and therefore deemed cost at the date of the 73 IFRS transition.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or capital work in progress.
In the case of all other categories of property, plant and equipment, depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the course of the financial year from the date the asset is available for use.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Years Freehold buildings Up to 50 Steel powder production plant 18 General plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 6 to 15 Computers 3 to 5 Commercial vehicles and cars 4 to 5 Property, plant and equipment is reviewed at least annually for indications of impairment.
Impairments are charged to the income statement.
Similarly, where property, plant and equipment has been impaired and subsequent reviews demonstrate the recoverable value is in excess of the impaired value an impairment reversal is recorded.
The amount of the reversal cannot exceed the theoretical net book amount at the date of the reversal had the item not been impaired.
Impairment reversals are credited to the income statement against the same line item to which the impairment was previously charged.
Costs attributable to leasehold properties are written off to profit by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
17139 09 03 2010 Proof 25 BACK GKN plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as incurred over the lease term.
Finance leased assets are not significant.
Discontinued operations The profit or loss on discontinued operations comprises the trading results up to the date of disposal or discontinuance and the profit or loss on the disposal or closure where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the financial statements are approved.
A discontinued operation is a business or businesses that have either been disposed of or closed or satisfies the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that represents either a material line of business within the Group or within one of its reported segments or a primary geographical area of operation.
Where businesses fall to be treated as discontinued in the current year the comparative data is reclassified to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are capitalised as cost on qualifying tangible and intangible fixed asset expenditure.
A qualifying asset is an asset or programme where the period of capitalisation is more than 12 months and the capital value is more than 10 million.
For general borrowings the capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs outstanding during the period.
For specific funding the amount capitalised is the actual funding cost incurred less any investment income on the temporary investment of those funds.
Financial assets and liabilities Borrowings are measured initially at fair value which usually equates to proceeds received and includes transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of less than 90 days maturity.
Other financial assets comprise investments with more than 90 days until maturity.
Unless an enforceable right of set-off exists and there is an intention to net settle, the components of cash and cash equivalents are reflected on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
74 The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities, including short term receivables and payables, are stated at amortised cost less any impairment provision unless the impact of the time value of money is considered to be material.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments including forward foreign currency contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to i risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or forecast transactions and ii changes in the value of the Groups net investment in overseas operations.
All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.
Where derivative financial instruments are designated as and are effective as cash flow hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is held in equity and recycled through the income statement when the designated item is transacted.
Remeasurement gains and losses on derivative financial instruments held as net investment hedges are recognised in equity via the statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments no longer designated as effective hedges are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised at their fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the derivative are not closely related to the host contract.
Gains and losses arising on the remeasurement of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture is included in the carrying value of the investment.
com 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Where negative goodwill arises, following reassessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the period in which the acquisition is made.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested at least annually for impairment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from the annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, determined as the higher of estimated discounted future net cash flows or recoverable amount on a fair value less cost to sell basis, goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Computer software Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its economic useful life which is in the range of three to five years.
Development costs Where development expenditure results in a new or substantially improved product or process and it is probable that this expenditure will be recovered it is capitalised.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
In Aerospace, amortisation is charged over the asset s life up to maximum of fifteen years either on a straight line basis or, where sufficient contractual terms exist, a unit of production method is applied.
In Automotive, amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the asset s life up to a maximum of seven years.
Capitalised development costs are subject to annual impairment reviews.
75 Research expenditure is written off as incurred.
Assets acquired on business combinations non-operating intangible assets Non-operating intangible assets are intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, which arise from contractual or other legal rights and are not transferable or separable.
On initial recognition they are measured at fair value.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over their expected useful lives which are: Years Marketing related assets brands and trademarks 3050 agreements not to compete Life of agreement Customer related assets order backlog Length of backlog other customer relationships 215 Technology based assets 510 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value with due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost is determined on a first in, first out or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated selling costs and costs to complete.
Taxation Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity when the related tax is also recognised in equity.
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability in the statements and its tax base.
The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against future taxable profits.
17139 09 03 2010 Proof 25 BACK GKN plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of joint ventures.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of overseas branches and subsidiaries except to the extent that it is probable that such earnings will be remitted to the parent in the foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-employment benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements which provide certain employees with defined post-employment healthcare benefits.
The Group accounts for all post-employment defined benefit schemes through full recognition of the schemes surpluses or deficits on the balance sheet at the end of each year.
Actuarial gains and losses are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
Current and past service costs, curtailments and settlements are recognised within operating profit.
Returns on scheme assets and interest on obligations are recognised as a component of other net financing charges.
For defined contribution arrangements the cost charged to the income statement represents the Groups contributions to the relevant schemes in the period in which they fall due.
Government refundable advances Government refundable advances are reported in Trade and other payables in the balance sheet.
Refundable advances include amounts lent by Government, accrued interest and directly attributable costs.
Refundable advances are provided to the Group to part-finance expenditures on specific development programmes.
The advances are provided on a risk sharing basis, i. e. repayment levels are determined subject to the success of the related programme.
Interest is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
76 Share-based payments Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the scheme.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted The Group does not intend to adopt any standard, revision or amendment before the required implementation date.
The following standards and amendments are likely to impact the reporting of the Groups results, assets and liabilities.
IFRS 3 Revised B usiness combinations effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2009.
This standard is to be applied on a prospective basis and will change the recognition of goodwill, acquisition costs and contingent consideration.
The Group is assessing the impact of the following revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations.
IFRS 2 Amendment regarding classification of Group arrangements.
IAS 32 Amendment regarding presentation on classification of rights issues.
IFRIC 18 Transfer of assets from customers.
IFRIC 19 E xtinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments.
IAS 24 Amendment regarding related party transactions.
IAS 39 Amendment regarding eligible hedged items.

IAS 38 Amendment regarding measurement of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
IFRS 5 Amendment including disclosures required in respect of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale or discontinued operations.
IAS 1 Amendment regarding settlement of a liability by the issue of equity.
IFRIC 17 Dis tribution of non-cash assets to owners.
com 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and earnings for the year.
The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of acquired non-operating intangible assets business combinations note 24, post-employment obligations note 26, derivative and other financial instruments notes 3e and 21, taxation note 5 and impairment of non-current assets note 12.
The details of the principal estimates, judgements and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified.
2 Segmental analysis The Groups reportable segments have been determined based on reports reviewed by the Executive Committee led by the Chief Executive.
The operating activities of the Group are structured according to the markets served: automotive, aerospace and off-highway.
Automotive is managed according to product groups: driveline, structural and other components and powder metallurgy.
Reportable segments derive their sales from the manufacture of products.
Revenue from services, inter segment trading and royalties is not significant.

The 2004 programme charges in 2008 related to Driveline.
In response to the severe economic downturn in our automotive markets and in anticipation of activity reductions in both off-highway and aerospace markets, the Group commenced further restructuring in the final quarter of 2008.
The 2008 programme restructuring actions comprise facility and operation closures, permanent headcount reductions achieved through redundancy programmes and the structured use of short-time working arrangements, available through national or state legislation, by European, Japanese and North American subsidiaries.
Where short-time working is utilised as the restructuring response to the severe economic and activity downturn it is the most cost-effective option available at that time.
Employees subject to short-time working arrangements are not engaged in any activity productive or non-productive for or on behalf of the Group.
Short-time working charges represent the labour and associated costs borne by the Group in respect of these employees for the period of short-time work.

Fixed asset impairments relating to this programme were charged in 2008 with subsequent utilisation of some of these assets resulting in partial reversal in 2009.
In Japan, one facility closure was announced in 2009 as part of a facility rationalisation review, with activity transferred to another Japanese operation.
Impairments and reorganisation costs of 5 million were charged.
Elsewhere, headcount reductions have been progressing mainly in Germany, Spain, France and Australia.
Short-time working costs relate mainly to European and Japanese operations.
Closure of one joint venture facility was concluded in the year with another joint venture sold.
The Groups investments in these joint ventures were written off in 2008.
The sale of the latter joint venture enabled a partial reversal of the prior year impairment charge to its net realisable value.
In Other Automotive, actions continue relating to the ongoing rationalisation of a UK facility with charges incurred relating to redundancy and pension costs.
In Powder Metallurgy, the closures of two facilities were announced in the year which, combined with the completion of the closure previously announced in 2008, resulted in a 6 million redundancy and reorganisation charge.
Redundancy costs of 8 million were also charged in relation to ongoing fixed cost reduction programmes across North American and European operations.
Short-time working costs relate mainly to European operations.
In OffHighway, actions have been initiated in the period to concentrate exit production for certain product categories in certain regions and concentrate activities on one area of operation.
As a consequence the closures of five facilities and rationalisation of a sixth have been commenced with an associated cost of 5 million and impairments of 9 million.
Redundancy charges of 11 million were also made in respect of capacity and fixed cost reductions.

This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of differing accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, and hence credits to the income statement, is based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised.
The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules as a consequence of its geographic spread.
It is therefore subject to tax audits which, by their nature, are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
The total accrual for income tax in any period is therefore based on management judgement, interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of challenge of uncertain tax positions and subsequent settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
As amounts set aside in any period could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent periods which may have a material impact on the Groups income statement and or cash tax payments.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items with tax authorities and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Interest on provisions for uncertain tax positions is, where relevant, provided for in the tax charge.
Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this are given on page 24.

com 5 Taxation continued f Franked Investment Income Litigation In September 2003 GKN filed a claim in the High Court of England and Wales t he High Court in respect of various Advance Corporation Tax payments made and Corporate Tax paid on certain foreign dividend receipts which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of GKN s EU community law rights.
GKN joined a Group Litigation Order G LO with several other claimants and a test case was selected from the members of the GLO to proceed to trial on a representative basis.
At the commencement of that trial in June 2004 the High Court referred the test case to the European Court of Justice E CJ for guidance on the issues raised.
In December 2006 the ECJ issued its guidance to the High Court and the test case returned to the High Court for the full trial in July 2008.
The High Court issued its judgment on 27 November 2008.
Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal which heard their pleadings in October 2009 and issued its judgment on 23 February 2010.
The Court s judgment has referred many issues back to the ECJ for clarification but more importantly has held that claims are restricted to six years from the date the disputed tax was paid.
The effect of this, if ultimately upheld, is to deny the vast majority of claims in the GLO.
Given the importance of the matters at issue, it is expected that appeals will ultimately be taken to the new Supreme Court and that this process may take several more years to conclude.
GKN had successfully claimed and received in June 2009 an interim payment on account in the High Court of 4 million which is primarily interest attributable to the claim.
This interim payment is potentially refundable to HMRC as a result of the Court of Appeal judgment and has not, therefore, been recognised in the income statement in the year.
The complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised mean that it is not possible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what the final outcome could be.
The range of possible outcomes is so wide that it is potentially misleading to quote any estimates of the possible recoveries at this stage.
As a result no contingent asset has been recognised and disclosed in these financial statements.
6 Discontinued operations In August 2008, the Group reached agreement with Finmeccanica regarding the 35 million deferred consideration placed into escrow in November 2004, the date of disposal of the Groups 50% share of AgustaWestland.
Under the agreement the 35 million, together with 89 accrued interest, was shared equally.
As a result, 21 million was received, of which 3 million was recognised as interest and 18 million recognised as profit on sale of discontinued operations.
Tax of 5 million was charged against the profit on sale.
In 2009, the prior year tax charge was reversed following agreement of the non-taxable nature of the item with the fiscal authority.

Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 that impact the 2009 accounting charge are: a Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2005, April 2006 and August 2009 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2007 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period.
In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share eps growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with that of comparator companies.
Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant.
Inputs to the valuation model for prior period awards were: option price 163p to 380.3p, volatility 31% to 38%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.28% to 5.40% and expected terms of 6.4 years to 6.7 years.
In respect of the 2009 awards, which were made post the Groups rights issue, the inputs to the valuation model were: option price 110.08p to 113.24p, volatility in the performance period 52.4% to 52.6%, expected dividend yield 4.5%, risk-free interest rates of 2.9% to 3.1% and terms of 6 to 6.5 years.
b Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2006, April 2007 and August 2009 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes, 93 options were granted subject to TSR performance over a three year period compared with a comparator group.
There is no retest facility under either scheme.
Inputs to the valuation model for prior period awards were: option price nil, volatility 23% to 39%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.05% to 5.40% and a term of 3 years to 4 years 9.5 months.
In respect of the 2009 awards, which were made post the Groups rights issue, the inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility nil, expected dividend yield 4.5%, and a term of 4 years.
These awards were only made to main Board Directors.
c Profit Growth Incentive Plan PGIP Awards were made in April 2007 under the PGIP to certain senior employees excluding Directors.
Any benefit under the PGIP will be deliverable dependent upon the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Group over a three year performance period: the Groups reported profit for the year prior to the year of award forms the baseline for this performance measure.
The PGIP is a cash-based incentive plan: however, for certain very senior employees the benefit is deliverable in shares: the number of shares given below will be released following the performance period if the minimum targeted profit growth is achieved.
A maximum of twice the amount of shares listed below will be released on achievement of the maximum profit target, with one and a half times the number being released for interim performance.
No shares will be released and the awards will lapse if the minimum profit target is not achieved.
Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement.
Any awards deliverable under the PGIP will be satisfied from GKN ordinary shares already in issue.
The 2009 PGIP award is a two year award that is entirely cash based and therefore not subject to the IFRS 2 requirements.
Similar to 2007, any benefit under this scheme will be delivered dependent upon the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Group over a two year performance period.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards.
The risk-free interest rate is the rate obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
17139 09 03 2010 Proof 25 BACK GKN plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 11 Share-based payments continued Following the capital reorganisation and rights issue completed in July 2009, adjustments were made to outstanding share-based options and awards granted under the Groups incentive arrangements to reflect the dilutive effect of both transactions.
The adjustments were based on the theoretical ex-rights price TERP formula and were designed to ensure that the value of outstanding options and awards remained the same as the value of the options and awards when originally granted.
The outstanding options and awards were multiplied by a TERP factor of 1.4816 and, where applicable, the exercise price of options was multiplied by a factor of 0.6749.
The adjustments were made in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes and, where necessary, were approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
Further details of the ESOS, LTIP and PGIP schemes are given in the Directors remuneration report on pages 52 to 62.

Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
In the case of an individual CGU within the Groups Aerospace Propulsion Systems business, value in use at 31 December 2009 was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of that CGU s programmes, in particular the growth of certain military programmes.
Goodwill impairment losses During 2009 goodwill impairment losses of 7 million 2008 nil were recorded in relation to a business within the Groups OffHighway segment.
These impairments, which arose as a result of the cessation of production at a European production facility and the strategic decision to exit a specific product market in North America, were determined on a value in use basis using pre-tax discount rates of 12% in Europe 2008 13% and 13% in North America 2008 10%.
17139 09 03 2010 Proof 25 BACK GKN plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 12 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Key assumptions In determining the recoverable amount of all CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain US military and civil programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of ongoing capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based upon long term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates.
A relative risk adjustment or be ta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below has been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Powder Metallurgy: Europe 12% 2008 12% and North America 13% 2008 10%.
96 Long term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts into perpetuity, a long term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published Oxford Economic Forecast average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates from 1% to 9% 2008 1% to 7% with most countries between 2% and 4% in both years.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to likely and potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed.
At 31 December 2009, the date of the Groups annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of two individual CGUs within the Groups Aerospace Propulsion Systems and Driveline Americas operations showed limited headroom with value in use exceeding the carrying values by 5 million and 23 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount rate, long term growth rate and forecast operating cash flow assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to exceed the carrying value.

G ASS which is an entity in which the Group has, since 2003, had a 100% share in the equity.
During 2009 the 1 million provision against the investment was reversed.
The investment is stated at cost.
GASS operates under a Proxy Agreement with the United States Department of Defense developing high technology, classified products for the United States Airforce.
The Proxy Agreement currently places significant restrictions on the Groups management and control of the business so that, in accordance with IAS 27, it has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
In January 2010 clearance was obtained to commence the process to remove the significant restrictions on the Groups management and control of GASS.
At the conclusion of this process GASS will be consolidated.
At 31 December 2009, under the accounting policies of GASS, the excluded net liabilities were 7 million 2008 8 million and the operating profit for the year then ended was 1 million 2008 operating loss of 1 million.
The Group provided services to GASS during 2009 amounting to less than 1 million 2008 nil.
GASS supplied goods to the Group during 2009 amounting to less than 1 million 2008 1 million.

Bonds included within other borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
20 Financial risk management 103 The Groups activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign currency risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward foreign currency contracts, are used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign currency policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons.
The main impact of foreign currency risk on the Groups results arises from the translation into sterling of the results of operations outside of the UK.
The Groups largest exposures are the euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by 0.2 million and 0.7 million respectively.

Analysis of net borrowings by currency: 2009 2008 Cash and Other Cash and cash financial cash Borrowings equivalents assets Total Borrowings equivalents Total m m m m m m m Sterling 548 187 20 341 726 24 702 US dollar 24 18 6 27 15 12 Euro 17 36 19 10 35 25 Others 47 75 28 59 40 19 636 316 20 300 822 114 708 104 b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on fixed rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk on variable rate net borrowings funds.
The Groups policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
This policy remains suspended following a Board decision in December 2004 after receipt of the original sale proceeds on the sale of the GKN share in AgustaWestland given the absence of floating rate bank debt.
At 31 December 2009 86% 2008 83% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2009 204 million 2008 12 million was in bank deposits, of which 186 million 2008 12 million was on deposit with banks in the UK.
A 1% change in interest rates would have a 2.5 million impact on net interest.
This sensitivity flexes the interest rate of variable rate borrowings, assuming the level and currency mix at 31 December 2009 remains in place for 12 months.
com 20 Financial risk management continued c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts.
Operational As tier-one suppliers to automotive, off-highway and aerospace original equipment manufacturers, the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In certain parts of the Group, mainly Industrial Distribution Services within Driveline and OffHighway, there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customer s ability to pay and other factors in the Groups relationship with the customer.
At 31 December the largest five trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major reportable segment is as follows: 2009 2008 % % Driveline 46 48 Powder Metallurgy 20 20 105 OffHighway 35 32 Aerospace 64 54 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 642 million 2008 714 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least AAor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 61 million 2008 12 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2009 to a single bank was nil 2008 nil.
The amounts on deposit at year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to financial credit risk with Group indebtedness varying over the course of a year in line with normal financing and trading patterns.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce borrowings.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of gross borrowings to EBITDA.
The Group seeks to operate at an EBITDA of subsidiaries to gross debt ratio of 2.5 times or less and the ratios at 31 December 2009 and 2008 were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Gross borrowings 636 822 EBITDA 335 377 Gross borrowings to EBITDA ratio 1.9 times 2.2 times The Groups only external banking covenant requires an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or more.
The ratios at 31 December 2009 and 2008 were as follows: 2009 2008 m m EBITDA 335 377 Net interest payable and receivable 64 47 EBITDA to net interest payable and receivable ratio 5.2 times 8.0 times 106 e Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycles at times when peak borrowings are required.
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Groups policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts.
Committed bank facilities total 709 million, of which 350 million expire in July 2010.
There were no drawings on these facilities at 31 December 2009 although 13 million was utilised for Letters of Credit.
Committed facilities are provided through 12 banks.

f Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall financial results.
The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing.
In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments.
The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

Hedge accounting Cash flow hedges The Group manages exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on outstanding purchase and sale agreements using forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has adopted transactional foreign currency hedge accounting in a limited number of contracts.
The net value of forward foreign currency contracts subject to hedge accounting was nil 2008 8 million liability.

Amounts are only set aside when irrevocable commitments exist at the balance sheet date and these invariably reflect actual or constructive contractual arrangements which indicate the amount and most likely timing of flows.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is expected as follows: 17 million in 2011: 2 million in 2012: and 3 million from 2013.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues 109 undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customer s associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent management s best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 6 million in 2011 and 5 million in 2012.
Legal and environmental Legal provisions amounting to 8 million 2008 9 million relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that have arisen in the normal course of business.
Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Groups stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent management s view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts charged and carried reflect the current best estimates of the likely cost of remediation and inherent timings.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 5 million in 2011 and 2 million from 2012.

The main externally funded defined benefit pension schemes operate in the UK, US and Japan.
In Europe, funds are retained within certain businesses to provide defined benefit pension benefits.
In addition, in the US and UK a number of retirement plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment medical benefits.
a Defined benefit schemes measurement and assumptions Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2009.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The reference for the UK discount rate was the yield as at 31 December on the iBoxx GBP Corporate rated AA bonds with a maturity of 15 years plus.
The reference for the European discount rate was the yield as at 31 December on the iBoxx Euro Corporate rated AA bonds with a maturity of 10 years plus of 5.1%, adjusted to reflect the duration of liabilities.
For the USA, the discount rate matched the Citigroup liability index as at 31 December 2009 of 6.0%.
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows: United Kingdom Such is the size and profile of the UK scheme that data on the schemes mortality experience is collected and reviewed annually.
The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme use PA92 Year of Birth tables with a plus 2.5 year age adjustment to reflect actual mortality experience for the scheme together with medium cohort projected improvement in longevity.
Using these assumptions a male aged 65 lives for a further 19.8 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 21 years after retiring at 65.
The prior period valuations used the same mortality assumptions.

In the USA the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 19 years whilst in Germany for a further 18.1 years.
The longevity assumption for a US male currently aged 40 is that he also lives for a further 19 years once attaining 65 years, with the German equivalent assumption being 18.2 years.
These assumptions are based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience.

The 2008 past service cost charge relates to augmentations arising in the UK on redundancy programmes and additional charges in respect of a continental European subsidiary.
The 2009 settlement curtailment credit arises from the closure of two pension schemes to future accrual in the USA together with the impact of redundancy programmes in Japan.
