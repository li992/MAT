Forward-looking statement This report may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to certain of Prudential's plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition, performance, results, strategy and objectives.
Statements containing the words believes, intends, expects, plans, seeks and anticipates, and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking.
By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances which are beyond Prudential's control including among other things, UK domestic and global economic and business conditions, market related risks such as fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, and the performance of financial markets generally: the policies and actions of regulatory authorities, the impact of competition, inflation, and deflation: experience in particular with regard to mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates: the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or combinations within relevant industries: and the impact of changes in capital, solvency or accounting standards, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Prudential and its affiliates operate.
This may for example result in changes to assumptions used for determining results of operations or re-estimations of reserves for future policy benefits.
As a result, Prudential's actual future financial condition, performance and results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in Prudential's forward-looking statements.
Prudential undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report or any other forward-looking statements it may make.
