Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charges A number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the April 2009 Budget Statement which are expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2009.
These changes include temporary changes to the capital allowances regime and the introduction of a system for taxing foreign profits, which is expected to bring in a dividend exemption and a worldwide debt cap.
The dividend exemption is likely to be available for both UK and foreign distributions, falling within an exempt classification, received on or after 1 July 2009.
This is not expected to have a material effect on our future tax charge.
The worldwide debt cap is likely to restrict the amount of finance expense available for UK tax purposes, based on the consolidated finance expense, and is expected to apply for the accounting period ended 31 March 2011 onwards.
We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the worldwide debt cap will have on our future tax charge.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore have not been reflected in these financial statements.

The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
We have made our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2009 relating to gas site decontamination was 85m 2008: 69m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
Emissions provision The provision for emission costs is expected to be settled using emission allowances granted or purchased.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2009, 5m of the total restructuring provision 2008: 6m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, to be paid during 2009 and 2010.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2009 include 12m 2008: 17m in respect of property transfer costs related to the sales of four UK gas distribution networks and 21m 2008: 18m in respect of employer liability claims.
The payment dates for the property transfer costs are uncertain but should largely be over the next two years.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.

e Parent Company loan guarantees on behalf of subsidiaries The Company has guaranteed the repayment of principal sums, any associated premium and interest on specific loans due from its financial subsidiaries to third parties.
At 31 March 2009, the sterling equivalent amounted to 1,487m 2008: 1,159m.
f Litigation and claims In last year's Annual Report and Accounts, we reported a decision by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority GEMA to levy on us a fine of 41.6m for a breach of the UK Competition Act 1998 in respect of term contracts with suppliers entered into by our UK metering services business in 2004.
We also noted that we had appealed this decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal the Tribunal.
On 29 April 2009, the Tribunal overturned the decision in part and reduced the fine to 30m but upheld the original decision in part.
On 29 May 2009, we lodged our application at the Tribunal for leave to appeal on points of law and on the amount of the penalty.
As at this date therefore, we remain of the view that an outflow of economic benefits is not probable, and as a result, no provision has been made in these accounts either for the reduced fine of 30m, or for any other possible financial impact of the ruling.
In October 2008, we informed Ofgem that our mains replacement activity carried out within the UK's West Midland Alliance partnership may have been misreported.
National Grid and Ofgem have jointly appointed Ernst & Young to carry out a full investigation to determine the extent of the issue.
At present it is too early to determine the likely outcome of the investigation and any potential consequences.

Actuarial information on pensions The National Grid UK Pension Scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is subject to independent actuarial valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers' contribution which, together with the specified contributions payable by employees and the proceeds from the scheme's assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The scheme provides final salary defined benefits for employees who joined prior to 31 March 2002 and defined contribution benefits for employees joining from 1 April 2002.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP at 31 March 2007.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was 12,923m and the value of the assets represented 97% of the actuarial value of benefits due to members, calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2007 on an ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.
There was a funding deficit of 442m 309m net of tax on the valuation date in light of which National Grid agreed a recovery plan with the trustees.
The results of the actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 32.4% of pensionable earnings 29.4% employers and 3% employees.
In addition, the employers pay an allowance for administration expenses which was 3.2% of pensionable earnings for 2008 09, giving a total Company rate of 32.6% of pensionable earnings.
These contribution rates will be reviewed at the next valuation on 31 March 2010.
In accordance with the recovery plan agreed with the trustees at the 2007 Valuation date, NGG paid contributions of 228m 164m net of tax in the year to 31 March 2009 and a further payment of 58m 42m net of tax in April 2009 to ensure that the deficit revealed at the 2007 valuation is paid in full.
Asset allocations and actuarial assumptions The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Equities 33.9 33.8 Corporate bonds 34.7 26.7 Gilts 21.0 29.9 Property 5.5 6.8 Other 4.9 2.8 Total 100.0 100.0 The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the scheme.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the scheme's actuaries.
The current target asset allocation for the scheme is 34% equities, 58% bonds and 8% property and other.
2009 2008 The principal actuarial assumptions used were: % % Discount rate i 6.8 6.6 Expected return on plan assets 6.4 6.1 Rate of increase in salaries ii 3.8 4.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 3.8 Rate of increase in Retail Prices Index 2.9 3.7 i The discount rate for pension liabilities has been determined by reference to appropriate yields prevailing in the UK debt markets at the balance sheet date.
ii A promotional age related scale has been used where appropriate.

Supplementary information on derivative financial instruments Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, or other indices.
Derivatives enable their users to alter exposure to market or credit risks.
We use derivatives to manage our treasury risks.
Treasury financial instruments Derivatives are used for hedging purposes in the management of exposure to market risks.
This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from the maturity and other risk profiles of its assets and liabilities.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained in note 30.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
These are described as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixedrate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in remeasurements within the income statement.
If the hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the life of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained to manage this exposure and, where they qualify, designated as cash flow hedges.
Fair value changes on designated cash flow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, they are designated as cash flow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to remeasurements within the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.
National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 71 30.
Financial risk Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk: fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Boards of Directors of National Grid plc and NGG.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity as discussed further in our treasury policy, described on page 24 of the Operating and Financial Review.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk NGG is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from non-sterling future commercial transactions and non-sterling recognised assets and liabilities.
With respect to near term foreign exchange risk, we use foreign exchange forwards to manage foreign exchange transaction exposure.
Our policy is to hedge a minimum percentage of known contracted foreign currency flows in order to mitigate foreign currency movements in the intervening period.
Where cash forecasts are less certain, we generally cover a percentage of the foreign currency flows depending on the level of agreed probability for those future cash flows.
During the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign exchange risk as follows: 2009 Sterling Euro US dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents ----- Financial investments 1,008 1 - - 1,009 Borrowings 6,296 1,323 793 260 8,672 Pre-derivative position 5,288 1,322 793 260 7,663 Derivative effect 1,582 1,332 773 260 783 Net debt position 6,870 10 20 - 6,880 2008 Sterling Euro US dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 5 - - - 5 Financial investments 518 - - - 518 Borrowings 5,584 336 504 392 6,816 Pre-derivative position 5,061 336 504 392 6,293 Derivative effect 1,103 340 490 392 119 Net debt position 6,164 4 14 - 6,174 Includes bank overdrafts There was no significant currency exposure on other financial instruments, including trade receivables and payables and other receivables and payables.

Financial risk continued a Market risk continued ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on our borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose NGG to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose NGG to fair value interest rate risk.
Our interest rate risk management policy as further explained on page 25 is to minimise the finance costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt subject to certain constraints.
Some of our borrowings issued are index-linked, that is their cost is linked to changes in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI.
We believe that these borrowings provide a good hedge for revenues and our regulatory asset values that are also RPI-linked.
Interest rate risk arising from our financial investments is primarily variable being mainly composed of short dated money funds.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: 2009 2008 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 702 631 In more than one year but not more than two years 1 533 In more than two years but not more than three years - - In more than three years but not more than four years 21 15 In more than four years but not more than five years 752 - In more than five years 2,952 1,871, 4,428 3,050 Floating interest rate borrowings including RPI 4,243 3,766 Non-interest bearing borrowings 1 - Total borrowings 8,672 6,816 During the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2009 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents ----- Financial investments - 1,009 - - 1,009 Borrowings 4,428 1,146 3,097 1 8,672 Pre-derivative position 4,428 137 3,097 1 7,663 Derivative effect 1,407 876 249 3 783 Net debt position iii 3,021 1,013 2,848 2 6,880 2008 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents - 5 - - 5 Financial investments - 518 - - 518 Borrowings 3,050 1,012 2,754 - 6,816 Pre-derivative position 3,050 489 2,754 - 6,293 Derivative effect 1,093 982 - 8 119 1,957 1,471 2,754 8 6,174 Includes bank overdrafts i The post-derivative impact represents financial instruments linked to UK RPI.

National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 73 30.
Financial risk continued b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a portfolio basis for National Grid as a whole.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
Our limits are managed by the central treasury department of National Grid plc, as explained in our treasury policy on page 24.
As at 31 March 2009 and 2008, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
We do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under derivative financial contracts as shown in note 13 was 892m 2008: 229m : after netting agreements it was 847m 2008: 180m.
This exposure is further reduced by collateral received as shown in note 16.
Wholesale and retail credit risk Our principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These lay down the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value for each credit rating.
Sales to retail customers, such as those requiring connections, are usually settled in cash or using major credit cards.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 15. c Liquidity analysis We determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12 month period.

Financial risk continued d Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK Retail Prices Index.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant, and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended, as all of these items varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set.
Therefore, a change in interest rates affects a full twelve-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: and sensitivity to the Retail Prices Index does not take into account any changes to revenue or operating costs that are affected by the Retail Prices Index or inflation generally.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK Retail Prices Index and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.
2009 2008 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity - m - m - m - m UK Retail Prices Index - 0.50% 10 - 10 - UK interest rates - 0.50% 716 512 The income statement sensitivities impact interest expense and financial instrument remeasurements.
e Capital and risk management NGG's objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to remain within regulatory constraints.
The principal measure of balance sheet efficiency is gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of regulatory asset value.
The gearing ratio at 31 March 2009 was 60% compared with 55% at 31 March 2008.
We regularly review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to manage the level of gearing.
Our licence and some of our bank loan agreements impose lower limits for the long-term credit ratings that the Company must hold.
These requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance.

Share options and reward plans National Grid operates three principal forms of share option and award plans in which our employees and Directors participate.
These are an employee Sharesave scheme, a Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Share Plan.
Active share plans The Sharesave scheme is savings related where, under normal circumstances, share options are exercisable on completion of a three or a fiveyear Save-As-You-Earn contract.
The exercise price of options granted represents 80% of the market price at the time of the invitation.
Under the PSP, awards have been made to Directors and approximately 121 senior employees.
Awards made in 2004 have lapsed.
For awards made from 2005, the criteria was amended so that 50% is based on National Grid's Total Shareholder Return TSR performance when compared to the FTSE 100 and 50% is based on the annualised growth of National Grid's earnings per share compared to the growth in RPI the general index of retail prices for all items.
Awards are delivered in National Grid plc shares.
Under the Deferred Share Plan, one half of any bonus earned by Executive Directors of National Grid plc and a predetermined part of any bonus earned by other Directors and senior employees is automatically deferred into National Grid shares.
The shares are held in trust for three years before release.

Non-active share plans We also have a number of historical plans under which awards are still outstanding, but no further awards will be granted.
These include the Executive Share Option Plan and the Share Matching Plan.
The Executive Share Option Plan applied to senior executives, including Executive Directors of National Grid plc.
Options granted were subject to the achievement of performance targets related to National Grid's TSR over a three-year period and those for 2000 are subject to a final retest in 2010 after which they will lapse if the performance criteria is not met.
The share options are generally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant if the relevant performance target is achieved.
The Share Matching Plan applied to Executive Directors of National Grid plc and other Directors and senior employees whereby a predetermined part of each participants bonus entitlement is automatically deferred into National Grid plc shares known as qualifying shares and a matching award may be exercised under the Plan after a three-year period, provided the Director or senior employee remains employed by National Grid.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of options in the employee Sharesave scheme at 31 March 2009 was 2 years and 2 months.
These options have exercise prices between 3.17 and 6.55.
The weighted average share prices at the exercise dates were as follows: 2009 2008 Sharesave scheme options 6.99 7.79 Executive Plan options 6.81 7.68 Additional information in respect of share options Options outstanding and exercisable and their weighted average exercise prices for the respective ranges of exercise prices and years at 31 March 2009 are as follows: Weighted average Weighted average exercise price of exercise price of Normal exercisable outstanding Exercise price dates options Number options Number per share of exercise exercisable outstanding pence years Executive plan - - 5.27 16,693 526.00-531.50 2004-2011 4.40 68,499 4.40 68,499 434.25-460.25 2000-2013 4.40 68,499 4.57 85,192 National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 77 31.
Share options and reward plans continued Share-based payment charges The charge to the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2009 was 6m 2008: 6m.
Awards under share option plans The average share prices at the date of options being granted, the average price of the options granted and their estimated average fair values during each of the two financial years ended 31 March were as follows: 2009 2008 Average share price 684.0p 846.0p Average exercise price 488.0p 655.0p Average fair value 166.8p 189.3p These amounts have been calculated in respect of options where the exercise price is less than the market price at the date of grant.
The fair values of the options granted were estimated using the following principal assumptions: 2009 2008 Dividend yield % 5.0 4.5 Volatility % 22.4-26.1 15.6-18.9 Risk-free investment rate % 2.5 4.2 Average life years 3.9 3.7 The fair values of awards under the Sharesave scheme have been calculated using the Black-Scholes European model.
This is considered appropriate given the short exercise window of sharesave options.
The fair values of awards made in 2008 and 2007 onwards have been calculated by reference to the 2006 Black-Scholes European model calculation.
Volatility was derived based on the following and is assumed to revert from its current implied level to its long run mean based historical volatility under ii below: i implied volatility in traded options over National Grid plc's shares: ii historical volatility of National Grid plc's shares from October 2002 the date of the business combination of National Grid Group plc and Lattice Group plc, and iii implied volatility of comparator companies where options in their shares are traded.
Awards under other share scheme plans The average share prices and fair values at the date share awards were granted during each of the financial years ended 31 March were as follows: 2009 2008 Average share price 670.1p 766.9p Average fair value 458.1p 522.8p The fair values of the awards granted were estimated using the following principal assumptions: 2009 2008 Dividend yield % 4.4 4.4 Risk-free investment rate % 2.5 4.1 Fair values have been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model for awards with total shareholder return performance conditions made prior to 1 April 2006.
The fair value of awards made in 2008 and 2007 has been calculated by reference to the 2006 Monte Carlo simulation model calculation.
Fair values of awards with performance conditions based on earnings per share have been calculated using the share price at date of grant less the present value of dividends foregone during the performance period.
For other share scheme awards, where the primary vesting condition is that employees complete a specified number of years service, the fair value has been calculated as the share price at date of grant, adjusted to recognise the extent to which participants do not receive dividends over the vesting period.
Volatility for share awards has been calculated on the same basis as used for share options as described above.
