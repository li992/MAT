Provisions for liabilities and charges Deferred Environmental Emissions Restructuring taxation Other Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2008 44 5 21 784 46 900 Charged to profit and loss account 13 6 34 8 16 77 Transferred to reserves - - - 16 - 16 Utilised 3 - 12 - 15 30 Released - 9 - - - 9 Unwinding of discount 2 - - - 1 3 At 31 March 2009 56 2 43 808 48 957 Environmental provision The environmental provision represents the net present value of the estimated statutory decontamination costs of old gas manufacturing sites owned by National Grid Gas discounted using a nominal rate of 2.0%.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
We have made our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2009 relating to gas site decontamination was 85m 2008: 69m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
Emissions provision The provision for emission costs is expected to be settled using emission allowances granted or purchased.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2009, 5m of the total restructuring provision 2008: 6m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, to be paid during 2009 and 2010.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2009 include 12m 2008: 17m in respect of property transfer costs related to the sales of four UK gas distribution networks and 21m 2008: 18m in respect of employer liability claims.
The payment dates for the property transfer costs are uncertain but should largely be over the next two years.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.
Deferred taxation comprises: 2009 2008 m m Accelerated capital allowances 796 784 Other timing differences 12 - 808 784 Deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses of 24m 2008: 18m have not been recognised as their future recovery is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
The capital losses are available to carry forward indefinitely.
The capital losses can be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
There are no other significant unrecognised deferred tax assets or liabilities 2008: nil.

At 31 March 2009, the sterling equivalent amounted to 1,487m 2008: 1,159m.
e Litigation and claims In last year's Annual Report and Accounts, we reported a decision by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority GEMA to levy on us a fine of 41.6m for a breach of the UK Competition Act 1998 in respect of term contracts with suppliers entered into by our UK metering services business in 2004.
We also noted that we had appealed this decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal the Tribunal.
On 29 April 2009, the Tribunal overturned the decision in part and reduced the fine to 30m but upheld the original decision in part.
On 29 May 2009, we lodged our application at the Tribunal for leave to appeal on points of law and on the amount of the penalty.
As at this date therefore, we remain of the view that an outflow of economic benefits is not probable, and as a result, no provision has been made in these accounts either for the reduced fine of 30m, or for any other possible financial impact of the ruling.
In October 2008, we informed Ofgem that our mains replacement activity carried out within the UK's West Midland Alliance partnership may have been misreported.
National Grid and Ofgem have jointly appointed Ernst & Young to carry out a full investigation to determine the extent of the issue.
At present it is too early to determine the likely outcome of the investigation and any potential consequences.
Related parties Subsequent to the sale of Advantica Limited, a former fellow subsidiary of National Grid plc, on 31 August 2007, the Company purchased services amounting to nil from Advantica 2008: 9m.
