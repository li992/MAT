Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 12 September 2009 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 359m 2008 357m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 789 million 2008 790 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, the inventory fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Azucarera, exceptional items and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options and share incentives.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 789 million 2008 790 million.
There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment Goodwill As at 12 September 2009, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 1,291m.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows: 2009 2008 cash-generating unit cgu or group of cgus Primary reporting segment m m ACH Grocery 231 225 AB Mauri Ingredients 330 297 Twinings Ovaltine Grocery 119 119 Capullo Grocery 58 58 Illovo Sugar 168 143 AB World Foods Grocery 58 58 Northern China Sugar Sugar 60 56 Other Various 267 264 1,291 1,220 The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs is not individually significant.
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
These calculations are performed annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs based on the most recent budget.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budget are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks of the business if necessary.
The rates used vary between 8% and 11%.
The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5%.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region.
In these circumstances, the cash flow forecast is extended to between three and five years using specific growth assumptions.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Each of the groups CGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review with the exception of the recently acquired sugar business in north east China.
A significant national sugar stock overhang from 2007 8, depressed prices and a reduced crop in the north with exceptionally low sugar content impacted operating costs.
Current forecasts support the carrying value of the assets of the business but the achievement of these forecasts depends on the recovery of sugar prices, improvements in agricultural yields, and higher factory volumes.

Employee entitlements The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
The group also operates a small number of unfunded overseas postretirement medical benefit schemes.
UK schemes The groups principal UK defined benefit pension schemes are funded schemes and are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for other employees.
The pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, and are reflected in the balance sheet at 12 September 2009.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested.
The last actuarial valuation of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2008.
At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,223m and represented 93% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the actuarial valuation, the group agreed to make five annual payments of 30m in order to eliminate the deficit at 5 April 2008.
The first of these payments was made in March 2009.
Overseas schemes The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, the Philippines, Thailand, South Africa and Zambia.
These schemes are primarily funded schemes.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Assumptions The UK pension schemes represent 90% 2008 91% of both the groups scheme assets and scheme liabilities.
The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, are: 2009 2008 2007 % % % Discount rate 5.7 6.0 5.8 Inflation 3.5 3.7 3.3 Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 5.2 4.8 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3 3.5 3.1 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.5 3.7 3.3 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 generational mortality tables with medium cohort improvements and an underpin improvement, as published by the Institute of Actuaries.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2009 2008 life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2009 20.8 22.7 20.7 22.6 Member aged 65 in 2029 22.6 24.2 22.5 24.1 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The UK schemes net pension liability of 76m 2008 85m asset plus the overseas schemes net pension liability of 30m 2008 24m liability totals a liability of 106m 2008 61m asset.
This equates to the employee benefits asset of 16m 2008 106m and liability of 122m 2008 45m shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.

Other deferred tax assets totalling 11m 2008 6m have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
In addition, there are temporary differences of 1,778m 2008 1,460m relating to investments in subsidiaries.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions 2009 During the period, the group completed the acquisition of the Iberian sugar business, Azucarera Ebro, together with a small feed mill in the UK and a sugar cane farm in Zambia, as well as a number of other small acquisitions.
Costs associated with these acquisitions are included within cash and deferred consideration.
Deferred consideration was paid in respect of the beet sugar operations acquired in north east China last year.
The acquisitions had the following effect on the groups assets and liabilities: Pre-acquisition Recognised carrying values on amounts acquisition Note m m net assets Intangible assets 8 5 54 Property, plant & equipment 9 202 218 Biological assets 3 8 Joint ventures and associates 12 12 Other non-current receivables 52 52 Inventories 156 169 Trade and other receivables 61 61 Other financial assets 2 2 Cash and cash equivalents 1 1 Trade and other payables 130 130 Overdrafts 4 4 Interest-bearing loans 121 121 Taxation 37 23 Provisions 92 92 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 184 253 Goodwill 18 Minority interests 3 Total consideration 268 satisfied by Cash consideration 235 Deferred consideration 17 Consideration previously paid 16 net cash Cash consideration 235 Net overdrafts acquired 3 Cash consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions 11 249 The differences between pre-acquisition carrying amounts and amounts recognised on acquisition, which include fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities acquired, are 49m of intangibles recognised, a 16m upward adjustment to property, plant & equipment, a 5m upward adjustment to biological assets, a 13m revaluation of inventories including 12m in respect of the Azucarera acquisition and a 14m adjustment to deferred tax.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability from the sale of the groups existing products in new markets, and the anticipated future technological and operational synergies from the combinations.
The acquisitions in aggregate contributed revenue of 136m and adjusted profit before tax of 1m for the period between the dates of acquisition and 12 September 2009.
Aggregate contributions to revenue and profit before tax had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period have not been disclosed, as appropriately consolidated financial information prepared under Adopted IFRS is not available.
The net cash of 249m in the acquisition table above differs from the cash flow on purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement by 17m.
The difference relates to amounts paid for investments in joint ventures.
The goodwill of 18m in the acquisition table above differs from the amount shown for business combinations in note 8 by 10m.
This relates to the loss on disposal of the manufacturing plant in Portugal, included in the disposals table in this note, which has been treated as goodwill arising on the acquisition of the remaining Gilde businesses.

Acquisitions and disposals continued Acquisition of Azucarera Ebro The acquisition of Azucarera was completed on 30 April 2009.
It contributed a net profit of 1m to the consolidated adjusted net profit for the year since acquisition date.
The contribution to consolidated revenues and net profit had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year has not been disclosed, as it would be impractical to determine these amounts.
This is because the entity acquired did not prepare consolidated financial statements and reported to a 31 December year end.
2008 During 2008, the group completed the merger of Ryvita and Jordans and the acquisition of certain of the European assets of Gilde Bakery Ingredients, 11 beet sugar factories in north east China and the KR Castlemaine meat and smallgoods business in Australia.

The group also sold the former Gilde Bakery Ingredients business in Iberia together with our manufacturing plant in Portugal and the Pongola mill in South Africa.
Costs associated with these disposals are included within cash and deferred consideration.

In August 2009, agreement was reached to sell the Polish sugar business, completion of which is subject to competition clearance.
Assets and liabilities of this business have been included in the consolidated balance sheet as held for sale pending competition clearance.
The net cash of 22m in the disposal table above differs from the cash flow on sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement by 123m.
Of this difference, 122m relates to advance consideration received in respect of the agreement to dispose of the Polish sugar business, as described above.
The remaining 1m was received in respect of a reduction in stake in a joint venture.
Share-based payments The group had the following equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme This scheme was established by the Company in 1994.
Under the terms of the 1994 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company were granted to selected qualifying employees over the ten years from November 1994.
The options must be held for five years before they become exercisable.
The exercise of options is not subject to specified performance criteria.
Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme This scheme was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 15 December 2000.
Under the terms of the 2000 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company may be granted to selected employees over the ten years from 15 December 2000.
The options must be held for three years before they become exercisable.
The exercise of an option under this scheme will, in accordance with institutional shareholder guidelines, be conditional on the achievement of performance criteria which are based on growth in the groups profits.

Fair values The weighted average fair values for the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were determined using a binomial lattice model for share options or by taking the market price of the shares at the time of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period for conditional allocations of shares.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was 610 pence 2008 837 pence and the weighted average share price was 656 pence 2008 900 pence.
The dividend yield used was 2.5%.
No options were granted under the 1994 Scheme or the 2000 Scheme in either 2008 or 2009.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants under these plans made after 7 November 2002 and unvested at 18 September 2004.
The group recognised a total equity-settled share-based payment expense of 5m 2008 5m.

Financial instruments continued The financial instruments shown above include 17m trade and other receivables 2008 nil, 8m cash and cash equivalents and 21m trade and other payables 2008 nil that are classified as held for sale at year end.
Other financial assets on the face of the balance sheet comprise other current investments and derivative assets.
Other financial liabilities comprise derivative liabilities.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 1.
C ash and cash equivalents have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities or otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
Other non-current inv estments recorded within other non-current receivables comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them.
Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price is used to estimate fair value.
The f air values of finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The f air values of trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
Other current investments primarily comprise debt securities and time deposits, which are stated at fair value, based on cost for instruments similar in nature to cash and cash equivalents or on current market prices.
The fair value of derivatives is determined either by reference to third-party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable market prices.
The groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is therefore almost always available to assist with the valuation of derivatives.
The fair values of trade payables, other payables and accruals have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
The fair values of all bank loans, overdrafts and debenture stock have been calculated using the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The fair values of finance lease creditors have been estimated by discounting expected cash flows.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Consequently, the fair value has been presented as book value.
b Derivative financial instruments The carrying amount of derivative financial instruments at the reporting date set out below is classified as current on the face of the balance sheet.
An analysis of derivatives that are designated in a formal hedging relationship, and those that are not, is shown above.

The groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in a wide variety of locations around the world.
These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
Trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures, and, where appropriate, options.
These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executive management.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
Treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
The groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.
92 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 25.
Financial instruments continued e Foreign currency translation The group presents its financial statements in sterling.
As a result of its diverse worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings, and where they are not in sterling, these borrowings are designated as net investment hedges.
This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to equity, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings, nor does it use derivatives to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
The group also designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21.
The effect of the designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted for directly within equity.
The group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in euros and US dollars.
The value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2009 2008 m m Euro 229 285 US dollar 279 190 508 475 The foreign exchange loss of 27m 2008 58m loss on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation.
f Market risk Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective.
The group obtains hedge accounting for the majority of these contracts.
Some commodity derivatives are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting under IAS 39 are able to be satisfied.
This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
While such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure, formal hedge accounting may not be possible for reasons including: where the derivatives are in respect of a similar but different commodity to that being hedged: where exchange-traded derivatives are used that are not sufficiently close in all respects for example quality attributes to the business requirement: or where the exchange used is foreign to the business.
Where hedge accounting for commodity derivatives within the scope of IAS 39 is not available, the instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.

Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the groups results and the groups equity of changes in commodity market prices as a result of entering into financial instruments including derivatives.
The only financial assets and liabilities expected to show any sensitivity in this respect are commodity derivatives.
The sensitivity chosen is a 20% increase in the forward curves for various commodity prices as if they had occurred on 12 September 2009.
For as long as the group continues to make limited use of options, a 20% decrease in forward prices would produce a broadly equal and opposite impact on profit and equity to that shown.
The movement of forward price curves by 20% is considered to be a reasonable approximation of how much markets might typically move, on average, over any given year, notwithstanding that the increases in some commodity prices during the past year have been significantly greater than this.
The sensitivity analysis addresses the impact on year end financial assets and liabilities, and is not an estimate of what profit might have been if commodity prices had been uniformly different throughout the year.
The following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of these sensitivities, which are presented before taxation and minority interests: all qualifying cash flow hedges at 12 September 2009 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting: and commodity contracts that qualify for the own use treatment continue to do so.
This sensitivity therefore has no impact for these contracts.
2009 2008 impact on 2009 impact on 2008 profit for impact on profit for impact on the year total equity the year total equity - m - m - m - m 20% increase in commodity prices 1 8 4 20 ii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates.
Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments: and interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates.
Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
The groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for the majority of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk and interest rate swaps are sometimes entered into in more volatile markets.
At 12 September 2009, 592m 43% 2008 222m and 19% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest.
The groups fixed rate debt includes the US Private 3 Placement loan of 378m 2008 nil and the 150m 10 4% secured redeemable debenture stock 2013 2008 150m.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates eg LIBOR.
Sensitivity analysis Applying a 100 basis point parallel increase in the interest rate yield curve as if it had occurred on 12 September 2009 results in no impact on profit for the year or total equity 2008 no impact on profit or total equity.
The following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests: the impact of this sensitivity has only been recorded for changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which have their fair value gains and losses recorded within the financial statements, assets available for sale, and other current investments, as the group does not designate any other financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and these are the only significant financial instruments whose carrying amounts change as a result of changes in interest rates.
All other financial instruments are carried at amortised cost: no impact is recorded in respect of changes in interest rates on employee benefits including pensions, or discount rates applied to financial instruments to record them at present value: and all qualifying cash flow hedges at 12 September 2009 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting.
94 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 25.
Financial instruments continued A second sensitivity analysis calculates the impact on profitability of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on floating rate interest-bearing loans and overdrafts, and on cash and cash equivalents balances on which variable rates of interest are earned.
The year end cash balance is deducted from the year end floating rate loans and overdrafts balance.
This net floating rate borrowing figure is multiplied by 1%.
In 2009, this equated to an interest expense of 4m before taxation and minority interests 2008 6m.
iii Foreign currency risk The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
The group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e above.
Transaction risk Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
The groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance.
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12 month basis.
The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: sugar prices in British Sugar UK and Poland to movements in the sterling euro and Polish zloty euro exchange rates respectively: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.

The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses.
A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The following assumption has been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests: the exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see below for a separate sensitivity.

Financial instruments continued g Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or instrument.
The groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 12 September 2009.
The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2009 2008 m m Cash and cash equivalents 391 348 Loans and receivables refer to note 25a 1,161 1,067 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss other current investments 9 derivative financial assets 5 3 Designated cash flow hedging relationships derivative financial assets 7 51 1,564 1,478 The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
As at 12 September 2009, there were no significant financial guarantees or third-party obligations that increased the credit risk of the financial assets set out above.
Although the group has seen no direct evidence of changes to the credit risk of its counterparties, the current focus on financial liquidity in all international markets has introduced increased financial volatility.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
The group has established a credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
Credit limits are established for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
Customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim.
The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.
The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.

Financial instruments continued The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was: 2009 2008 m m UK 330 407 Europe & Africa 251 181 The Americas 141 169 Asia Pacific 299 235 1,021 992 Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2009 2008 gross gross m m Not overdue 638 659 Up to 1 month past due 186 122 Between 1 and 2 months past due 31 34 Between 2 and 3 months past due 8 18 More than 3 months past due 31 37 Provision for doubtful debts 38 43 At 12 September 2009 856 827 The trade receivables shown above include 9m trade receivables that are classified as held for sale at year end.
Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables that are not past due.
Trade and other receivables are stated net of the following provision for irrecoverable amounts: 2009 2008 m m Opening balance 43 34 Amounts provided for during the year 8 11 Amounts released during the year 2 1 Amounts utilised during the year 12 3 Acquisitions disposals 1 1 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 Closing balance 38 43 No trade and other receivables 2008 none were written off directly to the income statement in the year.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.
Cash, cash equivalents and other current investments Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury.
The group has not recorded impairments against cash, cash equivalents or other current investments, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss, for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.

Financial instruments continued h Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained.
Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the groups borrowing facilities are given in section i.
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and compares them to carrying amounts: 2009 Due between Due within 6 months Due between Due between Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 19 1,224 24 1,248 1,248 Secured redeemable debenture stock 18 8 8 16 182 214 150 Secured bank loans 18 24 25 63 42 154 144 Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 18 503 62 37 345 314 1,261 1,083 Finance lease liabilities 26 1 1 2 41 45 13 Provisions 20 198 50 33 108 52 441 421 derivative financial liabilities Currency derivatives net payments 95 9 104 56 Commodity derivatives net payments 23 50 1 72 19 Interest rate derivatives net payments 1 1 1 total financial liabilities 2,031 128 151 679 407 3,396 3,135 2008 Due between Due within 6 months Due between Due between Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 19 1,181 53 1,234 1,234 Secured redeemable debenture stock 18 8 8 16 198 230 150 Secured bank loans 18 17 7 60 53 137 137 Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 18 243 10 3 470 121 847 847 Finance lease liabilities 26 1 1 3 42 47 14 Provisions 20 32 43 14 84 1 174 174 derivative financial liabilities Currency derivatives net payments 3 9 1 13 10 Commodity derivatives net payments 7 14 7 28 14 Interest rate derivatives net payments 3 3 1 5 1 total financial liabilities 1,481 119 87 808 164 2,659 2,581 The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at 12 September 2009.
The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on the secured redeemable debenture stock and other fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the groups finance leases, and cash flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

The undrawn committed facilities available at 12 September 2009 in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met amounted to 840m 2008 219m : 2009 2008 Facility Drawn Undrawn Facility Drawn Undrawn m m m m m m US$1.2bn syndicated facility 719 211 508 671 469 202 US private placement 378 378 320m syndicated facility 320 320 British Sugar secured redeemable debenture stock 150 150 150 150 European Investment Bank 120 120 120 120 Zambia sugar facilities 77 77 101 101 Other 83 71 12 65 48 17 1,847 1,007 840 1,107 888 219 Uncommitted facilities available at 12 September 2009 were: 2009 2008 Facility Drawn Undrawn Facility Drawn Undrawn m m m m m m Money market lines 80 80 160 28 132 Illovo facilities 203 113 90 186 63 123 China banking facilities 295 138 157 Other 275 119 156 238 155 83 853 370 483 584 246 338 In addition to the above facilities there are also 67m 2008 93m of undrawn and available credit lines for the purposes of issuing letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business.
The group also has 13m 2008 14m of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are included in the groups interest-bearing loans and overdrafts in note 18.
In October 2008, the Company negotiated a three-year 320m committed facility with its existing banking group that when added to the existing US$1.2bn of committed bank facilities provide 1,039m of bank finance.
Both these facilities mature in October 2011.
In addition to the bank debt, in March 2009 the Company issued 378m of private placement notes to institutional investors in the US and Europe.
At 12 September 2009, these have an average remaining duration of 6.2 years and an average fixed coupon of 7.1%.
The other significant core committed debt facilities comprise a 150m debenture loan and a 120m EIB loan which mature in 2013 and 2015 respectively.
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn at any time.
Refer to note 9 for details of the groups capital commitments and to note 27 for a summary of the groups guarantees.
An assessment of the groups current liquidity position is given in the Financial review section of the annual report on page 25.
The uncommitted total facility of 853m in the table above differs from the uncommitted credit lines referred to in the Financial review by 12m.
This relates to the net amount of uncleared receipts, recognised in bank overdrafts.

Financial instruments continued j Capital management The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet.
Note 21 provides details on equity and note 18 on loans and overdrafts.
Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities.
Longer term funding is sourced from a combination of these facilities, the private placement notes and committed syndicated loan facilities.
The boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable successful future development of the business.
The board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level of dividends payable to shareholders.
From time to time the group purchases its own shares in the market.
The shares are purchased to satisfy awards under the groups share option scheme and long-term incentive plan.
Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market.
The group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes to the groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Lease commitments Operating leases The group acts as a lessee, lessor and sub-lessor both for land and buildings and plant & machinery under operating leases.
Sublease receipts of 2m 2008 3m were recognised in the income statement in the period, the majority relating to operating leases.
The total of future minimum sublease receipts expected to be received is 34m 2008 29m.
Under the terms of the lease agreements, no contingent rents are payable.
The future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Within one year 100 87 Between one and five years 333 308 After five years 1,224 1,130 1,657 1,525 Finance leases Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: 2009 2008 minimum minimum lease 2009 2009 lease 2008 2008 payments interest principal payments interest principal m m m m m m Within one year 1 1 1 1 Between one and five years 3 2 1 4 3 1 After five years 41 29 12 42 30 12 45 32 13 47 33 14 102 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 27.
Contingencies Litigation and other proceedings against companies in the group are not considered material in the context of these financial statements.
The group has not adopted the amendments to IAS 39 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other group companies, the group considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such in accordance with IFRS 4.
In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the relevant group company issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
As at 12 September 2009, group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to 597m 2008 196m.
Related parties The group has a controlling related party relationship with its parent company, which is also its ultimate parent company see note 30.

Accounting estimates and judgements Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the accounting policies detailed on pages 58 to 63, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from the groups operations which, in some circumstances, are discounted to arrive at a net present value: the carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually and also when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
This assessment involves comparing the book value of goodwill with its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate.
Both the projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty: and the realisation of deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise.
The group recognises deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered, based on an assessment of the likelihood of there being sufficient taxable profits in the future.
Post-retirement benefits The groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which has been assessed using assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in an asset of 16m and a liability of 122m being recognised as at 12 September 2009.
The size of these assets and liabilities is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes, to the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, to the actuarial assumptions which include price inflation, rates of pension and salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions and to the level of contributions.
Further details are included in note 12.
Provisions As described in the accounting policies on pages 58 to 63, provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are made taking into account a range of possible outcomes.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2009 105 Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the year ended 12 September 2009 31.
Accounting estimates and judgements continued Property, plant & equipment residual values and useful lives These assets are written down to their estimated residual values over their anticipated useful lives using the straight-line basis.
Management reviews residual values annually considering market conditions and projected disposal values.
In assessing useful lives, maintenance programmes and technological innovations are considered.
The carrying value of property, plant & equipment is disclosed in note 9.
Biological assets Cane roots valuation the escalated average cost of planting cane roots is adjusted for the remaining expected life.
This requires an estimation by management of the average number of ratoons expected from the crop.
The carrying value of cane roots is disclosed in note 10.
Growing cane valuation growing cane is valued using the estimated sucrose content at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport.
The estimated sucrose content requires management to assess the expected cane and sucrose yields for the following season considering weather conditions and harvesting programmes.
In assessing the estimated sucrose price, management is required to assess into which markets the forthcoming crop will be sold and assess domestic and export prices as well as the related foreign currency exchange rates.
The carrying value of growing cane is disclosed in note 10.
Cash flow hedge accounting The group enters into various types of hedging or forward contracts for the buying and selling of currencies and commodities.
The contracts often fall within the scope of IAS 39 and accordingly have to be marked to market.
Where appropriate, these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, which allows, to the extent the hedges are effective, the change in values of the derivatives to be deferred in equity.
In order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for the group to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and whether the hedge is effective.
This requires both subjective and objective measures of determination.
Exceptional items The directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their nature and amount should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to fairly present the financial position and financial performance of the entity.
The directors label these items collectively as exceptional items.
Determining which transactions are to be considered exceptional in nature is often a subjective matter.
However, circumstances that the directors believe would give rise to exceptional items for separate disclosure might include major business restructurings, impairments and reversals of impairments.
All exceptional items are included in the appropriate income statement line item to which they relate.
In addition, for clarity, separate disclosure is made of all exceptional items in one column on the face of the income statement, with additional explanation in the notes.
Taxation The income tax expense recorded in the income statement is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, unless new tax rates have been enacted or substantively enacted.
The level of current and deferred tax recognised is also dependent on subjective judgements as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the group operates.
It is necessary to consider the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised based on an assessment of the extent to which they are regarded as recoverable.
Fair values on acquisition The group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value.
Items of plant and equipment and the associated property interests often have long operating lives, hence determination of the fair values can require a significant degree of judgement.
Acquisitions often also result in significant intangible benefits being brought into the group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets.
Other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of accounting standards and form part of goodwill.
Significant judgement can be required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, often with reference to internal data and models.
Professional valuers are engaged where it is deemed appropriate to do so.
Fair values on major acquisitions are disclosed in note 22.

They are prepared under the historical cost convention, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards UK GAAP and the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by s408 4 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included in these financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 1, no cash flow statement for the Company has been included on the grounds that the group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 8, no related party disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries have been included.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, not to prepare a note to the financial statements relating to financial instruments as the information is available in the published financial statements of the group.
Intangible assets goodwill Intangible assets consist of goodwill arising on acquisitions since 17 September 1998, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration of businesses over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised in accordance with FRS 10 and amortised over its useful life, not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are reported at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial instruments All financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs, and thereafter at amortised cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Company operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
The principal defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme and the Company is unable to identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Hence, contributions to this scheme are accounted for as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme.
The Company has one small unfunded defined benefit scheme which it accounts for in accordance with FRS 17 using the advice of professional actuaries.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members during the year.
It also includes a charge equal to the expected interest on plan liabilities over the year.
The present value of plan liabilities is disclosed as a liability on the balance sheet net of any related deferred tax.
Share-based payments The Share Incentive Plan allows employees of the Company to receive allocations of shares to be distributed subject to attainment of certain financial performance criteria and typically after a three-year performance period.
The fair value of the shares to be awarded is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The fair value of the shares allocated is measured taking into account the terms and conditions under which the shares were allocated.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest.
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as for allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The Share Option Scheme 1994 and Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 allow executives to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Shares in the Company are held in a separate trust and are shown at cost as a deduction in arriving at equity shareholders funds.
New accounting policies Amendment to FRS 8 Related party disclosures effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 6 April 2008.
The amendment to FRS 8 eliminates the disclosure exemption for transactions with subsidiaries that are 90% owned or more.
The disclosure exemption is still applicable to wholly owned subsidiaries.
The amendment requires the disclosure of corresponding amounts, where applicable.
