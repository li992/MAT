The Company has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee as adopted by the European Union, relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2008.

Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on pages 12 to 23 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes in the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Operating and Financial Review.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2010 and projections contained in the longer term business plan.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment, the shortage of credit available in the bank finance market in particular and the other principal risks to the Groups performance.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
