The recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.

This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
In the United Kingdom, an increase in the discount factor of 1.4% and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of 1.8% would eliminate any headroom under each scenario.
There are no other CGUs that are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
