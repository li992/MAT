Capital management The capital of HMV Group plc is the total equity on the Groups balance sheet.
The objective of the Groups capital management is to grow its retailing business and deliver improving returns for its shareholders.
The management of the Groups capital is performed by the Board of Directors, taking into account economic conditions and strategic requirements.
The Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
During the year, 20,168,524 new shares were issued to raise funds for strategic initiatives, as discussed on page 17.
No changes were made to dividend policy, which is currently to declare two payments each year, one at the Half Year of approximately 25% of the total expected dividend and the second at the Full Year paid in October.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share option plan The Company has a number of share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Companys Ordinary Shares have been granted to certain Directors and management, details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 32.
Options were granted at the five-day average of the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The options can normally only be exercised after three years and are subject to the achievement of earnings per share targets imposed at the date of grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests or before vested options are exercised.
