Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence unrealised profits in respect of such securities, currently included within the unrealised capital reserve, may be regarded as distributable under company law.
This technical interpretation of the meaning of distributable reserves would, as a consequence, give rise at 31 January 2009 to capital reserves available for distribution of approximately 251,118,540 after adjusting unrealised capital losses of 134,498,602.

The Company may therefore only distribute, by way of dividend, accumulated amounts credited to the Revenue Reserve.
