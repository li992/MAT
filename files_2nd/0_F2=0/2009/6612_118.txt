Provisions are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the final outcome and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of provision is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the provisions are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes: by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid defined benefit schemes also include defined contribution sections.

In certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds reflects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
An equity risk premium of between 3% and 4% is added to longer term government bond yields to give the expected rate of return on equities.
Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the PCA00 standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort i. e. improvements at recently observed higher levels which are assumed to continue to 2020 with minimum improvements thereafter of 1% per year for males and 0.5% for females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2029 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.3 28.2 24.5 26.2 Projected for 2029 29.6 29.5 26.4 27.3 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
Following an asset liability study in 2007, the Group decided to adopt a strategy to reduce gradually the allocation of investment in equities.
During 2009, it was agreed that the pace of reallocation would be increased primarily through investment of the deficit reduction contributions in bonds.
The target allocation of equities and property in the US scheme has been reduced to 50% of the total.
In the UK the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham defined benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
The Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the defined benefit liabilities: UK USA Rest of World 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 4.60 3.90 4.25 4.50 4.50 5.00 3.00 3.10 3.25 Discount rate 5.70 6.20 5.75 5.75 6.00 6.00 4.70 5.00 4.75 Expected pension increases 3.60 2.90 3.25 n a n a n a 2.20 2.10 2.00 Cash balance credit conversion rate n a n a n a 4.75 4.50 4.75 1.60 1.20 1.60 Inflation rate 3.60 2.70 3.25 2.50 2.50 2.50 1.70 1.70 1.75 GSK Annual Report 2009 130 Notes to the financial statements 28 Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three years ended 31st December 2009 in relation to the defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were as follows: Post-retirement Pensions benefits UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2009 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 121 66 64 251 35 Past service cost 6 6 27 Expected return on pension scheme assets 347 121 46 514 Interest on scheme liabilities 378 148 62 588 74 Settlements and curtailments 54 7 17 44 8 206 94 63 363 90 Actuarial losses gains recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 578 5 77 660 1 Post-retirement Pensions benefits UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2008 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 126 61 59 246 30 Past service cost 10 2 12 4 Expected return on pension scheme assets 442 144 47 633 Interest on scheme liabilities 377 121 53 551 62 Settlements and curtailments 175 12 22 165 22 236 60 45 341 118 Actuarial losses gains recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 776 576 82 1,434 64 Post-retirement Pensions benefits UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2007 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 138 60 57 255 30 Past service cost 7 1 6 Expected return on pension scheme assets 389 141 37 567 Interest on scheme liabilities 335 107 41 483 54 Settlements and curtailments 24 5 6 23 6 108 24 56 188 90 Actuarial losses gains recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 523 66 43 632 39 The total actuarial losses recorded in the statement of comprehensive income since 1st January 2003 amount to 2,047 million.

The liability for the US post-retirement healthcare scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical inflation of 8.5% 2008 9.0%, reducing by 0.5% per year to 5% in 2017 and thereafter.
During 2007, the US post-retirement healthcare scheme was amended.
The main change was an increase in the cap on Group costs.
During 2009, both the US pension and post-retirement healthcare plan were amended.
The changes resulted in a one-off gain of 37 million in the income statement.
At 31st December 2009 the US plan obligation was 1,102 million 2008 1,223 million: 2007 879 million.
However, in accordance with IAS 19 the unvested part of a benefit improvement is not recognised immediately on the balance sheet but is recognised gradually through the income statement.
At 31st December 2009, the unrecognised amount of 40 million 2008 51 million: 2007 47 million primarily relates to the effect of this change in the US post-retirement scheme.
At 31st December 2008, the past service cost not recognised from this scheme amounted to 53 million.

During 2009, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK pension schemes totalling 332 million and 95 million to the US scheme 2008 200 million to the UK pension schemes.
In 2009, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identified at the 31st December 2008 actuarial funding valuation.
The additional contributions are expected to be 365 million per year for 2010 to 2013.
The contributions are based on a discount rate of 5.25% and an inflation assumption of 2.8%.
The next review of contribution levels is expected to be at the 31st December 2011 actuarial valuation although the Group has agreed to review mortality assumptions before then which could result in an earlier revision to contributions.
Employer contributions for 2010, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 800 million in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and 60 million in respect of post-retirement benefits.
