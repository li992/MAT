Risk Management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to achieve its investment objective as stated on page 17.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the revenue available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close cooperation with the Board of Directors coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, and the methods used to manage these risks, that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 19 ii, interest rate risk see note 19 iii and market price risk see note 19 iv.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
ii Currency risk A proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency, and that in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
At 31 December 2009, the value of non-sterling denominated investments amounted to 888,490,000 2008: 415,686,000.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Foreign currency borrowing and forward currency contracts are used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued ii Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 December 2009 are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, the principals have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall exposure.

48 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for sterling US dollar, sterling Canadian dollar, sterling Australian dollar and sterling Rand.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US dollar -8% 2008: 25% Sterling Canadian dollar -5% 2008: 10% Sterling Australian dollar -4% 2008: 10% Sterling Rand -2% 2008: 5% These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If sterling had weakened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 US Canadian Australian US Canadian Australian dollar dollar dollar Rand dollar dollar dollar Rand 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 8% 5% 4% 2% 25% 10% 10% 5% Impact on revenue return 503 102 56 5 3,554 142 319 229 Impact on capital return 28,592 8,315 4,949 2,205 54,881 4,440 5,500 3,468 Total return after tax effect on shareholders funds 29,095 8,213 4,893 2,200 58,435 4,582 5,819 3,697 If sterling had strengthened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 US Canadian Australian US Canadian Australian dollar dollar dollar Rand dollar dollar dollar Rand 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 8% 5% 4% 2% 25% 10% 10% 5% Impact on revenue return 429 93 52 5 2,132 116 261 207 Impact on capital return 24,356 7,523 4,568 2,118 32,929 3,633 4,500 3,138 Total return after tax effect on shareholders funds 24,785 7,430 4,516 2,113 35,061 3,749 4,761 3,345 Annual Report and Accounts 31 December 2009 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk movements may affect the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan facility.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment 2009 2008 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Bank loans 24,194 24,194 Bank overdrafts 17,799 17,799 3,104 3,104 41,993 41,993 3,104 3,104 Includes interest payable to maturity.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates change.
The Companys exposure to interest rates is limited to the multi-currency borrowing facilities detailed above as the majority of financial assets are equity shares which do not pay interest.
Therefore, the Companys total income and equity is not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
Interest receivable, and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances or paid on bank overdrafts and loans respectively, is approximately 0.53% and 1.25% per annum 2008: 4.32% and 5.43% per annum.
50 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc iv Market price risk Market price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the investments.
The Companys investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Investment Managers compliance with the Companys objective, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company manages its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity or commodity investments in its portfolio.
The Companys exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December 2009 on its quoted and unquoted equity or commodity investments and options on indices and investments was 1,221,734,000 2008: 581,978,000.
Concentration of exposure to market price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 13 to 15.
At 31 December 2009, this shows that the portfolio had significant levels of investments in Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The following illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity to an increase or decrease of 20% in the fair values of the Companys equities including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions in 2009.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2009 is a decrease of 3,177,000 2008: 1,048,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 244,347,000 2008: 116,340,000.
The impact of a 20% decrease in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2009 is an increase of 3,177,000 2008: 1,048,000 and on the capital return is a decrease of 244,347,000 2008: 116,340,000.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Balance Sheet at their fair value investment and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued iv Market price risk continued Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss At 31 December 2009 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 000 000 000 000 Equities 1,107,045 1,094,768 3,361 8,916 Fixed interest securities 114,689 52,764 61,925 Total 1,221,734 1,147,532 3,361 70,841 Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 2 h. There were no transfers during the year between Level 1 and Level 2.
A reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.
Level 3 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss At 31 December 2009 000 Opening fair value 2,724 Purchases at cost 68,446 Sales proceeds 132 Total gains or losses included in gains on investments in the Income Statement: on sold assets 631 on assets held at the end of the year 434 Closing fair value 70,841 Level 3 valuations comprise investments held at Directors valuation as disclosed on pages 13 and 14.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 2 h. 52 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc v Liquidity and credit risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity and credit risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has an overdraft facility of 30 million 2008: 40 million and a multicurrency loan facility of 70 million 2008: 60 million.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain 75% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Companys assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity and credit risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: Not more 3 months than one More than or less year one year Total 2009 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 41,950 41,950 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 4,230 4,230 46,180 46,180 2008 Current liabilities: Bank overdrafts 3,104 3,104 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 2,227 479 2,706 5,331 479 5,810 The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to determine the risk to the Company of default: transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement or on an over the counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk mitigation criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the credit worthiness of financial institutions with whom cash is held or loan facilities are arranged is reviewed regularly by the Investment Manager: Annual Report and Accounts 31 December 2009 53
