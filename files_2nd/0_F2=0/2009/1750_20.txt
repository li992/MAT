Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company are disclosed below: Basis of accounting The Companys financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and in compliance with the Companies Act 1985.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
Taxation Current UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Bank and Borrowings Having reassessed the substance of the companys borrowing arrangements, the long term loan facility terminating in June 2012 has been classed in creditors due after one year.
The 2008 balance has been changed to reflect the move from creditors due within one year.
