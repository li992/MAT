Warning to shareholders We are aware that some shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
Such operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA has reported that the average amount lost by each investor is around 20,000.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved by visiting www.
Report the matter to the FSA.
For UK callers telephone 0300 500 5000 and for overseas callers telephone 44 20 7066 1000 or visit www.
If the calls persist, hang up.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
