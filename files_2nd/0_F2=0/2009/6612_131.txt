We use an interest rate swap to redenominate one of our external borrowings into the interest rate coupon required by GSK.
The duration of this swap matches the duration of the principal instrument.
Interest rate derivative instruments are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges of the relevant assets or liabilities.
Foreign exchange risk management Foreign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade flows are not hedged.
The exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
For this purpose, our internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage intercompany payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk.
Exceptional foreign currency cash flows are hedged selectively under the management of Corporate Treasury.
We manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency.
We seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets and cash flows.
These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling.
Certain borrowings are swapped into other currencies as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets.
Forward contracts are also used in major currencies to reduce our exposure to our investment in overseas Group assets see Net investment hedges section of this note for further details.
The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies monthly.
Credit risk The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 13,434 million 2008 13,265 million which is the total of the Groups financial assets with the exception of Other investments which do not bear credit risk.
See page 155 for details on the Groups total financial assets.
GSKs greatest concentration of credit risk is 1.3 billion 2008 1.9 billion invested in US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds which bear credit exposure to the US Government.
Treasury-related credit risk In 2009, credit risk remained high during the global credit crisis.
GSK has continued to maintain its conservative approach to counterparty risk throughout this period.
A report on relationship banks and their credit ratings is presented annually to the TMG for approval.
The aggregate credit risk in respect of financial instruments the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moodys and Standard and Poors.
The table below sets out the credit ratings of counterparties for liquid investments, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives.
The gross asset position on each derivative contract is considered for the purpose of this table, though, under the ISDA contracts, the amount at risk is the net asset position with each counterparty.

Where the opinion of the two rating agencies differ, GSK assigns the lower rating of the two to the counterparty.
Where local rating agency data is the only source available, the ratings are converted to global ratings equivalent to those of Moodys Investor Services or Standard and Poors using published conversion tables.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments excluding obligations under finance leases and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt and which do not present a material exposure.
These three currencies are the major foreign currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies over the last three years and has concluded that a 20% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Intercompany loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have been excluded from this analysis.
2009 2008 Increase decrease Reduction Increase decrease Reduction in income in equity in income in equity m m m m 20% appreciation of the US dollar 251 755 210 991 20% appreciation of the Euro 8 1,779 20 1,760 20% appreciation of the Yen 45 1 52 A 20% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movements in the income statement relate primarily to hedging instruments for US dollar legal provisions, and to trade payables and trade receivables.
Whilst the hedging instruments provide economic hedges, the related provisions are not financial instruments and therefore are not included in the table above.
The combined sensitivity of these hedging instruments and the provisions would be insignificant if the provisions were included.
The movements in equity relate to foreign exchange positions used to hedge Group assets denominated in US dollar, Euro and Yen.
Therefore, a depreciation on the currency swap would give rise to a corresponding appreciation on the Group asset.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets other than financial instruments is not included above.

GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 2% increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate for this calculation.
A 2% movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2009 2008 Increase decrease Increase decrease in income in income m m 2% increase in Sterling interest rates 2 16 2% increase in US dollar interest rates 38 13 2% increase in Euro interest rates 18 4 These interest rates could not be decreased by 2% as they are currently less than 1.0%.
The maximum increase decrease in income would therefore be limited to 1 million, 4 million and 2 million for Sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates respectively 2008 16 million, 1 million and 4 million.
Interest rate movements on obligations under finance leases, foreign currency derivatives, trade payables, trade receivables and other financial instruments not in net debt do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet based on a 2% increase or decrease in these interest rates.
Contractual cash flows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following is an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31st December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31st December.
