114 Financial Statements Explanation of transition to reporting in US Dollars INTRODUCTION Following a period of sustained international growth, the Groups cash flows and economic returns are now principally denominated in US Dollars.
Accordingly, on 28 October 2009, BG Group announced that from financial year 2010 it will be changing the currency in which it reports its financial results to US Dollars.
To assist shareholders during this change, comparative financial information for the years ended 31 December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 is re-presented in US Dollars below.
BASIS OF PREPARATION Presentation of financial information BG Group will present its results in US Dollars with effect from 1 January 2010.
For the years ended 31 December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Company has presented a condensed consolidated income statement and a condensed consolidated cash flow statement, along with a condensed consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 on pages 115 to 116.
This financial information will form the basis of the comparative financial information expected to be included in the first complete set of financial statements of the Group presented in US Dollars for the year ended 31 December 2010.
In order to meet the IAS 21 requirements with respect to a change in presentational currency, the statutory financial information as initially reported in the Groups Annual Reports for the years ended 31 December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 on pages 125 to 126 has been restated from Pounds Sterling into US Dollars using the procedures as outlined below: assets and liabilities denominated in non-US Dollar currencies were translated into US Dollars at closing rates of exchange.
Non-US Dollar trading results were translated into US Dollars at average rates of exchange.
Differences resulting from the retranslation of the opening net assets and the results for the year have been taken to reserves: the cumulative translation reserve was set to nil at 1 January 2003 i. e. the transition date to IFRS.
All subsequent movements comprising differences on the retranslation of the opening net assets of non-US Dollar subsidiaries have been charged to the translation reserve.
Share capital, share premium and other reserves were translated at the historic rates prevailing at the dates of transactions: and all exchange rates used were extracted from the Groups underlying financial records.
The exchange rates used are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2006 US$ UK exchange rate Closing rate 1.6149 1.4378 1.9906 1.9572 Average rate 1.5510 1.8934 2.0029 1.8282 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008 2007 2006 Business Business Business Business Total Results Performance a Total Results Performance a Total Results Performance a Total Results Performance a Revenue and other operating income $m 16 170 16 009 24 151 23 885 16 339 16 694 14 046 13 280 Total operating profit $m 6 296 6 490 10 448 10 227 6 193 6 511 6 121 5 651 Basic earnings per share $ 0.99 1.04 1.78 1.74 1.03 1.06 0.93 0.86 a Business Performance excludes disposals, certain re-measurements and impairments as exclusion of these items provides readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
