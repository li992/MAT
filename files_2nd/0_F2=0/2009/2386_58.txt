BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes on financial statements 3.
Disposals and impairment continued Impairment In assessing whether a write-down is required in the carrying value of a potentially impaired intangible asset, item of property, plant and equipment or an equity-accounted investment, the assets carrying value is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Unless indicated otherwise, the recoverable amount used in assessing the impairment charges described below is value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
This discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted where applicable to take into account any specific risks relating to the country where the cash generating unit is located, although other rates may be used if appropriate to the specific circumstances.
The rate applied in each country is re-assessed each year.
In certain circumstances the fair value less costs to sell may be available for an asset.
On occasion, an impairment assessment may be carried out using fair value less costs to sell as the recoverable amount when, for example, a recent market transaction for a similar asset has taken place.
For impairments of available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted investments, the fair value is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business at the balance sheet date.
Any cumulative loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.
Exploration and Production During 2009, the Exploration and Production segment recognized impairment losses of $118 million.
The main elements were the write-down of our $42 million investment in the East Shmidt interest in Russia, triggered by a decision to not proceed to development: a $62 million charge associated with our nErgize gas scheduling system: and several other individually insignificant impairment charges amounting to $14 million.
During 2008, the Exploration and Production segment recognized impairment losses of $1,186 million.
The main elements were the write-down of our investment in Rosneft by $517 million, to its fair value determined by reference to an active market, due to a significant decline in the market value of the investment see Note 25, impairment of oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico of $270 million triggered by downward revisions of reserves, an impairment of exploration assets in Vietnam of $210 million following BPs decision to withdraw from activities in the area concerned, impaiment of oil and gas properties in Egypt of $85 million triggered by cost increases, and several other individually insignificant impairment charges amounting to $104 million.
These charges were partly offset by reversals of previously recognized impairment losses amounting to $155 million.
Of this total, $122 million resulted from a reassessment of the economics of Rhourde El Baguel in Algeria.
During 2007, the Exploration and Production segment recognized impairment losses of $292 million.
The main elements were a charge of $112 million relating to the cancellation of the DF1 project in Scotland, a $103 million partner loan write-off as a result of unsuccessful drilling in the West Shmidt licence block in Sakhalin and a $52 million write-off of the Whitney Canyon gas plant in US Lower 48 driven by managements decision to abandon this facility.
In addition, there were several individually insignificant impairment charges, triggered by downward reserves revisions, amounting to $25 million in total.
These charges were largely offset by reversals of previously recognized impairment charges amounting to $237 million.
Of this total, $208 million resulted from a reassessment of the decommissioning liability for damaged platforms in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf.
The remaining $29 million related to other individually insignificant impairment reversals, resulting from favourable revisions to the estimates used in determining the assets recoverable amounts.
Refining and Marketing During 2009, an impairment loss of $1,579 million was recognized against the goodwill allocated to the US West Coast fuels value chain FVC.
The goodwill was originally recognized at the time of the ARCO acquisition in 2000.
The prevailing weak refining environment, together with a review of future margin expectations in the FVC, has led to a reduction in the expected future cash flows.
Further information, including details of the groups approach to impairment reviews of goodwill, is given in Note 8.
Other impairment losses were also recognized by the segment on a number of assets which amounted to $255 million.
During 2008, the Refining and Marketing segment recognized impairment losses on a number of assets which amounted to $159 million.
The main component of the 2007 impairment charge of $1,186 million arose because of a decision to sell our company-owned and companyoperated sites in the US resulting in a $610 million write-down of the carrying amount of the sites to fair value less costs to sell.
Following a decision to sell certain assets at our Acetyls plant in Hull, UK, we wrote down the carrying amount of these assets to fair value less costs to sell leading to an impairment charge of $186 million.
Changing marketing conditions led to impairments in Samsung Petrochemical Company, to fair value less costs to sell, and in China American Petrochemical Company amounting to $165 million.
The balance relates principally to the write-downs of assets elsewhere in the segment portfolio.
Other businesses and corporate During 2009 and 2008, Other businesses and corporate recognized impairment losses totalling $189 million and $227 million respectively related to various assets in the Alternative Energy business.
The impairment loss of $83 million in 2007 related to various individually insignificant write-downs.
Segmental analysis The groups organizational structure reflects the different activities in which BP is engaged.
In 2009, BP had two reportable segments: Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing.
BPs activities in low-carbon energy are managed through our Alternative Energy business, which is reported in Other businesses and corporate.
The group is managed on an integrated basis.
Exploration and Productions activities cover three key areas.
Upstream activities include oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production.
Midstream activities include pipeline, transportation and processing activities related to our upstream activities.
Marketing and trading activities include the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas LNG, together with power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
Refining and Marketings activities include the supply and trading, refining, manufacturing, marketing and transportation of crude oil, petroleum and petrochemicals products and related services.

Segmental analysis continued Other businesses and corporate comprises the Alternative Energy business, Shipping, the groups aluminium asset, Treasury which in the segmental analysis includes all of the groups cash, cash equivalents and associated interest income, and corporate activities worldwide.
The Alternative Energy business is an operating segment that has been aggregated with the other activities within Other businesses and corporate as it does not meet the materiality thresholds for separate segment reporting.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in Note 1.
However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.
For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit a before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit inventory holding gains and losses.
Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized GAAP measure.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Sales to external customers are based on the location of the seller.
The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of Refining and Marketing.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate.
However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the other operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for BP, and for the UK as this is BPs country of domicile.

Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on the historic cost of acquisition or manufacture rather than the current replacement cost.
In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income.
The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement on a FIFO basis and any related movements in net realizable value provisions and the charge that would arise using average cost of supplies incurred during the period.
For this purpose, average cost of supplies incurred during the period is calculated by dividing the total cost of inventory purchased in the period by the number of barrels acquired.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss.
No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.
