The carrying value of the Gray & Osbourn Limited brand name has been determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for this calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent two year financial budgets approved by management and thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity with no growth assumed to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which cash flows are expected to be generated.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.4%.

Trade receivables that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience.
The carrying amount of trade receivables whose terms have been renegotiated but would otherwise be past due totalled 51.0m at 28 February 2009 2008, 40.0m.
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every 28 days.

Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
All customer receivables are unsecured.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2.
Financial risk management objectives The financial risks facing the group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The group seeks to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed by the groups policies.
The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency risk management The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

Where appropriate, exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit before tax for the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2009 would decrease by 1.1m 2008, 1.0m.
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
62 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group Accounts 20 Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating agencies.
Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and did not exceed five percent of gross monetary assets at any one time during the period.
Liquidity risk management The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 18 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal and details of the groups remaining contractual maturity for its nonderivative financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of 1.8m and 1.7m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2009 and 2008 respectively.
68 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group Accounts 33 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 0.6m 2008, 0.6m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 28 February 2009, contributions of 0.1m 2008, 0.1m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30 June 2006 by an independent qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the groups net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2009 2008 Discount rate 6.7% 6.1% Expected return on scheme assets 5.4% 5.8% Expected rate of salary increase 4.9% 5.1% Future pension increases 2.3% 2.4% Inflation 3.4% 3.6% Life expectancy at age 65 years Pensioner aged 65 21.2 21.2 Non-pensioner aged 45 22.3 22.3 2009 2008 Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: m m Current service cost 1.8 2.3 Interest cost 3.5 3.2 Expected return on scheme assets 3.1 2.7 2.2 2.8 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The cumulative actuarial gains since transition to IFRS were 9.6m 2008, 11.3m.
The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of 8.6m 2008, loss of 0.8m.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase.
