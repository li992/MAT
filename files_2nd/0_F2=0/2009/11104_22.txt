As this exceeded carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised 2008: nil.
Next Sourcing The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of Next Sourcing to efficiently meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four 2008: four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 8.0% 2008: 6.0%.
In the year ended January 2009, Next Sourcing generated an operating profit before interest of 32.0m 2008: 32.8m.
Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the five year business plan for Lipsy was used and cash flows beyond this period extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%, and discounted at 15.0%.
The key assumption in the calculation is the growth in internet sales.
A 10% annual shortfall in the projected growth in the first five years would reduce the recoverable amount to a value equal to its carrying amount.
Eastern European owned stores The key assumptions in the calculation are the number of retail stores and like for like sales growth.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 12.0%.

The company is involved in the wholesale and retail of womens fashion in the UK and overseas.
Cash consideration of 14.1m was paid at the date of acquisition, and further consideration is payable in 2012, 2013 and 2014 contingent on the performance of the company.
The present value of this contingent consideration has been estimated at 1.5m.

Shares held by ESOT The Next 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT has an independent professional trustee resident in Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at the discretion of the Trustee.
At 24 January 2009 the ESOT held 4,076,763 2008: 4,587,161 ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the market value of which amounted to 44.7m 2008: 63.1m.
Details of outstanding share options are shown in Note 28.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 24 January 2009 and 26 January 2008 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the Group.
All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the Company and the Group.
Financial instruments: risk management Next operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts, loans and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.

Financial instruments: risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

75.0m of the 2010 facility was drawn down at 24 January 2009 2008: 205.0 of the 2009 facility.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.

Financial instruments: risk management continued Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for but does not demand that these exposures are hedged for up to 18 months ahead in order to fix the cost in sterling.
This hedging activity involves the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange derivatives is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas assets or liabilities and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are detailed in the table below.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 34.

Concentrations of risk are mitigated by the use of a number of different counterparties at any one time.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 15.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 35, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in Note 27.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering long term sustainable growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buy backs in addition to dividends.
Share buy backs are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.

Financial instruments: hedging activities Foreign currency: cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of overseas sourced products during the next twelve months.
These derivatives comprise forward currency contracts and currency options, the terms of which match the terms of the expected purchases.

Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same critical terms as the bond, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest of 5.25% and pays a variable rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 21.
Interest rates: cash flow hedges At 24 January 2009 the Group had other interest rate derivatives in place as cash flow hedges in respect of the Groups variable rate debt.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group pays a fixed rate of interest between 1.74% and 4.89% and receives a variable rate 6 month LIBOR.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 14.1 12.3 Derivatives in designated cash flow hedging relationships 2.4 Total interest rate derivatives 11.7 12.3 The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis continued Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US dollar 1.37 2008: 1.98 and Euro 1.06 2008: 1.35.
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 1.0% represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change as at 24 January 2009.
The disclosures as at 26 January 2008 were based on a movement of 0.5% change in interest rates, being the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change at that date.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

The Group has entered into operating leases in respect of vehicles, equipment, warehouses, office equipment and retail stores.
These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between 3 months and 23 years.
Contingent rentals are payable on certain retail store leases based on store revenues.
The majority of the Groups operating leases provide for their renewal by mutual agreement at the expiry of the lease term.
