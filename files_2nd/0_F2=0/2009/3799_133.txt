After netting off balances within countries, the following are the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet: 2009 2008 Net deferred tax balance m m Deferred tax assets 300 256 Deferred tax liabilities 11 24 Net deferred tax asset liability 289 232 Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences amount to 67 million 2008: 56 million.
Of the total, tax losses of 21 million will expire at various dates between 2010 and 2018.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
As a result of changes to tax legislation, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 will be largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
The un-remitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is 174 million 2008: 2,616 million as calculated under the previous rules prior to the change in legislation.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that this will not take place in the foreseeable future.
