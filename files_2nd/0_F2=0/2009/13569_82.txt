Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 131 18 Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
For the UK defined benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service.
Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, updated by the scheme actuaries to December 31, 2009.
The most recent funding valuations of the main UK schemes were: Scheme Valuation date Rolls-Royce Pension Fund RRPF March 31, 2009 Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme April 5, 2007 Vickers Group Pension Scheme March 31, 2007 Restatement IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction has been adopted in 2009.
The interpretation requires that, where statutory funding requirements will result in an unrecognisable surplus arising in the future, a liability should be recognised.
The rules of the RRPF are such that future contributions set out in the schemes Recovery Plan will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus.
In accordance with the transition rules of the interpretation, it has been applied from January 1, 2008, and the 2008 figures have been restated accordingly.

This is a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 36m 2008 38m in the year.

The discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
For the main UK schemes, the rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
For less significant UK schemes and overseas schemes, the rate is determined as the market yield at the average duration of the forecast benefit payments.
The discount rates above are the weighted average of those for each scheme, based on the value of their respective liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual returns expected from each asset class see below in accordance with the actual asset balance in the schemes investment portfolios.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the actuarial tables PA92, other than RRPF which has adopted the SAPS tables in its 2009 valuation, with 80 per cent of long cohort, published by the Institute of Actuaries, projected forward and, where appropriate, adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
The resulting range of life expectancies in the principal UK schemes are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 Current pensioner 19.6 years to 23.5 years Future pensioner 20.7 years to 24.2 years Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2009 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 133 18 Post-retirement benefits continued The future costs of healthcare benefits are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of eight per cent grading down to five per cent over six years.
Other demographic assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the schemes.
Assumptions in respect of overseas schemes are also set in accordance with advice from local actuaries.

The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rate of return for LDI portfolios is determined by the implicit yield on the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
The expected rates of return on other individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to gilt yields.
In the UK, equities and corporate bonds are assumed to generate returns that exceed the return from gilts by 3.25 per cent and 1.0 per cent per annum respectively.
The expected rates of return above are the weighted average of the rates for each scheme.
Future contributions The Group expects to contribute approximately 270m to its defined benefit schemes in 2010.
