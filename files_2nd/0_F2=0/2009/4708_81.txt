The assets of the UK and Irish pension plans are held in separate funds administered by trustees to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans benefi ciaries.
The two largest pension plans are the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom and the Guinness Ireland Pension Scheme in Ireland.
For the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, the trustee is Diageo Pension Trust Limited.
The appointment of the directors to the board is determined by the Schemes trust documentation.
There is a policy that one-third of all directors should be nominated by members of the Scheme.
Two member nominated directors have been appointed from the pensioner member community and two from the active member community.
For the Guinness Ireland Pension Scheme, the appointment of trustees is a company decision.
Currently the company makes three nominations and appoints three further candidates nominated by representative groupings.
The chairman is a former employee of the company and is viewed as independent.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benefi ts in respect of medical costs.
These plans are generally unfunded.
In addition, there are a number of other plans which provide post employment benefi ts other than pensions and medical benefi ts.
These plans are also included in the fi gures presented below.
a The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups defi cit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

The 2009 assumption for medical infl ation in the United States reduces by 0.5% per year to 5% 2008 0.5% per year to 5%.
In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom the largest plan is based on the mortality experience of that plan.
This has been updated to refl ect the mortality experience analysis carried out as part of the 2009 triennial funding valuation which is in progress.
The assumption is based on the SAPS birth year tables with scaling factors based on the experience of the plan.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the long cohort with a proportion of 80% for males and 60% for females.
The mortality assumption for the largest plan in Ireland is also based on the mortality experience of that plan with suitable future improvements.
The mortality assumptions for the other plans around the world are based on relevant standard mortality tables and standard mortality improvements in each country.

The expected long term rate of return on other assets in the UK plans was adjusted to refl ect this.
of the consolidated Post employment benefi t assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether an individual fi financial statements plan is in surplus or defi cit, as follows: 98 Consolidated income statement 2009 2008 99 Consolidated million million statement of Non-current assets 41 47 recognised income Non-current liabilities 1,424 455 and expense 1,383 408 100 Consolidated balance sheet 101 Consolidated cash The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the fl ow statement countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2009, to refl ect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of 102 Accounting policies return on equities include a risk premium of 4% per year 2008 and 2007 3.25% per year in excess of the expected return from government of the group bonds.
This risk premium is a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other 106 N otes to the FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, by using an appropriate risk consolidated premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
fi financial statements 149 Independent auditors The investment strategy for the groups funded post employment plans is decided locally by the trustee of the plan and or Diageo, as report to the members appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of of Diageo plc in respect return in excess of the return on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is of the parent company implemented by using specifi c allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
fi financial statements Most investment strategies have signifi cant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the 150 Company post employment plans being lower over the long term, and will be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also balance sheet designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual stock exposures.

fi financial statements The discount rate is based on the yields of high quality, fi xed income investments.
For the UK pension plans, which represent 155 Principal group approximately 66% of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is determined by reference to the yield curves on AA rated corporate bonds for companies which the timing and amount of cash outfl ows are similar to those of the plans.
A similar process is used to determine the discount rate for the non-UK plans.

For these purposes, the value of the defi cit, calculated using the trustees actuarial valuation of the Scheme, was ascertained through the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2006.
Following the completion of that valuation, Diageo undertook to make an annual 50 million cash contribution in each of the four years of the funding plan.
The fi first payment of 50 million was made in the year ended 30 June 2007, with further contributions of 50 million in each of the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009.
Payments are made into an escrow account subject to an agreement between the group and the trustee, with release from escrow either to the group or to the trustee determined by an agreed formula in the light of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2009.
It is anticipated that the escrow will be released to the trustee and invested into the Scheme during the year ending 30 June 2010.
This amount held in escrow is currently included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet and is not included in the table above, but if the escrow is released to the trustee, then it will be shown as a contribution by the group to the Scheme during the year ending 30 June 2010.
In addition to the defi cit funding, Diageo continues to make a cash contribution in respect of current service cost based on the trustees valuation: this contribution is expected to be 46 million in the year ending 30 June 2010.
Total cash contributions to the Scheme during the year ending 30 June 2010 are therefore expected to amount to 240 million, of which 144 million is already recorded in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2009.
Funding arrangements are being reviewed and may be adjusted following agreement between Diageo and the trustee, based on the results of the valuation as at 31 March 2009.
Additionally, funding arrangements will be reviewed and adjusted in the light of future triennial actuarial valuations.
Contributions to other plans in the year ending 30 June 2010 are expected to be approximately 125 million.
