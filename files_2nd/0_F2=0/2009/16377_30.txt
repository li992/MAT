The reconciliation between the computed weighted average rate of income tax expense, which is generally applicable to Unilever companies, and the actual rate of taxation charged is as follows: % %% Reconciliation of effective tax rate 2009 2008 2007 b Computed rate of tax 29 30 29 Differences due to: Incentive tax credits 6 5 6 Withholding tax on dividends 2 22 Adjustments to previous years 3 2 5 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1 12 Other 3 Effective tax rate 26 26 22 b The computed tax rate used is the average of the standard rate of tax applicable in the countries in which Unilever operates, weighted by the amount of profit before taxation generated in each of those countries.
For this reason the rate may vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates.

9 Goodwill and intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
Brands that are classied as indefinite have been in the market for many years, and the nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years.
The level of amortisation for nitelived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next five years.

Impairments charge in the year There were no material impairments in 2009.
The impairments charged in 2008 principally related to a non-core savoury business in the Americas which was subsequently classied as held for sale.
significant CGUs The goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets predominantly Knorr and Hellmanns held in the regional Savoury and Dressings CGUs are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at 31 December 2009.
No other CGUs are considered significant in this respect.
The goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets held in the regional Savoury and Dressings CGUs are: billion billion billion billion 2009 2009 2008 2008  lived Goodwill intangibles Goodwill intangibles Western Europe 5.2 1.3 5.1 1.3 The Americas 3.9 1.3 3.6 1.3 AAC 1.9 0.6 1.9 0.5 During 2009, we conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets.
Value in use in the regional Savoury and Dressings CGUs has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash ows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% was used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow projections for the regional Savoury and Dressings CGUs: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 2% to 3% for Western Europe, 5% for the Americas and 9% to 10% for AAC: average near-term nominal growth rates for the major product groups within the CGUs of 2% Western Europe, 4.5% The Americas, 9% for AAC: and average operating margins for the major product groups within the CGUs ranging from 16% to 20% Western Europe, 19% to 20% The Americas and 10% to 12% AAC.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
We believe that the assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the regional Savoury and Dressings CGUs are consistent with past performance.
The projections covered a period of ten years as we believe this to be a suitable timescale over which to review and consider annual performance before applying a xed terminal value multiple to the final year cash ows of the detailed projection.
Stopping the detailed projections after five years and applying a terminal value multiple thereafter would not result in a value in use that would cause impairment.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average rates of growth for similar products.
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the regional Savoury and Dressings CGUs to be less than the carrying amount.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.
Other receivables comprise loans and receivables of 221 million 2008: 258 million and other non-financial assets of 422 million 2008: 397 million.
We do not consider the fair values of trade and other receivables to be signicantly different from their carrying values.
Balances are considered for impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 103 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management Uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets: impact on Treasury We believe our strong single-A rating and active financial management have served us well in the current financial uncertainty.
Maintaining our strong single-A rating has been and will remain a key priority.
To cope with the volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, we undertook, amongst others, the following actions: Liquidity management: During 2009 we issued four bonds at competitive rates for a total of 2.2 billion to take advantage of historically low long term interest rates: As a result, we have been able to keep commercial paper at a low level, issuing at significant discounts to Libor, when needed: and As the business successfully managed working capital positions throughout the year, Unilever closed the year with a cash and cash equivalents balance of around 2.6 billion.
Counterparty exposures: We regularly reviewed and tightened counterparty limits.
Banking exposures were actively monitored on a daily basis.
During the year most of our deposits remained on an overnight basis providing maximum exibility.
Unilever benets from collateral agreements with our principal banks see also page 106 based on which banks need to deposit securities and or cash as collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Unilever did not encounter any material counterparty exposure loss from financial institutions during 2009.
Funding costs: Throughout the year, in general, credit spreads have decreased signicantly but remain volatile.
During 2009 we were able to issue commercial paper and bonds at competitive rates, with a very good reception by the markets.
Bank facility renewal: Our bank facilities are renewed annually.
On 31 December 2009 we had US $6,050 million of undrawn committed facilities.
For further details, see Liquidity risk' section below.
Treasury risk management Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and counterparty risks.
Currency risks Because of Unilevers broad operational reach, it is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values that could affect earnings.
As a practical matter, it is not feasible to fully hedge these uctuations.
Unilever does have a foreign exchange policy that requires operating companies to manage trading and financial foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits.
This is achieved primarily through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
On a case-by-case basis, depending on potential income statement volatility that can be caused by the fair value movement of the derivative, companies decide whether or not to apply cash ow hedge accounting.
Regional groups monitor compliance with this foreign exchange policy.
At the end of 2009, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign currencies but publishes its financial statements and measures its performance in euros, it is subject to exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
Unilever aims to minimise its foreign exchange exposure in operating companies by borrowing in the local currency, except where inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local market conditions.
For those countries that in the view of management have a substantial retranslation risk, Unilever may decide on a case-by-case basis, taking into account amongst other factors the impact on the income statement, to hedge such net investments.
This is achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts on which hedge accounting is applied.
Nevertheless, from time to time, currency revaluations on unhedged investments will trigger exchange translation movements in the balance sheet.
Interest rate risks Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at achieving an optimal balance between xed and oating rate interest rate exposures on expected net debt gross borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents.
The objective of the policy is to minimise annual interest costs and to reduce volatility.
This is achieved by issuing xed rate long-term debt and by modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps.
The xing levels for the next five years are managed within agreed xing bands, with minimum and maximum xing level percentages, decreasing by 10 percentage points per calendar year.
The minimum level is set to avoid unacceptable interest cost volatility and the maximum level is set to prevent over-xing, recognising that future debt levels can be volatile.
At the end of 2009, interest rates were xed on approximately 95% of the projected net of cash and financial liability positions for 2010, slightly higher than 90%, the upper limit of the band due to the good cash delivery from the business and 75% for 2011 compared with 56% for 2009 and 51% for 2010 at the end of 2008.
104 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Liquidity risk A material and sustained shortfall in our cash ow could undermine our credit rating and overall investor confidence and could restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
Operational cash ow provides the funds to service the nancing of financial liabilities and enhance shareholder return.
Unilever manages the liquidity requirements by the use of short-term and long-term cash ow forecasts.
Unilever maintains access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support its commercial paper programmes and for general corporate purposes.
During 2009 we did not utilise the committed facilities.
Unilever had US $6,050 million of undrawn committed facilities on 31 December 2009 as follows: revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $5,285 million 2008: US $4,230million out of which US $5,285 million 2008: US $3,675 million with a 364-day term out: and 364-day bilateral money market commitments of in aggregate US $765 million 2008: US $1,775 million, under which the underwriting banks agree, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for notes with maturities of up to three years.
Revolving 364-day notes commitments of US $200 million at 31 December 2008 were converted during 2009 into the revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities, and were therefore nil at 31 December 2009.
As part of the regular annual process these facilities will be renewed in 2010.

Credit risk on banks and received collateral Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with banks like cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
To reduce the credit risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited group of banks that have secure credit ratings.
Per bank, individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
To reduce the credit exposures, netting agreements are in place with Unilevers principal banks that allow Unilever, in case of a default, to net assets and liabilities across transactions.
To further reduce Unilevers credit exposures, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal banks based on which they need to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2009 the collateral received by Unilever amounted to 208 million 2008: 369 million, of which 14 million was cash and the fair value of the bond securities amounted to 194 million.
Although contractually Unilever has the right to sell or repledge the collateral, it has no intention to do so.
As a consequence, the non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in our balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Boards, covering the use of derivative financial instruments.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes.
The Group has an established system of control in place covering all financial instruments: including policies, guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting, that is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
Hedge accounting principles are described in note 1 on page 84.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk element on the underlying hedged item has been excluded.
The Group uses the following types of hedges: cash ow hedges used to hedge the risk on future foreign currency cash ows, oating interest rate cash ows, and the price risk on future purchases of raw materials: fair value hedges used to convert the xed interest rate on financial liabilities into a oating interest rate: net investment hedges used to hedge the investment value of our foreign subsidiaries: and natural hedges used to hedge the risk on exposures that are on the balance sheet.
No hedge accounting is applied.
Details of the various types of hedges are given below.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts at the year-end forward exchange rates.
The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows.
106 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Cash ow hedges The fair values of derivatives hedging the risk on future foreign currency cash ows, oating interest rate cash ows and the price risk on future purchases of raw materials amount to 10 million 2008: 14 million of which 7 million relates to commodity contracts 2008: 21 million, 19 million to foreign exchange contracts 2008: 7 million and 2 million to interest rate derivatives 2008: nil.
Of the total fair value of 10 million, 12 million is due within one year 2008: 14 million.
The following table shows the amounts of cash ows that are designated as hedged items in the cash ow hedge relations: million million million million million million million Due Due Due Due Due Due within between between between between after 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total 2009 Foreign exchange cash inows 797 797 Foreign exchange cash outows 304 304 Interest rate cash ows 9 9 9 17 44 Commodity contracts cash ows 125 125 2008 Foreign exchange cash inows Foreign exchange cash outows 200 200 Interest rate cash ows Commodity contracts cash ows 121 121 Fair Value hedges The fair values of derivatives hedging the fair value interest rate risk on xed rate debt at 31 December 2009 amounted to 92 million 2008: 68 million which is included under other financial assets.

The impact of exchange rate movements on the fair value of forward exchange contracts used to hedge net investments is recognised in reserves.
Natural hedges A natural hedge sometimes known as an economic hedge is where exposure to a risk is offset, or partly offset, by an opposite exposure to that same risk.
Hedge accounting is not applied to these relationships.
The following table shows the fair value of derivatives outstanding at year end that are natural hedges.

Sensitivity to not applying hedge accounting Derivatives have to be reported at fair value.
Those derivatives used for cash ow hedging and net investment hedging for which we do not apply hedge accounting will cause volatility in the income statement.
Such derivatives did not have a material impact on the 2009 income statement.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement', Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet specic requirements set out in the standard: no material embedded derivatives have been identied.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.
All trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency proles in note 14 on pages 102 to 103, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value, because of their short-term nature.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair value of unquoted available-for-sale assets is based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates and statistical modelling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.
The fair values and the carrying amounts of all other listed investments included in financial assets and preference shares included in financial liabilities are based on their market values.
The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value.
Non-listed bonds and other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties.
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity forward contracts.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.
In the balance sheet the value of bonds and other loans is shown at amortised cost unless the bonds are part of an effective fair value hedge accounting relationship, in which case the value of the bond is adjusted with the market value of the related derivative.
108 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Fair value hierarchy Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments at fair value.
The amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.

All commodity forward contracts and futures hedge future purchases of raw materials.
Settlement of these contracts will be in cash or by physical delivery.
Those contracts that will be settled in cash are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and, to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under IAS 39, fair value movements are recognised in the cash ow reserve.
Capital management The Groups financial strategy supports Unilevers aim to be in the top third of a reference group including 20 other international consumer goods companies for Total Shareholder Return, as explained on page 46.
The key elements of the financial strategy are: appropriate access to equity and debt markets: sufficient exibility for acquisitions that we fund out of current cash ows: A A1 long-term credit rating: A1 P1 short-term credit rating: sufficient resilience against economic and financial turmoil: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints above.
For the A1 P1 short-term credit rating Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 109 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued The capital structure of Unilever is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Unilever will take appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, the capital structure.
Annually the overall funding plan is presented to the Board for approval.
Return on Invested Capital continues to be one of Unilever's key performance measures.
Within this denition we have dened the components of our Invested Capital.
See page 45 for the details of this denition and the calculation of Unilever's Return on Invested Capital.
Unilever is not subject to covenants in any of its significant nancing agreements.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates The values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities holding them, are subject to exchange rate movements.
The translation risk on the foreign exchange receivables and payables is excluded from this sensitivity analysis as the risk is considered to be immaterial because positions will remain within prescribed limits see currency risks on page 104.
The remaining unhedged foreign exchange positions at 31 December 2009 amount to 2 million 2008: 45 million.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a 0.2 million movement in the income statement 2008: 5 million, based on a linear calculation of our exposure.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in interest rate Interest rate risks are presented by way of sensitivity analysis.
As described on page 104, Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility in the income statement.
As part of this policy, part of the financial assets and financial liabilities have xed interest rates and are no longer exposed to changes in the oating rates.
The remaining oating part of our financial assets and financial liabilities see interest rate prole tables on pages 102 for the assets and 103 for the liabilities is exposed to changes in the oating interest rates.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the income statement to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in oating interest rates on a full-year basis.
Sensitivity to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in oating rates as at 31 December million million 2009 2008 Financial assets 92 77 Financial liabilities 91 105 Net investment hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in foreign exchange rates To reduce the retranslation risk of Unilever's investments in foreign subsidiaries, Unilever uses net investment hedges.
The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements and changes in these fair values are recognised directly in equity and will offset the retranslation impact of the related subsidiary.
At 31 December 2009 the nominal value of these net investment hedges amounts to 4.9 billion 2008: 5.1 billion mainly consisting of US$ contracts.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a fair value movement of 486 million 2008: 513 million.
This movement would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the book equity of the foreign subsidiary.
Cash ow hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates Unilever uses on a limited scale both interest rate and forex cash ow hedges.
The fair values of these instruments are subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Because of the limited use of these instruments and the amount of Unilever's equity, possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates will not lead to fair value movements that will have a material impact on Unilever's equity.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,283 million and tax credits amounting to 32 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1,006 million and tax credits of 32 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 412 million of state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2029.
Other deductible temporary differences of 110 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,319 million 2008: 967 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Legal provisions are comprised of many claims, of which none is individually material.
Further information is given in note 25 on page 122.
The provision for disputed indirect taxes is comprised of a number of small disputed items.
The largest elements of the provision relate to disputes with the Brazilian authorities.
Because of the nature of the disputes, the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, and any associated cash outows, is uncertain.
The majority of the disputed items attract an interest charge.
For further information please refer to note 25 on page 122.
No individual item within the other provisions balance is significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved over the next five years.
112 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 19 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Exposure to risks Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 14,413 million and 16,995 million respectively are held on the Groups balance sheet as at 31 December 2009.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates, ination and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in these schemes, and could prompt the need for the Group to make additional pension contributions, or to reduce pension contributions, in the future.
The key assumptions used to value our pension liabilities are set out below and on pages 114 and 115.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The pension funds also have a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds, hedge funds and cash.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplied externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and hedge funds.
The aim is to provide a high quality, well-diversied, risk-controlled vehicle.
Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit plans which cover approximately 95% of total pension liabilities and the plans providing other post-employment benets, and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point 1% point increase decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 1 1 Effect on total benefit obligation 17 16 The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The assumptions made in 2009 are consistent with those applied in 2008.
Mortality assumptions for the most important countries are based on the following post-retirement mortality tables: i United Kingdom: PNMA 00 and PNFA 00 with medium cohort adjustment subject to a minimum annual improvement of 1% and scaling factors of 110% for current male pensioners, 125% for current female pensioners and 105% for future male and female pensioners: ii the Netherlands: GBMV 2000-2005 with age set back of four years for males and two years for females: iii United States: RP2000 with a projection period of 10-15 years: and iv Germany: Heubeck 1998 Periodentafel with a scaling factor of 85%.
These tables translate into the following years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65: United United Kingdom Netherlands States Germany Males 21 21 19 18 Females 23 22 22 21 With regard to future improvements in life expectancy, in the UK for example, males and females currently aged 45 are assumed to have a life expectancy of 24 years and 26 years respectively on retirement at age 65.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 115 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 19 Pensions and similar obligations continued Liabilities of 150 million were transferred from the UK unfunded plan to the funded plan in 2009.
This followed the payment to the UK funded plan in 2008 in expectation of a transfer in 2009 and 2010.
During 2008 some previously unfunded liabilities were funded utilising existing surpluses.
As a consequence of this the liabilities of 24 million were moved from unfunded to funded in the table above for 2008.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 37 million 0.3% of total plan assets and 25 million 0.2% of total plan assets at 31 December 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 12 million and 57 million at 31 December 2009 and 2008 respectively.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benets Trust amounting to 127 million 2008: 146 million to fund pension and similar obligations in the US see also note 11 on page 97.

In 2009, the benets paid in respect of unfunded plans amounted to 234 million 2008: 223 million: 2007: 280 million.
Company contributions to funded dened benefit plans are subject to periodic review, taking account of local legislation.
In 2009, contributions to funded dened benefit plans amounted to 968 million 2008: 531 million: 2007: 878 million.
2009 contributions paid to funded plans included around 370 million of future years contributions accelerated into 2009.
2008 contributions to funded plans included 254 million to the UK pension plan to cover the transfer of unfunded liabilities into the plan in 2009 and 2010.
In 2009 and 2007, refunds of 25 million 50 million respectively were received out of recognised surplus from Finland.
In 2008 a 42 million refund was received from the Danish pension plan following action to externally insure the liabilities.
Contributions to dened contribution plans including 401k plans amounted to 60 million 2008: 55 million: 2007 52 million.
Total contributions by the Group to funded plans, net of refunds, are currently expected to be about 425 million in 2010 2009 actual: 968 million.
benefit payments by the Group in respect of unfunded plans are currently expected to be about 215 million in 2010 2009 actual: 234 million.

c As part of the review of Unilever's corporate structure, and in the light of the constitutional and operational arrangements which enable Unilever N. V. and Unilever PLC to operate as nearly as practicable as a single company, the Directors have been authorised to take any action necessary or desirable in order to ensure that the ratio of the dividend generating capacity of PLC to that of NV does not differ substantially from the ratio of the dividend entitlement of ordinary shareholders in PLC to that of ordinary shareholders in NV.
In 2008 shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland were transferred to 100% NV ownership.
In addition, shareholdings in Canada and Indonesia were re-aligned between NV and PLC.
In 2007 and 2009 there were no significant changes in group structure.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 was 5,199 million for NV and 2,063 million for PLC.

Future minimum sublease payments of 66 million are expected to be received.
Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services.
They do not include commitments for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 95.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benets, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benets.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.
The Group does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will result in a material loss.
Contingent liabilities arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and scal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2009 was some 205 million 2008: 355 million.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2009 121 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Legal proceedings Details of significant outstanding legal proceedings and ongoing regulatory investigations are as follows: Competition investigations As previously reported, in June 2008 the European Commission initiated an investigation into potential competition law infringements in the European Union in relation to consumer detergents.
Unilever has received a number of requests for information from the European Commission regarding the investigation and has been subject to unannounced investigations at some of its premises.
The investigation is ongoing although no statement of objections against Unilever has been issued to date.
It is too early to reliably assess the ultimate resolution or to estimate the fines which the Commission will seek to impose on Unilever as a result of this investigation.
Therefore no provision has been made.
However, substantial fines can be levied as a result of European Commission investigations.
Fines imposed in other sectors for violations of competition rules have amounted to hundreds of millions of euros.
In December 2009, Unilever received separate statements of objection from the French competition authority and from the Italian competition authority in connection with investigations into certain product markets in France and Italy respectively.
An earlier decision by the Greek authority ning Unilever in relation to alleged restrictions on parallel trade within certain of its contracts with retailers in Greece is under appeal.
Appropriate provisions have been made in relation to these investigations and the ning decision.
In addition and as previously reported, Unilever is involved in a number of other ongoing investigations by national competition authorities.
These include investigations in Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands.
These investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets.
In several cases it is not clear that the authorities will seek to impose a ne on Unilever, and in others it is too early to be able reasonably to assess the level of fines which the authorities may seek to impose.
It is Unilevers policy to co-operate fully with the competition authorities in the context of all ongoing investigations.
In addition, Unilever reinforces and enhances its internal competition law compliance procedures on an ongoing basis.
Tax cases Brazil During 2004 the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil local acronym STF announced a review of certain cases that it had previously decided in favour of taxpayers.
Because of this action, we established a provision in 2004 for the potential repayment of sales tax credits in the event that the cases establishing precedents in our favour are reversed.
Since that time we continue to monitor the situation and have made changes as appropriate to the amount provided.
In June 2007, the Supreme Court ruled against the taxpayers in one of these cases.
Industry associations of which Unilever is a member attempted to negotiate a settlement with the Federal Revenue Service to reduce or avoid the payment of interest and or penalties on such amounts.
On 3 December 2008 the negotiations resulted in the publication of a settlement by the Brazilian government, open to all taxpayers including Unilever.
This settlement was ratied by the President of Brazil in 2009 and was subsequently supported by further legislation which increased the discount on the interest payable.
Unilever made a payment on October 29th, 2009 to settle the claim and this matter is now resolved.
Also during 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The dispute is in court and if upheld, will result in a tax payment relating to years from 2001 to the present day.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
We believe that the likelihood of a successful challenge by the tax authorities is remote.
While this view is supported by the opinion of outside counsel there can be no guarantee of success in court.

At the same time we acquired the soap business of Cosmivoire, a subsidiary of SIFCA.
On 23 December 2008 we completed the disposal of our Bertolli olive oil and vinegar business to Grupo SOS for a consideration of 630 million.
The transaction was structured as a worldwide perpetual licence by Unilever of the Bertolli brand in respect of olive oil and premium vinegar.

With effect from 1 October 2007, Unilever and Remgro Ltd. reached agreement to reorganise their respective shareholdings in the Unilever businesses in South Africa and Israel.
In the reorganised shareholding Unilever has a majority share in a single South African business and fully owns the Unilever Israel foods and home and personal care business.
As a result of this transaction, Unilever reported a profit on disposal of 214 million and goodwill of 168 million.
On 1 January 2007, Unilever completed the restructuring of its Portuguese businesses.

The combined business includes the foods and home and personal care businesses.
The remaining 45% interest is held by Jernimo Martins Group.
The structure of the agreement is such that there is joint control of the newly formed entity and so it is accounted for by Unilever as a joint venture.

29 Share-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2009, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
Starting in 2007, performance share awards and restricted stock awards were made under the Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP, except in North America where awards were made under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 73 and those for key management personnel shown in note 4 on page 90.
No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2007, 2008 or 2009 under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using option pricing models and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
