b Principal accounting policies The policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the year.
i Financial instruments Financial Instruments include fixed asset investments, derivative assets and liabilities, and long-term debt instruments.
Accounting Standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for Financial Instruments which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classification of Instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Included within this category are investments listed on any recognised stock exchange or quoted on the AIM Market in the UK.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such Instruments would be those for which the quoted price has been suspended, forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
The Company held no such securities during the year under review.
Level 3 External inputs are unobservable.
Value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar Instrument.
Included in Level 3 are investments in private companies or securities, whether invested in directly or through pooled Private Equity vehicles.
