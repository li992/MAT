Loss earnings per share The calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year end.
Shares held by the ESOP, which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted loss per share is based on the basic loss per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed exercise of all dilutive options.
The loss earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
Reconciliations of the loss earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.
