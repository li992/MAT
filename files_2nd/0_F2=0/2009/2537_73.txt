The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings which they hedge and are considered to be effective.
Covenants on these Notes include a term which states that Britvic plc must offer to repay the Notes should a change in control of the group occur which results in a credit rating downwards as defined in the Note purchase agreement.
