yields began to stabilise and then contract over the second half of 2009, taking the average yield to 6.7% at 31 December 2009.
The rental growth performance was an important factor in partially offsetting the outward movement of yields over the year, leading to relative outperformance against other types of real estate.
Over the full year, UNITEs portfolio fell in value by an average of 1%, compared to a fall for the broader sector of 5.6%, as measured by IPD.
