Value in use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long term growth rate of the sector served by the CGUs.
The key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each CGU, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 26 April 2009 were as follows: Retail and Brands with the exception of Everlast Annual sales growth for the first five years of between 5% and 6% depending on the constituent elements of the CGU, followed by terminal sales growth of 2%.
Gross margin of between 30% and 47% depending on the constituent elements of the CGU.
Annual maintenance expenditure of between Nil and 1.0m per annum depending on the individual entitys circumstances.
Discount rates are estimated at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.4%.
everlast Annual sales growth of 10% for the first 5 years followed by terminal sales growth of 5%, reflecting specific plans for the business.
Gross margin and capital expenditure within the Retail and Brands range.
Discount rates are estimated at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 12.8%.
The key assumptions are based on managements historical experience and future plans for each CGU.
With the exception of Everlast, a reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For Everlast the reasonably possible changes in assumptions would have the following impact: Reducing the risk specific discount rate of 12.8% to the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 9.4% would result in no impairment and the value of goodwill would exceed its carrying value by 126m.
Changing the risk specific discount rate by 1% would result in a change of valuation of 19m.
A change of 1% in the forcasted terminal growth rate would result in a change of valuation of 14m.
The intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
An impairment charge of 14,832,000 was recognised, mainly due to an increase in discount rates to reflect specific risk factors and a decrease in forecast sales growth as a result of the tough economic climate.
