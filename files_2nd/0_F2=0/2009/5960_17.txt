Fidessa group plc 44 Notes to the financial statements Fidessa group plc Fidessa or the Company, is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 12th February 2010.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
The Group's business activities and position in its market are described in the Overview and Market Review.
The directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertainties as far as the global economy is concerned.
The Group has considerable financial resources, no borrowings, a high level of recurring revenue and a very broad spread of customers.
As a consequence of these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the coming year, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Both the Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
In publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
1 Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of financial instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The following standards have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements: IFRS8 Operating Segments the standard replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and aligns operating segments reported to those segments reported internally to senior management.
The standard had no impact on the Groups result or financial position, only impacting on disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.
Revised IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements the revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
In addition, the standard requires the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in a single statement or two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present two statements.
Amendment to IFRS2 Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations the amendment clarifies the definition of vesting conditions.
The amendment had no impact of the Group's result or financial position.
Amendment to IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments the amendment requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results for which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised in note 25.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group and Company to all periods presented in these financial statements.

3 Significant accounting policies a Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Fidessa group plc and its subsidiaries.
There are no associates or joint ventures to be included in the consolidated accounts.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain the benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date on which control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
b Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the translation of the Groups net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the translation reserve.
On disposal of a foreign entity the cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Fidessa group plc 46 Notes to the financial statements continued c Revenue Revenue represents the amount chargeable, excluding sales related taxes, for software and related services supplied.
Revenue is only recognised where there is persuasive evidence that a contract exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
Full allowance is made for all known or expected losses.
Revenue from rental, application hosting and support services is recognised equally over the period that the service is to be provided.
Revenue from installation, consultancy and training services chargeable on a time and materials basis is recognised when the work is performed.
Revenue from fixed price implementations is recognised over the period of implementation in accordance with the estimated percentage completed for each contract, based on the anticipated number of days of effort for the implementation.
Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for goods and services not yet supplied.
Accrued revenue represents amounts recognised as revenue to be invoiced in a future period.
d Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share incentive plans.
The fair value of the incentives granted is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the incentives granted is measured using a binomial model or a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the incentives were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share incentives that vest except where forfeiture is only due to the share price not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
e Post employment benefits Certain subsidiaries operate defined contribution pension schemes for their employees.
Pension costs are charged to the income statement as they arise.
f Interest receivable Interest receivable on interest-bearing financial assets is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate used reflects the anticipated cash flows to be received.
g Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47 h Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided by the Group to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Equipment and furniture 35 years Computers 23 years Motor vehicles 4 years Buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements 510 years or remainder of lease if shorter i Intangible assets Research and development Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on product development relating to the design, programming and testing of new or enhanced products are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development will provide economic benefits, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, resources are available for the development, and costs can be measured reliably.
The expenditure capitalised is the direct labour cost and is managed and controlled centrally.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Product development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Product development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the time of development on a straight-line basis over three years.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups interest in the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Acquisition intangibles Intangible assets acquired from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition and amortised over their estimated useful economic life.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships 10 years Complete technology 3 years Brands and other marketing related 3 years Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are purchased by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Software purchased for internal use is amortised over two years.
Fidessa group plc 48 Notes to the financial statements continued j Impairment of assets Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are no larger than an operating segment for the purposes of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates is estimated and the carrying amount is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of assets other than goodwill and deferred tax are reviewed for impairment only when events indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use for the Group.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash generating units or assets value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit or asset that have not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows.
k Leased assets Where the Group enters into an operating lease the rentals are charged as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
l Investments and financial instruments Investments in subsidiary companies, which are all unquoted equity investments, are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
A financial instrument is recognised if the Company or Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the Groups contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Groups obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
m Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost, their carrying value being reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
n Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
o Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
p Employee Benefit Trust and Share Bonus Trust The Employee Benefit Trust and Share Bonus Trust, which purchase and hold ordinary shares of the Company in connection with employee share schemes, are included in the Companys financial statements and presented as a deduction from equity.
Any consideration paid or received by the trusts for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 49 q Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
No provision is recognised for contingent liabilities if it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
4 Segment reporting The Market Review accompanying these annual financial statements reports on the marketplace that Fidessa addresses and therefore the sub-headings within that section of the report reflect the structure of the marketplace.
The segment reporting reflects the structure of the business operations which are focused on the method of delivery to the marketplace.
The business is structured into three business units: Enterprise, Hosted and LatentZero.
Shared and support services such as core product development, office costs and overhead functions, are controlled and monitored centrally.
The primary management and performance monitoring is undertaken by the Operating Board which comprises the heads of the business units and global functional heads.
The Enterprise business unit is focused on providing tailored solutions for large sell-side customers, packaging and integrating our products, services and consultancy and working with our customers to deliver a complete solution.
The Hosted business unit is focused on the software as a service SaaS delivery model allowing rapid deployment of complex workflow across a wide sell-side customer base.
The LatentZero business unit is focused on providing tailored solutions for large buy-side customers, packaging and integrating our products, services and consultancy and working with our customers to deliver a complete solution.
All segments leverage our products in the areas of connectivity and market data across our sell-side and buy-side customer base.
The Hosted business unit has responsibility for the provision of the connectivity and market data services.
The inter-business unit revenue relates to the provision of the connectivity and market data services and the provision of components of the hosted service for implementation to enterprise customers.
Revenue and direct costs are reported by business unit to present a profit contribution for each unit, such revenue and costs being measured and reported to the Operating Board.
The Operating Board monitors overall operating profit excluding amortisation of acquisition intangibles and product development capitalisation and amortisation, which is not an IFRS measure.
Finance income, finance costs, assets and liabilities are not reported by business unit.
No single external customer accounts for 10% or more of the Group revenue.
Recurring revenue reflects the periodic fees for software and related services that is charged on a rental or subscription basis.
Non-recurring revenue comprises the consultancy fees for implementation, configuration and ongoing support activity.

Patent dispute settlement in 2008 In June 2003 Fidessa noted an announcement released by Lava Trading Inc. now part of Citigroup that it had filed a patent infringement claim in the US against Fidessa.
The patent related to the concept of displaying prices from more than one source ECN on a single screen in the US.
In December 2003 Lava filed an amendment to its lawsuit alleging unfair trade practices on the part of Fidessa, in particular in relation to the pricing of products and associated services.
In December 2004 Fidessa announced that a Stipulated Judgement had been entered into the record in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which formally recorded that the patent had not been infringed.
Lava lodged an appeal and in April 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that the lower court did not correctly interpret all the technical terms in the patent and referred the case back to the lower court.
This meant that the patent proceedings, started in June 2003, were for the most part restarted from the beginning and all previous judgements no longer stood.
Both parties were therefore expecting further significant expenditure on litigation in order to progress the case.
On 30th July 2008 Fidessa announced that a settlement agreement had been reached with Lava under which Fidessa would provide Lava with products and services valued at $1.95 million over the following three years.
In return Lava would license Fidessa to use the inventions covered by the patent.
Both firms agreed to drop all claims and counter claims relating to this dispute.
The $1.95 million settlement was charged to the income statement in 2008.
The dispute had previously been treated as a contingent liability since due to the then uncertainty of the eventual outcome of the case, no provision was made in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 53 Lehman receivable write off in 2008 On 15th September 2008 Lehman Brothers International Europe appointed Administrators in the UK and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the US.
On 16th September 2008 Lehman Brothers Japan Inc commenced civil rehabilitation procedures under the Japan Civil Rehabilitation Law.
These entities together with certain of their subsidiaries together Lehman accounted for circa 2.0 million of revenue per annum and were a top ten customer.
The receivables from Lehman at these dates were unlikely to be recoverable and a 626,000 write off resulted in the income statement for the year ended 31st December 2008.

Fidessa group plc 56 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Goodwill Total LatentZero Hosted 000 000 000 Carrying value at 1st January 2008 47,129 41,474 5,655 Adjustment to deferred considerations in 2008 2,232 2,232 Carrying value at 1st January 2009 and at 31st December 2009 44,897 39,242 5,655 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating units which can be no larger than an operating segment.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of cash generating units.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue, operating margin and net operating cash flows.
These take into account past experience, both before and after the ownership by the Group, and the specific market trends for the particular product offerings.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of LatentZero results from the value of the assembled workforce, the synergistic nature of the acquisition due to the long-term cross-selling opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side clients, potential cost savings, the expected future growth and the acceleration of the Groups operations into the buy-side.
The LatentZero acquisition goodwill has been assigned to the LatentZero and Hosted business units.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the latest approved forecasts for the following year which have been extended for the following four years based on estimated growth rates of between 14% and 30% which management consider reflects a reasonable future rate for the cash generating units after considering recent growth rates, the increasing amount of recurring revenue, assessing the market opportunities and threats and the potential to expand the addressable market.
A declining rate of cash flow growth to 5% and a terminal growth of 2% has been assumed after the five year period as the expected useful life is materially greater than five years.
This is considered to reflect a cautious long-term average growth rate for the products and services.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the appropriate discount rate for each cash generating unit of 10% pre-tax 2008: 10%.
These have been calculated after assessing the specific risk premium for each cash generating unit, current gilt rates and the business's beta factor.
The recoverable amount for the LatentZero cash generating unit is sensitive to the improvement in operating margin that is achieved.
The value in use calculation assumes that a long-term operating margin of 11% is achieved and for this the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value by 21,000,000.
If the long-term operating margin should be only 7% then the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying value.

The estimated life for complete technology has been revised from five years to three years, this now being consistent with the estimated life for product development that the Group undertakes.
The estimated life for brands and marketing related assets has been revised from eight years to three years, reflecting the prevalence of the Fidessa brand as the synergistic opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side continue to develop.
The estimated life of customer relationships remains unchanged at ten years as no material change in this area has been detected.
The impact of these changes to estimated life is that the amortisation for the year has increased from 1,639,000 to 4,097,000 for complete technology and from 262,000 to 1,247,000 for brands and marketing.

The business subsequently changed its name to Touchpaper Group Limited Touchpaper.
Following the divestment, the Company held financial assets in Touchpaper comprising preference shares, ordinary shares, warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares and loan notes.
Since July 2001 the Company had no financial influence or operational involvement in the Touchpaper business and their results had not been consolidated into Fidessas performance.
In the year to 31st December 2007 Touchpaper had reported revenue of 17.5 million, profit before tax of 0.4 million and gross assets of 9.4 million under UK GAAP.
On 30th June 2008 Avocent Ireland Holdings Limited Avocent acquired the entire share capital of Touchpaper and the preference shares and loan notes were redeemed.
The Company recorded a gain in 2008 of 10,687,000 for the sale and redemption of the ordinary and preference shares, 1,900,000 for the redemption of the loan notes and 488,000 for the accrued interest on the loan notes.
The gain for the sale and redemption of the ordinary and preference shares included 550,000 held in escrow in respect of working capital at completion and an indemnities and general warranties retention.
During 2009 payment of 346,000 has been received in respect of the working capital escrow.
No further monies are due from this element of the escrow.
The retention for the indemnities and general warranties reaches the end of its term on 30th June 2010.
No observable market comparator is available to determine the fair value of this retention.
Therefore, the directors have determined its fair value by deducting from the potential maximum receivable the items known at the time of the sale that could lead to claims against the retention.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 59 During 2009 the directors became aware that one of the material issues that could have lead to a claim had been satisfactorily resolved.
Consequently, they have considered it appropriate to reassess the fair value of the amount still held in escrow.
As a result of this reassessment further income of 976,000 has been recognised in 2009.
The maximum additional future receipt possible from the indemnities and general warranties escrow is 3,352,000 of which 1,180,000 has been recognised as the fair value in other receivables.
The final amount received is dependent on the extent of any indemnity or warranty claims that materialise and professional fees incurred in processing such claims.
Any final payment is not expected until the second half of 2010 at the earliest.

All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
Cumulative translation adjustment The cumulative translation adjustment comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the Company to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree, must apply Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
When applicable, the section requires that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, the Company did not record a premium on the shares it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated balance sheet.
Dividends paid and proposed On 8th June 2009 the 2008 final dividend of 17.0 pence per share, 5,988,000, 2008: final dividend for 2007 of 12.0 pence per share, 4,149,000 was paid.
On 28th September 2009 an interim dividend of 10.0 pence per share, 3,543,000, 2008: 7.5 pence per share, 2,602,000 was paid.
A second interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31st December 2009 has been declared by the directors.
This is in place of a final dividend for 2009.
The second interim dividend will be 60.0p per share and comprises 20.0p per share as a replacement for a final dividend for 2009 and 40.0p per share as a special dividend.
The second interim dividend will be paid on 29th March 2010 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 5th March 2010, with an ex-dividend date of 3rd March 2010.
The dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

The deferred consideration was in two parts, being a payment in each of 2008 and 2009 based on performance in the respective prior year.
There are no further payments due for the acquisition.
21 Share-based payments A full description of each type of share-based payment to employees is in the Directors Remuneration Report.
All share incentives are over ordinary shares of the Company.
The Company grants share incentives to employees in the form of share options, share bonuses and under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan.
The fair value of incentives is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The employee expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting of the incentive.
For share options and share bonuses the fair value has been measured using a binomial model.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The material inputs into the model have been: Granted in Granted in Granted in Granted in Share options 2005 2006 2007 2009 Fair value 108.5p 190p 267p 276p Share price at grant 632p 860p 949p 1,154p Exercise price 632p 860p 949p 1,154p Expected volatility 20% 25% 30% 30% Expected life 6 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Expected dividends 3.4% 2.9% 2.2% 2.2% Risk-free rate of return 4.1% 4.7% 5.0% 2.5% Awards in Awards in Awards in Share bonuses 2007 2008 2009 Fair value 775p to 1116p 456p to 672p 1029p to 1245p Share price at purchase 829p to 1193p 482p to 710p 1100p to 1330p Expected volatility 30% 30% 30% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends 2.2% 1.8% 2.2% The fair value of the award under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan EGRIP has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

22 Related party transactions The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and with its directors and members of key management.
There are no transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group.
The remuneration of individual directors is disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The remuneration of directors and other members of key management during the year was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Short-term employee benefits 5,211 5,236 Post employment benefits 8 3 Equity compensation benefits 481 492 Total remuneration of directors and key management 5,700 5,731 The Company leases office premises and provides treasury management on behalf of Group companies in the UK.
Rent and service charges are charged at cost, 1,119,000 2008: 1,097,000.
All income arising from cash and cash equivalents is retained by the Company.
23 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, which arise in the normal course of the Companys and Groups business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose the Group to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Our largest customer accounts for less than 5% of the Group revenue and the ten largest customers account for less than 30% of the Group revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in the Group's treasury policy.
The maximum deposit with a counterparty is 5,100,000.
The trade receivables for the Group as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
There were no trade receivables for the Company.
Fidessa group plc 66 Notes to the financial statements continued 2009 2008 000 000 Not due 34,184 28,495 Not more than three months past due 21,596 18,822 More than three months but not more than six months past due 1,892 1,964 More than six months past due 2,803 610 Trade receivables 60,475 49,891 All material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance being due to insolvency or age of receivable.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The movement in the year in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below.
2009 2008 000 000 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 1st January 1,369 840 Exchange adjustment 43 206 Allowances released in the period 947 556 New allowances made in the period 875 879 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 31st December 1,254 1,369 Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.

Interest receivable and payable The Group and the Company holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Groups and the Company's overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice this means that no deposits are made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
The Group has no borrowings.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 67 Foreign currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Euros and Japanese Yen.
The Group has both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a natural hedge.
In managing currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact on short-term fluctuations on the Groups cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
The Group has not entered into hedging contracts for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against other currencies would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 127,000 for the year ended 31st December 2009 2008: 148,000.
Capital management The Company maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business.
Special dividends have been used to return surplus capital to shareholders.
The Board monitors the retained cash and reserves and determines the level of annual dividend and when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the Group and Companys financial instruments.
For current trade and other receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the amortised cost is deemed to reflect the fair value.

Fidessa group plc 68 Notes to the financial statements continued 25 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised below.
This summary is not a list of all risks, estimates and judgements encountered by the group and others could arise that cause a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
a Development expenditure The Group invests in the development of future products and material enhancement of existing products in accordance with the accounting policy.
The assessment as to whether each element of this expenditure will be technically feasible, generate future economic benefit or the period over which to amortise the expenditure is a matter of judgement.
The carrying value of product development capitalised is detailed in note 14 and the amounts capitalised and amortised in the year are detailed in note 5. b Income taxes In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain and on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
c Revenue The revenue for perpetual software licences and fixed price implementations is recognised on a percentage of completion basis.
Management exercises judgement in determining the percentage complete for software and consultancy revenue and the total cost of implementation.
Estimates are continually revised based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
In recognising revenue on contracts where losses are expected the quantum of the loss has to be estimated based on the latest facts available and judgement applied to factors that are still variable.
d Fair values IFRSs require many assets, liabilities and expenses to be recognised at fair value.
This includes the intangible assets notes 13 and 14, potential gains held in escrow in respect of the sale of investment in Touchpaper note 15 and other liabilities arising from acquisitions.
By their nature fair values are estimates and subject to different interpretation.
e Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash generating units, managements estimates of discount rates, long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates note 12.
If the results of the cash generating unit in a future period are materially adverse to the estimates used for the impairment testing an impairment charge may be triggered.
