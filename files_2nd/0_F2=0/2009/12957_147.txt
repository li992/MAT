Randgold and AngloGold Ashanti, through their indirect jointly owned subsidiary, now control Moto, having acquired all 111 085 009 outstanding Moto common shares.
The acquisition had the following effect on the groups assets and liabilities: Book Fair value Fair US$000 values adjustments values Fair value of Moto net assets acquired at acquisition date: Cash and cash equivalents 9 440 9 440 Property, plant and equipment 1 024 1 024 Mineral properties 226 170 8 707 234 877 Trade and other receivables 3 851 3 851 Available-for-sale financial assets 3 150 3 150 Inventory 11 11 Trade and other payables 3 911 8 707 12 618 Non-controlling interest 46 060 46 060 193 675 - 193 675 Randgold on acquisition share of net assets acquired 50% 96 838 Fair value of the net consideration paid by Randgold 327 824 Less Randgold share of fair value of Moto assets and liabilities acquired 96 838 Excess of fair value of consideration paid over fair value of net assets acquired 230 986 The fair value adjustments arise in respect of under-provided taxation liabilities and payments due to the DRC government.
The excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$231 million is wholly attributed to mineral properties as it represents the gold resources of the Kibali gold project: Moto owns a 70% interest in the Kibali project and therefore following the acquisition of the joint venture interest in Moto, Randgold had an indirect 35% interest in Kibali Goldmines SPRL which holds the licence in respect of the Kibali gold project.
Randgolds 50% share in Moto has been proportionately consolidated from 15 October 2009 and a 15% non-controlling interest in Kibali Goldmines SPRL recognised.
No deferred taxation liability arose on the transaction, as the transaction constituted an acquisition of a joint venture interest and not a business combination.
Fair US$000 values The fair value of the consideration paid by Randgold comprises: Fair value of 6 628 769 shares issued at the market price of US$72.92 483 370 Cash consideration paid to Moto shareholders 76 864 Net cash consideration paid to Moto warrant and option holders 705 Fair value of 50% of the share options issued to Moto option holders 10 094 Less cash consideration paid by AngloGold Ashanti 76 864 Less cash paid by AngloGold Ashanti to Randgold 171 233 Transaction costs 4 888 Total consideration paid by Randgold 327 824 Acquisition of further interest in the Kibali project On 22 December 2009 Randgold, in conjunction with its joint venture partner AngloGold Ashanti, completed the acquisition of 20% of Kibali Goldmines SPRL, through their indirect jointly owned subsidiary Kibali Jersey Ltd.
The cash consideration paid was US$113.6 million and therefore each company paid US$56.8 million for their respective 10% shareholding.
Randgold also incurred US$1.2 million of transaction costs bringing the total consideration for Randgolds 10% interest to US$58 million.
The fair value of the net assets acquired was US$14.5 million.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$43.5 million has been wholly attributed to mineral properties as it represents the increase in Randgolds interest in the gold resources of the Kibali gold project.
As a result of this further acquisition Randgold has a 45% interest in Kibali Goldmines SPRL: 35% is held indirectly through its joint venture interest in Moto Goldmines Ltd and 10% indirectly through its joint venture interest in Kibali Jersey Ltd. As a result the non-controlling interest recognised in respect of Kibali Goldmines SPRL has been reduced from 15% to 5% from 22 December 2009.
