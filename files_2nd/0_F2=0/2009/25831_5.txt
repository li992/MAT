1 The Growth shares were created following a capital reorganisation on 2nd August 2006 when ordinary shareholders elected to reclassify their shares into either Growth shares or Income shares.
The financial record above for periods prior to that date is that of the ordinary shares because the Growth pool has maintained materially the same economic exposure as if the reorganisation had not been implemented.
The investment objective, investment policy, benchmark and management fee arrangements have remained the same as for the ordinary shares prior to the reorganisation.
