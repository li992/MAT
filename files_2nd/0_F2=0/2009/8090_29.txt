Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The fair value is measured using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation techniques.
The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the Share Matching Plan where the proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is considered the most appropriate.
In terms of FRS 20 Share-based payment, where a parent grants rights to its equity instruments of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in accordance with UITF 44 FRS 20 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Transactions the Company has recognised an addition to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions that have accrued in the period after the Company became the ultimate holding company of the Group of 0.5m with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders funds.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions arising from operating activities are translated from local currency into pounds sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency gains or losses are credited or charged to the Profit and Loss account as they arise.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest expense Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Profit and Loss account at a constant rate over the life of the debt.
