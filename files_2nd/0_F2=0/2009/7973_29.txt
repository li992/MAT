The issue raised 234.3m net of issue costs of 14.3m.
The structure utilised to facilitate the Rights Issue attracted merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 and as a result the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued was initially recorded as a merger reserve.
Subsequent internal transactions required to complete the Rights Issue resulted in the excess of 192.9m being transferred to retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders.
Prior to the Rights Issue, the nominal value of 25p of each existing ordinary share exceeded the proposed issue price of 6p of each new ordinary share.
As it was not possible for the Company to issue shares at less than their nominal value, the existing shares were subdivided into one new ordinary share of 1p and one deferred share of 24p.
The rights attached to the deferred shares, which are not listed, are limited.
Holders of deferred shares have no voting, dividend or capital distribution rights, save for very limited rights on a winding up.
It is intended that they will be cancelled and an appropriate reserve created in due course.
