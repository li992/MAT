In 2009, costs directly attributable to acquisitions have been incurred in respect of: Dooley Construction Limited Partnership RT Dooley 1m and Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc 15m.
In 2004 the OFT initiated an investigation into tender activities across the UK construction sector.
The OFT concluded its investigation in 2009 and determined that these activities amounted to breaches of competition law in the UK.
As a result of the decision, Mansell was fined 5m in respect of such instances, all of which took place before its acquisition by the Group.
The Company and its operating businesses co-operated with the OFT throughout the investigation.
Reorganisation and integration costs of 12m 2008: 6m have been incurred, 8m 2008: nil relating to Parsons Brinckerhoff, 2m 2008: nil of which was borne by the Company, 1m 2008: 3m relating to Balfour Beatty Communities formerly GMH Military Housing, nil 2008: 1m of which was borne by the Company, 2m 2008: 2m relating to Dean & Dyball, 3m 2008: nil relating to Schreck-Mieves, 1m 2008: nil relating to Douglas E Barnhart and a gain of 3m 2008: nil recognised in relation to the relocation of certain Rail UK businesses.
In 2008 costs of 1m were incurred in the US on the reorganisation of the central division of Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc formerly Balfour Beatty Construction Inc. An impairment charge of 4m 2008: nil has been incurred in respect of writing down buildings and inventory of railway facilities in Germany to their fair value less costs to sell due to a decision by a main customer to consolidate procurement over fewer production facilities.
On the acquisition of Birse Group, tax losses were acquired which did not satisfy the criteria for recognition in the statement of financial position at the date of acquisition.
In 2008 a portion of these losses was recognisable and the benefit was recorded as part of the Groups tax charge in exceptional items.
IAS 12 applicable to the 2008 results stipulates that in addition to recognising the tax benefit the carrying amount of goodwill recognised on the acquisition is reduced, with the reduction treated as an expense.
As a result of the UK Finance Act 2008, tax depreciation allowances on industrial buildings are being reduced to nil on a phased basis.
In 2008 joint ventures and associates of the Group recognised a 4m deferred tax charge which was required under IAS 12 to establish a deferred tax liability.
This liability will be released to the statement of financial performance as the relevant assets are depreciated for accounting purposes.
In addition, a 1m deferred tax credit was recognised following agreement with HMRC on the basis of taxing certain PPP concessions.
8.2 Due to the volatile currency markets, the Group entered into a number of foreign exchange option contracts in 2009 at a cost of 15m to limit the cash outow for the planned settlement of the Groups foreign exchange contracts in respect of net investment hedging.
In 2008 a premium of 0.1m arose on the repurchase for cancellation of 0.3m preference shares at a cost of 0.4m which was charged to exceptional finance costs.
No preference shares were repurchased in 2009.
8.3 The exceptional items credited to charged against profit from operations have given rise to a net tax charge of 18m 2008: 12m charge.
As a result of the Finance Act 2009, future dividend income from outside the UK will be exempt from UK corporation tax which has led to the release of 10m of deferred tax in the UK.
In addition, there has been a release of 6m of US deferred tax in relation to unremitted earnings where future additional US tax will no longer be incurred.
Subsidiaries of the Group recognised a 3m deferred tax charge in 2008 to establish a deferred tax liability in relation to industrial building allowances which was required under IAS 12.
This liability is being released to the statement of financial performance as the relevant buildings are depreciated for accounting purposes.

The calculation of basic earnings is based on profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders.
The calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares was affected by the issue of 205,502,237 ordinary shares on 22 October 2009 and the issue of 43,320,411 ordinary shares on 20 May 2008.
It has been adjusted for the conversion of share options in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share.
No adjustment has been made in respect of the potential conversion of the cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares, the effect of which would have been antidilutive throughout each period.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, before post-tax exceptional items and post-tax amortisation of intangible assets, has been disclosed to give a clearer understanding of the Groups underlying trading performance.
The per share information has been restated for the bonus element of the 2009 rights issue described in Note 28.2.
The adjustment factor has been calculated by dividing the share price immediately before the shares were quoted ex-rights 316.0p with the theoretical ex-rights price 275.2p, giving an adjustment factor of 1.14826.

Cash flow forecasts have been based on the expected workload of each cash generating unit CGU giving consideration to the current level of confirmed orders and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups 2010 budget and medium-term plan.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its revenue growth rate and discount rate.
The growth rate has been applied to cash flows after three years into perpetuity and reflects published GDP growth rates for the economic environment of each CGU.
The cash flows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate in the range of 10.6%12.8% 2008: 10.6%12.2%.
The discount rates are revised annually applying updated market inputs to the capital asset pricing model.

The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.
A reasonably possible change in a single assumption will not cause impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
However, a significant adverse change in the key assumptions could result in an impairment in the Balfour Beatty Communities CGU as its fair value currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 7% and in the Balfour Beatty Rail Inc CGU as its fair value currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 30%.
The carrying value of the goodwill of Balfour Beatty Communities is 41m and of Balfour Beatty Rail Inc 15m.

The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial liabilities including interest that will accrue to those liabilities except where the Group is entitled to and intends to repay the liability before its maturity.
The discount column represents the possible future cash flows included in the maturity analysis, such as future interest, that have not been included in the carrying value of the financial liability.
The maturity profile of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: PPP Total non-recourse Other non-derivative project Other financial financial Total Carrying finance borrowings liabilities liabilities discount value 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 m m m m m m Due on demand or within one year 20 23 2,170 2,213 12 2,201 Due within one to two years 11 1 65 77 15 62 Due within two to five years 54 6 53 113 56 57 Due after more than five years 424 6 246 676 315 361 509 36 2,534 3,079 398 2,681 Discount 251 147 398 Carrying value 258 36 2,387 2,681 PPP Total non-recourse Other non-derivative project Other financial financial Total Carrying finance borrowings liabilities liabilities discount value 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 m m m m m m Due on demand or within one year 4 12 1,996 2,012 15 1,997 Due within one to two years 18 1 52 71 20 51 Due within two to five years 39 8 46 93 58 35 Due after more than five years 320 263 583 306 277 381 21 2,357 2,759 399 2,360 Discount 236163 399 Carrying value 145 21 2,194 2,360 122 Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial liabilities gross maturity The following table details the Groups expected maturity for its derivative financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis interest rate swaps and undiscounted gross inflows outflows for those derivatives that require gross settlement foreign exchange contracts.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates, using the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse impact of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company: forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the Groups investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures: foreign exchange option contracts to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the settlement of net investment hedge contracts and the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries: commodity forward contracts to manage the commodity price risk associated with the Groups operational requirements for certain commodities, such as fuel: and interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability associated with variable interest rates on borrowings in PPP concessions.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and with the exception of the change in the net investment hedging policy outlined below there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks from 2008. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Group Treasury enters into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above pre-set materiality levels determined by the Finance Director whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified.
Hedge accounting is applied to these transactions above a predetermined materiality level.
Details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures are set out on page 121.
As at 31 December 2009, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 72m 2008: 74m.
The period during which the cash ows are expected to occur is up to three years.
This will affect the statement of financial performance throughout the same periods.
Our accounts Annual report and accounts 2009 123 20 Financial instruments continued i Foreign currency risk management continued The Group has designated forward exchange contracts against highly probable capital expenditure and inventory sales which are expected to occur in up to three years with a notional principal amount of 23m 2008: 24m as cash ow hedges.
Fair value losses of 2m 2008: 2m gains have been taken to hedging reserves within equity in relation to these contracts.
The cumulative amounts deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at year end is nil 2008: 2m gain.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk which has previously been managed by matching significant net assets denominated in currencies other than sterling principally using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
During 2008 and 2009 management have amended the policy to reduce the level of net assets hedged taking account of the potential cash effect of the hedging programme against the potential effect of movements in currencies on the Groups net assets.
At 31 December 2009 no foreign currency denominated net assets were hedged.
At 31 December 2008 approximately 45% of the US dollar denominated net assets were hedged.
As derivative financial instruments are no longer held for US dollar denominated assets, only 2008 comparative gures are provided in respect of US dollar movements.
In 2008, the effect of a 35% strengthening weakening in US dollar exchange rates against sterling would have resulted in a 87m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in US dollars.
These movements would have been taken directly to equity and would have partially offset opposing gains losses in the net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The percentage change applied to US dollars in 2008 has been based on the greater of the average movement in the previous five reporting periods or the actual movement in the last 12 months.
The notional principal amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations at 31 December 2008 was 188m.
The gains and losses in equity on hedges of net investments in foreign operations will be released to the statement of financial performance on the disposal of the underlying net investment.
No amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged to the statement of financial performance in relation to any foreign exchange cash flow or net investment hedges.
A gain of 1m 2008: 6m was recognised in investment income in relation to the forward point fair value movements on net investment hedge contracts.
ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups PPP concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Group policy is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swaps, to hedge the cash flow variability of the interest.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable period-end yield curve.
The net impact of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
During 2009 and 2008, the Groups PPP borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding PPP subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2009 were 269m 2008: 142m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 25 years.
At 31 December 2009, the xed interest rates range from 4.5% to 5.1% 2008: 4.6% to 5.1% and the principal oating rates are LIBOR.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 12m 2008: 14m increase decrease in amounts taken directly by the Group to equity.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its PPP subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and non-PPP borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 2m 2008: 2m increase decrease in the Groups net investment income.
iii Commodity price risk management The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its normal operations.
During 2009 the Group entered into a number of commodity hedge contracts to manage some of the Groups exposure to the price of fuel.
The value of fuel covered by those hedges amounted to 3m 2008: nil.
These commodity hedge contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges against highly probable future fuel purchases forecast to occur over the next two years.
At 31 December 2009 the fuel hedge contracts had a fair value of nil 2008: nil and no gains or losses have been recognised in respect of these contracts in the current or prior periods either in the statement of comprehensive income in respect of the effective portion of the hedge or the statement of financial performance in respect of ineffectiveness.
iv Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its PPP concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
To the extent that inflation differs from the index used, the Group is exposed to a price risk.
124 Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instruments continued b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of depositing funds only with independently rated counterparties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A.
At 31 December 2009 27m 2008 2m did not meet this criterion due to the unprecedented decline in credit ratings generally and operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances.
No losses are anticipated from non-performance of these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
At 31 December 2009 27m 2008 30m did not meet this policy due to operational reasons.
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Groups most significant customers are public or quasi public sector entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 23.1.
The maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities is set out above.
Fair value estimation The Group holds a number of financial instruments on the statement of financial position at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability depending on the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1: The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group holds available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued based on the closing per unit market price at 31 December.
Level 2: The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising applicable year end yield curves.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Level 3: The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Group's PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin that represents the fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets.
The subsequent movement in the fair value is taken to equity.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.
Financial instruments measured at fair value Fair value measurement 2009 Fair value measurement 2008 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Available-for-sale mutual fund financial assets 41 41 Financial assets foreign currency contracts 1 1 5 5 Available-for-sale PPP financial assets 260 260 151 151 Total assets measured at fair value 41 1 260 302 5 151 156 Financial liabilities foreign currency contracts 1 1 Financial liabilities interest rate swaps 24 24 106 106 Total liabilities measured at fair value 25 25 106 106 In respect of the Level 3 PPP financial assets, a change in the discount rate would have a significant effect on the value of the asset and a 50 basis points increase decrease, which represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in the risk adjusted discount rate, would lead to a 6m 2008:1m change in the fair value of the assets.
The movement would be taken through equity.
Refer to Note 17 for a reconciliation of the movement of the opening balance to the closing balance.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

The Companys external contracts are perfectly matched with derivative contracts issued by the Company to the Groups operating companies.
The Companys financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are the foreign currency contracts shown in the table above.
The fair value of these foreign currency contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.

ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 4m 2008: 4m decrease increase in the Companys investment income.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to equity.
b Credit risk The additional credit risk that the Company bears is in respect of amounts due from subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due at the reporting date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements.

The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the reporting date, the undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 500m 2008: 350m and for joint ventures and associates was 50m 2008: nil.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because no temporary difference arises.

Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
The majority of the Groups defined benefit schemes are funded.
Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups main scheme is the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members with the exception of certain employees transferring under TUPE.
During 2008 and 2009 the Group implemented measures to limit the increase in pensionable pay of certain groups of in-service defined benefit members, giving rise to a reduction in past service liabilities of 100m 2008: 60m, which has been classified as an exceptional item in the statement of financial performance.
On 31 May 2009 the Mansell plc Pension Scheme and the Hall & Tawse Retirement Benefit Plan Mansell schemes merged with the BBPF.
The investment strategy of the BBPF scheme is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth to meet, together with any contributions from the Group, the cost of current and future benefits.
The BBPF invests in equities in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the liabilities.
The majority of the BBPF equities are in the form of pooled funds.
The BBPF invests in fixed and index-linked bonds and inflation swaps in order to match the duration and inflation exposure of a portion of the liabilities.
The BBPF invests in corporate fixed-interest bonds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will outperform equivalent government bonds.
A portion of the corporate bonds is overlaid with inflation swaps in order to create a better match between the assets and the inflation-linked characteristics of the liabilities.
The performance of equities and bonds is measured against market indices.
Where the BBPF invests in funds of hedge funds this is in order to improve diversification.
There are three funds of hedge funds to further improve diversification.
The performance of the fund of hedge fund managers is measured against three month LIBOR.
Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members with the exception of certain employees transferring under TUPE.
The economic interest of the Group in this shared cost scheme is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities, based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd operates a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme.
The Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme has a legal charge over a Group leasehold property with a book value of 6m 2008: nil.
With the exception of the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme, active members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the USA, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 16.1 for the ultimate benefit of the employees in a trust, the assets of which are available to Group creditors in the event of insolvency.

Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on a high quality corporate bond.
Pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net interest income arising from the expected return on plan assets and the interest on scheme obligations is credited to investment income or finance charges as appropriate.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
The IAS 19 accounting valuation is set out in 25.1 below.
A different calculation is used for the regular valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme liabilities.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the liabilities are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond as required by IAS 19 for the accounting basis.
Details of the previous formal funding basis valuations are set out in 25.2 below.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets of the Group.
The Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme has an interest in a property under an operating lease that is occupied under an operating sublease by a Group company which pays an annual rental of 0.2m 2008: nil.

The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
This research is taken into account in the Groups mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes.
The mortality tables adopted for the 2009 and 2008 IAS 19 valuations are the 1992 series calendar year 2007 tables, with future improvements applicable to each members year of birth under the medium cohort effect from 2007.

The rates of return for each class were determined as follows: equities, the long-term rates of return on equities, funds of hedge funds and property are derived from current risk free rates of return with the addition of an appropriate future risk premium from an analysis of historic returns, current market conditions and forward looking views from market participants: bonds: the rate has been set to reflect the yields available on the gilts and corporate bond holdings held at 31 December: cash and other net assets: this class principally comprises inflation rate swaps and cash holdings and the rate adopted reflects current short-term returns on cash deposits.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the principal dened benefit schemes during 2010 are as follows: Balfour Beatty Railways Parsons Pension Pension Brinckerhoff Fund Scheme Scheme Total 2010 2010 2010 2010 m m m m Regular funding 37 2 39 Deficit funding 23 1 6 30 Total 60 3 6 69 The estimated deficit funding of 23m in the BBPF above is benefiting from a prepayment of 10m in 2009.
Additional payments estimated at up to 20m may be paid in 2010 to fund an enhanced transfer value exercise.
The sensitivity of the Groups pension obligations and of the prospective 2010 charge to the Groups statement of financial performance to different actuarial assumptions is as follows: Increase Increase Increase Increase Increase decrease in decrease in decrease in decrease in decrease in investment total pension Percentage obligations service cost finance cost return cost points years % m m m m m Increase in discount rate 0.5% 7.7 204 5 1 4 Increase in inflation rate 0.5% 5.7 151 2 8 10 Increase in salary above inflation 0.5% 0.5 13 1 1 2 Increase in return on assets 0.5% 11 11 Increase in life expectancy one year 3.6 96 2 5 7 The sensitivities relating to the discount rate, inflation rate and expected return on assets in respect of the pension cost elements in the statement of financial performance are shown for information only.
The amounts that will be included in the 2010 statement of financial performance are derived from the market conditions at 1 January 2010 and subsequent changes in market conditions will have no effect on the 2010 statement of financial performance and will be reflected as actuarial adjustments in the statement of comprehensive income.

Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income, but each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
In the tables above, the share options outstanding at 31 December 2008 have been adjusted onto a comparable basis.
On 18 May 2009, options were granted over 2,883,694 adjusted ordinary shares under the Balfour Beatty savings-related share option scheme, at 249p adjusted per share, and these are normally exercisable in the periods from July 2012 to December 2012 and from July 2014 to December 2014 depending upon the length of savings contract chosen by the participant.

During the year, no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by the Company.
In 2008, 300,017 preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by the Company for a total consideration of 407,337 at an average price of 135.8p.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half-yearly.
Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 112m at 31 December 2009 2008: 112m.
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30 day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference shares or a resolution for the winding-up of the Company.
On a winding-up of the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of 1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are regarded as a compound instrument, comprising an equity and a liability component.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity, net of deferred tax.
The liability component recognised in the statement of financial position is calculated as follows: 2009 2008 m m Redemption value of shares in issue at 1 January 112 112 Equity component 16 16 Deferred tax and interest element 9 9 Liability component at 1 January at amortised cost 87 87 Interest accretion 1 Repurchase of preference shares Liability component at 31 December at amortised cost 88 87 The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2009 amounted to 153m 2008: 134m.
The fair value is determined by using the market price of the preference shares at the reporting date.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.

By special resolution on 13 May 2004, confirmed by the court on 16 June 2004, the share premium account was reduced by 181m and the 4m capital redemption reserve was cancelled, effective on 25 June 2004, and a special reserve of 185m was created.
This reserve becomes distributable to the extent of future increases in share capital and share premium account, of which 107m occurred in 2009 2008: 25m.
On 17 September 2009 the Company announced a fully underwritten 3 for 7 rights issue at a subscription price of 180p per new ordinary share to substantially finance the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc.
The rights issue and acquisition were approved by the holders of the Companys ordinary shares at a general meeting on 7 October 2009 and the rights issue closed on 22 October 2009.
205,502,237 new ordinary shares were issued, raising 352m after issue costs and expenses of 18m.
The rights issue utilised a cash box structure and therefore qualied for merger relief under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 so that the premium arising was not required to be credited to the Companys share premium account.
The cash box entity, Bentworth No.
2 Ltd Bentworth 2, issued redeemable preference shares in consideration for the receipt of the cash proceeds net of issue costs arising from the rights issue.
The Companys new ordinary shares were issued as consideration for the transfer to it of the shares in Bentworth 2 which it did not already own.
As a result, the issue qualied for merger relief under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 so that the 252m excess of the value of the acquired shares in Bentworth 2 over the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued by the Company was credited to the Companys merger reserve, which was subsequently charged with 3m of rights issue expenses.
The rights issue was directly associated with the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc and therefore the merger reserve is not available for distribution to shareholders.
On 20 May 2008, 43,320,411 ordinary shares were issued and placed with institutions at a price of 430p per share.
The net proceeds after issue costs were 182m.
The placing utilised a cash box structure.
The cash box entity, Bentworth Ltd, issued redeemable preference shares in consideration for the receipt of the cash proceeds net of issue costs arising from the placing.
The Companys ordinary shares were issued as consideration for the transfer to it of the shares in Bentworth Ltd which it did not already own.
As a result, the placing qualified for merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 so that the 161m excess of the value of the acquired shares in Bentworth Ltd over the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued by the Company was credited to the Companys merger reserve.
The preference shares in Bentworth Ltd were subsequently redeemed and the Company transferred 161m from the merger reserve to the profit and loss reserve, which is available for distribution to shareholders.
28.3 The retained profits in the Group and the retained profit of the Company are stated net of investments in Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares of 50p each acquired by the Groups employee discretionary trust, the Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust, to satisfy awards under the Balfour Beatty performance share plan and the Balfour Beatty deferred bonus plan.
In 2009, 0.8m 2008: 3.0m shares were purchased at a cost of 3.0m 2008: 12.8m and the Trust subscribed 2.7m for 1.5m new shares under the rights issue.
The market value of the 4.2m 2008: 3.7m shares held by the Trust at 31 December 2009 was 10.8m 2008: 12.2m.
Following confirmation of the performance criteria at the end of the performance period in the case of the performance share plan, and at the end of the vesting period in the case of the deferred bonus plan, the appropriate number of shares will be unconditionally transferred to participants.
In 2009, 1.4m shares were transferred to participants in relation to the April 2006 awards under the performance share plan 2008: 1.1m shares for the April 2005 awards, and 0.4m shares were transferred to participants in relation to the March 2006 awards under the deferred bonus plan.
The trustees have waived the rights to dividends on shares held by the Trust.
Other reserves in the Group and the Company include 6.4m relating to unvested performance share plan awards 2008: 7.6m, 5.9m relating to unvested share options 2008: 5.8m, and 3.8m relating to unvested deferred bonus plan awards 2008: 3.0m.

The value of receivables against which there is a provision is 23m $39m.
The contingent consideration arrangements require the performance of specific contracts to exceed predefined thresholds in order to become payable and are dependent on the outcome of settling certain historical insurance claims.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments and receipts that the Group could be required to make or receive under the contingent consideration arrangements is between 16m receivable and 11m payable.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements is 7m receivable.
This was estimated by applying the provisions of the purchase agreement to the current management assessment of possible outcomes and discounting the expected contract costs and insurance claim proceeds to their present value.
Parsons Brinckerhoff earned revenue of 248m, including its share of revenue from joint ventures and associates of 4m, and incurred a loss from operations excluding exceptional items and amortisation of 1m in the period since acquisition.
Other acquisitions The fair value of working capital includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of 64m and a gross contractual value of 65m.
The value of receivables against which there is a provision is 1m.
The contingent consideration arrangements relating to the acquisition of SpawMaxwell require the acquired business to perform above a predefined performance level.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangements is 3m, which is equal to the amount recognised as the fair value of contingent consideration.
Since acquisition the other acquired businesses earned revenues of 117m and made profits from operations excluding exceptional items and amortisation of 2m.

The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions since 7 November 2002 of 6.8m in 2009 2008: 8.8m.
Following the rights issue described in Note 28.2, adjustments were made to the number of shares under option and the exercise prices in accordance with the HMRC approved standard formula.
The same adjustment formula was used to adjust the awards under the performance share plan and the deferred bonus plan.
Numbers and prices prior to the rights issue have been adjusted onto a comparable basis.
30.2 Savings-related share options The Company operates an HMRC approved savings-related share option scheme SAYE under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company in either three or five years time, dependent upon their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions to a savings account over the relevant period.
These savings are used to fund the option exercise.
This scheme is open to all employees based in the UK and performance conditions are not applied to the exercise of SAYE options.
Employees normally have a period of six months after completion of the savings contributions during which to exercise the SAYE options, failing which they lapse.
Details of SAYE options granted during the year and outstanding at the end of the year are shown in Note 27.1.

30.4 Performance share plan awards The Company operates a performance share plan under which executive Directors and key senior employees are granted conditional awards of ordinary shares in the Company, which are exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of award.
These awards will only vest to the extent that performance targets are met over a three year performance period.
On 15 April 2009 a maximum of 2,999,265 conditional shares were awarded which are normally exercisable in April 2012.
50% of the 2009 award is based on an eps growth target: the maximum award of shares is made only where the Companys eps increases by at least RPI 39% in the relevant performance period: 25% of this element of the award is made where the Companys eps increases by RPI 9% over the period: if growth in eps is between RPI 9% and RPI 39%, the number of shares will be awarded pro-rata to the growth in eps: and no shares from this element of the award can be awarded if growth in eps is less than RPI 9% over the period.
The other 50% of that 2009 award is based on total shareholder return TSR performance measured against a group of UK listed companies operating in comparable markets to the Company: the maximum award of shares is made only where the Companys TSR is in the upper quartile: 25% of this element of the award is made where the Companys TSR is at the median: if the Companys TSR is between the median and the upper quartile, the number of shares will be awarded pro-rata: and no shares can be awarded if the Companys TSR is below median.

Where the Company enters into such agreements, it considers them to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
Guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
An associate is a member of a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan where there is insufficient information on which to base a reliable estimate of any potential defined benefit obligation and accordingly the associate is accounting for the plan as a defined contribution plan.
Under certain circumstances it is possible that additional contributions may be made to fund the deficit attributable to the associate, however no reliable estimate can be made of whether and to what extent a liability may crystallise.
As stated in Note 26, provision has been made for the Directors best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
33 Related party transactions Joint ventures and associates The Group has contracted with, provided services to, and received management fees from, certain joint ventures and associates amounting to 939m 2008: 693m.
These transactions occurred in the normal course of business at market rates and terms.

The amounts due to or from joint ventures and associates at 31 December are disclosed within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in Notes 21 and 22 respectively.
Pension schemes The Group recharged the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund with the costs of administration and advisers fees borne by the Group amounting to 5.0m in 2009 2008: 4.5m.

Our accounts Annual report and accounts 2009 157 36 Principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates continued e Military housing Summary: Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number of US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 44 military bases that provide speciality housing to US military personnel and their families.
Project descriptions: The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, covering 16 Army bases: four projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force, covering nine Air Force bases and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy, covering 19 Navy bases.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project at Fort Stewart, located in Hinesville, Georgia.
These projects in operation cover 44 domestic bases located in 20 states and Washington, DC and Balfour Beatty Communities expects them to contain over 33,000 end-state housing units once full development, construction and renovation have been completed.
The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
For each project, Balfour Beatty Communities creates a special purpose entity to serve as the owner of the project, which is typically either a limited liability company or general partnership.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : and, whereas the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
Contractual arrangements: On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management and development of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, potentially could extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50 year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units through various predetermined project phases.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCs leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the US Government.
Preferred returns: The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual, minimum preferred rate of return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts generally will accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the US Government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
Split of remaining operating cash flows: Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities, the US Government and the reinvestment account held by the project for the benefit of the US Government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that each party is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these annual caps have ranged between approximately 11% to 17% depending on the particular project.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capital return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military branch.
Return of equity: Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions will have the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable.
