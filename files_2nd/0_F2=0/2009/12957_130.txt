The fair value gain arising was taken to other reserves in equity.
The shares in Volta Resources were acquired as part of the consideration received for the sale of the Kiaka project in Burkina Faso to Volta Resources as well as a deferred cash consideration of US$3.7 million, resulting in a gain on disposal of US$10.7 million after costs of US$0.3 million.
The gain on disposal is included in other income.
The shares in Kilo Goldmines were acquired as part of the Moto acquisition Refer note 30.
Management has no on-going involvement with the Kiaka project or Volta Resources and therefore in the absence of significant influence it is deemed to be appropriate to categorise the investments as available-for-sale financial assets.
The impairment of auction rate securities has been charged to the statement of comprehensive income as a component of finance costs.
