The Parent Companys profit for the financial year, after receipt of 475.0m of dividends from wholly owned subsidiary undertakings was 475.7m 2008: loss of 204.7m.

14 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust, the Employee Benefit Trust see note 25 and treasury shares, all of which are treated as cancelled, which were 300.3m 2008: 300.0m.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the year, giving a figure of 302.0m 2008: 301.0m Underlying earnings per share excludes exceptional items and impairment of intangible assets.
The earnings per share from continuing operations were as follows: 2009 2008 Basic earnings loss per share 24.7p 208.3p Underlying basic earnings per share 2.1p 35.3p Diluted earnings loss per share 24.5p 208.3p Underlying diluted earnings per share 2.1p 35.2p The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based upon the following data: 2009 2008 m m Underlying earnings attributable to shareholders 6.3 105.9 Exceptional items net of related taxation including exceptional intangible asset impairment 71.8 729.1 Goodwill impairment utilisation of strategic land holdings 4.0 1.8 Earnings loss attributable to shareholders 74.1 625.0 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 15 Intangible assets Goodwill Brand Know-how Total Group m m m m Cost At 1 January 2008, 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009 408.8 60.0 1.9 470.7 Accumulated impairment losses amortisation At 1 January 2008 2.4 0.5 2.9 Impairment losses for the year utilisation of strategic land holdings 1.8 1.8 Impairment losses for the year exceptional 201.0 201.0 Amortisation charge for the year 0.3 0.3 At 1 January 2009 205.2 0.8 206.0 Impairment losses for the year utilisation of strategic land holdings 4.0 4.0 Amortisation charge for the year 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 2009 209.2 1.1 210.3 Carrying amount At 31 December 2009 199.6 60.0 0.8 260.4 At 31 December 2008 203.6 60.0 1.1 264.7 Goodwill brought forward at the start of the year includes 165.5m 2008: 179.8m which arose on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs and is retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
37.0m 2008: 50.0m of this amount represented the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct cost changes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated for four years, to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
When performing the impairment review of the brands, the relevant retraction growth rates included therein vary between 2% to 12% 2008: 9% to 18%, reflecting the current state of the UK housing market.
The retraction growth rates in relation to the impairment review of goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings vary between 5% to 4% 2008: 6% to 8%.
After this period the retraction growth rates applied to calculate the cash flow forecasts vary between nil and 4% 2008: nil and 4% reflecting managements estimate of the forecast recovery in the UK housing market, which do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 8.0% and 10.0% 2008: 7% and 10% over the forecast periods.
The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
This review resulted in an underlying impairment of 4.0m 2008: 1.8m.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill will be completely impaired once the final plot that management expects to receive a satisfactory planning permission, is sold.
In 2008 as a result of the impairment review, the Group had an exceptional impairment charge against the goodwill arising from the purchase of Westbury plc of 188.0m and the Charles Church brand value of 13.0m.
On concluding the annual impairment testing, there remains 123.1m 2008: 126.3m and 37.3m 2008: 38.1m of Beazer and Westbury goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings and 37.0m 2008: 37.0m allocated to the Charles Church brand.
In addition, there is 60.0m 2008: 60.0m of carrying value in relation to the Westbury brand.
The remaining 2.2m 2008: 2.2m represents goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs.
Acquired know how is amortised over its estimated useful life, which is 10 years from the date of its inception.
In the event of deterioration in the UK housing market conditions, the possibility of impairment losses in the future remains.

In 2008 additional investments in existing subsidiaries during the year included 79.0m arising on the transfer of an indirect subsidiary investment to direct holding following internal restructuring and an increase in the capitalisation of an existing direct subsidiary of 46.8m.
In 2008 following the exceptional impairment of asset values held by subsidiaries, a review was carried out to confirm the recoverability of the investment value in existing subsidiaries of Persimmon Plc.
As a result of this the carrying value was found to be impaired by 281.7m.
Following a further review in 2009 there were no other impairments identified.
Details of Group undertakings are set out in note 32.

The difference between the nominal and the initial fair value is credited over the deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Group holds a second charge over property sold under shared equity schemes.
The 2008 impairment of the available for sale financial assets arose due to the impact on the fair value of those assets due to the decline in UK house prices and amounted to 4.9m in the period which was charged as an exceptional item in the statement of comprehensive income.
The 2009 review indicated no further impairment was required.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 23.

It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
As set out in note 6, the Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during 2009.
The impact of these reviews of our net realisable value provisions is a net exceptional credit to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income of 74.8m.
An impairment of land and work in progress of 209.3m was recognised in the year 2008: 664.1m restated and a reversal of 284.1m 2008: nil on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period.
These charges reversals mainly arose due to regional selling price movements being higher or lower than anticipated by management during the prior year reviews.
Our approach to our net realisable value review has been consistent with that conducted at 31 December 2008.
The key judgements in estimating the future net present realisable value of a site was the estimation of likely sales prices, house types and costs to complete the developments.
Sales prices and costs to complete were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon existing market conditions.
If the UK housing market were to improve or deteriorate in the future then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following the 2009 review, 752.3m 2008: 1,088.9m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
Land with a carrying value of 304.8m 2008: 389.5m was used as security for land payables note 22.
The value of inventories expensed in 2009 and included in cost of sales was 1,248.9m excluding an impairment reversal of 74.8m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period 2008: 1,434.9m, excluding the 664.1m exceptional impairment as restated.

Hedges have been taken out against all foreign currency denominated borrowings to hedge all principal payments to Sterling and to hedge foreign currency forward interest payments into Sterling payments at either fixed rates or rates linked to UK Libor.
These hedges therefore form both a hedge of foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk.

The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Land payables are reduced for imputed interest, which is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the credit period of the purchase contract.
23 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to them.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered to apply to the Company as well.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs an annual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and the value of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group has entered into a number of hedge derivative arrangements to limit its exposure to these risks, particularly exchange risk.
The Group enters into such transactions only as part of periodic wider refinancing undertakings to take advantage of the mature private placement markets in other countries notably the USA and only with the approval of the Board of Directors.
The Group applies hedge accounting to these arrangements in order to minimise profit and loss volatility.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued Currency risk The Groups currency risk principally resides in senior loan notes issued in US dollars and Euros to institutional investors.
The Group has entered into hedge arrangements for all such loan notes swapping them into Sterling on issue.
These hedges match the contractual maturity of all principal payments and also match foreign currency contractual interest payment maturities, swapping these to either fixed Sterling payments designated cash flow hedges or Sterling payments linked to UK LIBOR designated fair value hedges.
In this manner the Groups foreign currency senior loan note cash flows are effectively hedged to mirror those of either a fixed or floating rate Sterling denominated loan.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese jointly controlled entities.
These interests are not hedged.
These investments are considered to be long term in nature.
The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2009 2008 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate US Dollar 1.567 1.615 1.853 1.438 Euro 1.123 1.126 1.259 1.034 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2009 2008 USD Euro USD Euro $m m $m m Investments 3.0 3.5 Senior loan notes 555.0 5.0 735.2 5.0 Forward exchange contracts 555.0 5.0 735.2 5.0 Net exposure 3.0 3.5 Sensitivity analysis The hedging arrangements in place over borrowings are such that the Groups profit will be unaffected by any reasonably expected variation in US dollar sterling exchange rate at the reporting date 2008: nil.
A rise fall in the Euro Sterling exchange rate of 10% would result in a 0.3m loss gain in relation to investments 2008: 0.3m.
Interest rate risk The Group holds a mixture of both fixed and floating interest borrowings to control its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board of Directors and is continually reviewed in the light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Fixed rate borrowings are achieved by issuance of fixed rate GBP denominated senior loan notes and by interest rate swaps entered into as part of the hedging arrangements put in place for foreign currency denominated senior loan notes detailed under currency risk above.
The relative fixed floating balance of net debt, after consideration of hedging arrangements, is as follows: Group Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Fixed rate 127.8 130.8 51.7 54.1 Floating rate 122.9 470.4 18.7 316.1 Net debt 250.7 601.2 33.0 370.2 Sensitivity analysis If in the year ended 31 December 2009 UK interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower then the Groups pre-tax profit would have decreased increased by 2.2m 2008: 4.1m.
The Groups post-tax profit would have decreased increased by 1.6m 2008: 3.0m.
68 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued These sensitivities have been prepared in respect of the direct impact of such an interest rate change on the financing expense of financial instruments only, and do not attempt to estimate the indirect effect such a change may have on wider economic environment such as house pricing and exchange rates.
Housing market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
The Group has taken steps to control its speculative build, land acquisition activities and work in progress levels so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any further market disruption.
Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2009, if UK house prices had been 5% higher lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would increase decrease in value, excluding any effects of current or deferred tax, by 3.4m 2008: 1.3m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group remains confident of its continued compliance with financial covenants under both syndicated loan and private placement arrangements even in the event of further deterioration in market conditions.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
The liabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size of the Group.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities are cancellable on request from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour of more cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by five leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility committed to November 2010, at a rate linked to LIBOR.
Undrawn committed facilities at the reporting date amount to 600.0m 2008: 735.0m.
Furthermore the Group has secured a forward start facility of 322.3m from November 2010 to March 2012.
Refinancing As noted in our accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group completed its refinancing in March 2009.
This included amendments to the amount, terms and conditions of its Syndicated Credit Facility, provision of a new Forward Start Facility of 322m available for drawing from 24 November 2010 until 31 March 2012 and amendments to the terms and conditions of its existing private placement credit facilities.
The Directors consider the facilities provide ample headroom and a strong stable funding platform to support the continuing effective management of the business.
The Group has complied with all its covenants during the year.
There have been no payment defaults.
Repayment of private placement notes In August 2009 the Group prepaid $12.5m of private placement loan notes at face value ahead of their due date, by mutual agreement with the holder.
No penalties were paid by either party.
At the same point the related fair value hedge was cancelled.
A gain of 0.6m over carrying value was realised in relation to these cancellations.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued Cash deposits The Group has a policy of ensuring cash deposits are made with the primary objective of security of principal.
Accordingly deposits are made only with approved, respected, high credit rating financial institutions.
Deposits are spread across such institutions to minimise exposure to any single entity and are made on a short term basis only to preserve liquidity.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt borrowings as detailed in notes 21 and 27 offset by cash and bank balances and equity of the Group comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in the statement of changes in shareholders equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst also maintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and a system of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all management tiers.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Board.

In the majority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
The pressures of recent market conditions necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure during 2008.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned.
The Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Reductions in property values leads to an increase in the credit risk of the Group in respect of such sales.
The charge for provision for credit impairment in the year amounted to nil 2008: 4.9m.

Where no such price is readily available then fair value is determined by discounting net forward cash flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk adjusted rate.
In the case of available for sale assets there exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final timing and value of receipts which cannot be fully assessed from observable market data.
Available for sale assets consist of a substantial number of low value individual assets and have therefore, due to practical constraints, been valued based on market indices and not individual valuations.
Hedge accounting Persimmon currently hedge only foreign currency denominated private placement loan notes.
All hedging instruments are in the form of forward currency swap agreements, and the entirety of the Groups forward currency swap agreements are designated hedges.
The fair value of hedging instruments is an asset of 11.3m 2008: 116.8m.
As foreign currency loan notes all bear fixed interest rates it has been possible to exactly match the foreign currency cash flow requirements with these forward currency swaps, resulting in a very high level of effectiveness.
These swaps hedge all foreign currency cash flows: both principal and interest.
The swap agreements in respect of certain US private placement loan notes, and all EU private placement loan notes, hedge the fixed foreign currency interest cash flows to sterling cash flows linked to UK LIBOR.
These swaps therefore have the effect of mirroring a UK LIBOR linked loan arrangement.
These swaps are designated fair value hedges and hedge foreign currency risk.
Further swap agreements in respect of certain US private placement loan notes hedge the fixed foreign currency cash flows to fixed sterling cash flows.
These swaps therefore have the effect mirroring a UK fixed rate loan arrangement.
These swaps are designated cash flow hedges and hedge both foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The resulting balance of fixed and floating net debt after application of these hedges is disclosed under liquidity risk above.
The periods when the balances relating to cash flow hedges will affect profit are as follows: Group 2009 2008 m m Less than 1 year 0.6 0.4 12 years 0.3 25 years Over 5 years Carrying value 0.6 0.1 There was no hedge ineffectiveness during the period.

Provision is made for the Directors best estimate of all known legal claims and all legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
The Company has entered into guarantees of certain financial liabilities of related undertakings as detailed in note 33.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 77 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Operating leases At 31 December total outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: 2009 2008 Group as lessee m m Expiring within one year 0.8 0.8 Expiring in the second to fifth years inclusive 4.6 5.3 Expiring after five years 15.4 17.1 20.8 23.2 Company as lessee Expiring within one year 0.1 0.1 Expiring in the second to fifth years inclusive 0.2 0.2 Expiring after five years 0.3 0.3 The Group receives sundry rental income under short term leases arising from its long term land holdings.
There are no minimum lease receipts as no lease is held under a non-cancellable agreement.
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and motor vehicles.
Motor vehicles have an average term of 1.0 year to expiry 2008: 1.3 years.
Property leases have an average term of 7.9 years to expiry 2008: 9.1 years.
30 Retirement benefit obligations At 31 December 2009 the Group operated three employee pension schemes, a stakeholder scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as other comprehensive expense through the statement of comprehensive income.
All other pension scheme costs are reported as operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Expected costs in relation to current employees are charged to the relevant operating business.
All other pension scheme costs are borne by the Company.
Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme The Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme is a defined contribution scheme available to new salaried employees.
The Group matches employees own contributions to their individual Stakeholder plans up to 9% of basic salary depending on the length of service.
Group contributions to this scheme of 0.9m 2008: 1.2m are expensed through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme The Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Persimmon Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members in 2001.
The assets of the Persimmon Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
An actuarial valuation of the Persimmon Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2008 by a professionally qualified actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Persimmon Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members approach retirement.
Standard 2000 mortality tables applying a medium cohort effect with an underpin of 1.25% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females were used as a basis to calculate the future liability.
Prowting Pension Scheme On acquisition of Westbury plc in 2006 the Group assumed control of the Prowting Pension Scheme the Prowting Scheme a defined benefit scheme.
The Prowting Scheme was closed to new members prior to the acquisition.
The assets of the Prowting Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation of the Prowting Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 by a professionally qualified actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Prowting Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members approach retirement.
Standard 2000 mortality tables, applying a medium cohort effect with an underpin of 1.25% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females were used as a basis to calculate the future liability.
