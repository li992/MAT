overview performanCe review GovernanCe finanCiaL statements ashmore Group pLC ar 09 finanCiaL statements notes to the finanCiaL statements 55 notes to the financial statements 1 significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Company financial statements.
a Basis of preparation Group and Company The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Based on these adopted IFRS, the Directors have selected the accounting policies to be applied, which are set out below.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments and certain financial assets that are held as available-for-sale.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
Certain comparative amounts relating to foreign exchange have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
None of the changes are significant in nature.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
c foreign currency translation The Groups financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
indd 55 18 9 09 19:40:43 ashmore Group pLC ar 09 finanCiaL statements notes to the finanCiaL statements 56 notes to the financial statements continued 1 significant accounting policies continued d financial instruments i Derivatives The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage its foreign currency exposures.
Except when hedge accounting is applied, derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is entered into unless fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised.
Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is negative.
ii Financial assets The Group may, from time to time, invest in funds where an Ashmore Group subsidiary is the investment manager or an advisor seeding.
Where the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling stake, and is acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution, these seed investments are recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Where control is not deemed to exist, and the assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as available-for-sale financial assets.
The recognition policy for both is set out below: Financial assets held as non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where measurement and re-measurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5.
The relevant policy is set out in d i.
Where investments that have initially been recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale, because the Group has been deemed as holding a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted such that the Groups holding is now insufficient to be deemed a controlling stake, the investment will subsequently be reclassified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
Any such reclassification will crystallise any gain or loss previously recognised directly through equity within the income statement.
Subsequent movements will be recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for the newly adopted classification.
Financial assets held as available-for-sale For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement for the accounting period.
iii Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs.
The fair value on acquisition is normally the cost.
Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the income statement when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables are impaired.
However, if a longer term loan or receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts discounted using the prevailing market rates.
The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or interest income.
Subsequent to initial recognition these assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost less any impairment.
iv Hedge accounting The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria.
To qualify the following conditions must be met: Formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging instrument s and hedged item s must exist at inception.
The hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profitability.
The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured.
The hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed on an ongoing basis.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the effective hedging instrument is initially recognised in equity and is released to the income statement in the same period during which the relevant financial asset or liability affects profitability.
Where highly effective, any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Where the instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued.

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The useful life of office equipment is estimated to be five years.
In respect of leasehold improvements depreciation is charged over the remaining life of the lease or over the useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.
f intangible assets goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
g Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
h Deferred acquisition costs Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are charged as the related revenue is recognised.
i impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
j Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.

l share-based payments The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based compensation plans.
The awards have been classified as equity-settled under IFRS 2: Share-based Payments.
The fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value is measured using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
m own shares Own shares are held by an Employee Benefit Trust EBT which acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based compensation plans.
The holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group.
In both the Group and Company own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings.
n treasury shares Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
o revenue Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement as and when the related services are provided.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Specific revenue recognition policies are: i Management fees Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Where management fees are received in advance these are recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on experience of average holding periods for investments.
ii Performance fees Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise.
This is usually at the end of the performance period.
iii Other revenue Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the Group.
This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.
p Distribution costs Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.
q operating leases Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as a reduction in premises costs.

Interest income comprises interest receivable on the Groups cash and cash equivalents.
s taxation i Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
ii Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
iii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
t segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Currently, management consider that the Groups services comprise one business segment being provision of investment management services and that its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis.
This is demonstrated by the centralised nature of key investment, risk and operating committees.
u accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 27.

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Company In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company.
investment in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee or that guarantee expires for any reason.

the ashmore first Discretionary share option scheme option scheme The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000.
Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years and vest after five years from date of grant.
The fair value of options at each reporting year end have been accounted for on an equity-settled basis.
No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
the executive omnibus incentive plan omnibus plan The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options and or nil cost options to employees.
The Plan will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares.
These elements can be used singly or in combination.
the approved Company share option plan Csop The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding 30,000 per employee.
The CSOP qualifies as a UK-tax-approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC.

The recoverable amounts of the business are determined based upon future forecast profitability and cash flow projections.
The key assumptions on which management has based their projections are the expected fund flows and growth of AuM, which determine management and performance fee income.
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes.
Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units is possible, and the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole.
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and end of the year is 4.1 million and relates to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.
Goodwill arising in the Group during the year relates to the acquisition of Dolomite on 3 November 2008.
For further details on this acquisition please refer to note 22.
There has been no gross impairment of goodwill to date either within the Company or the Group.

Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk.
The effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Groups senior management.
The Ashmore Group Risk Management and Control department and the Groups Risk and Compliance Committee RCC are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition as a regulated business the Group is responsible for maintaining appropriate capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, including the development of an internal capital adequacy assessment process ICAAP, based upon the Financial Services Authoritys methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive.
Pillar III disclosures in connection with the ICAAP can be found on our website at www.
Credit risk The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.

trade and other receivables at amortised cost Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old.
Fee debtors arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
available-for-sale financial assets Such assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity instruments in seeded funds.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are liquid short-term deposits with banks which have credit ratings ranging from A to A as at 30 June 2009 2008: AAto A1.
financial assets and liabilities held at fair value Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments with positive and negative fair values.

The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2009, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 2.3 million higher lower 2008: 1.8 million higher lower, mainly as a result of higher lower interest on average cash balances.

4.5 5 5 The Groups revenue is almost entirely denominated in US Dollars, while the Groups cost base is largely Sterling-based.
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$ exchange rate.
The Groups policy is to hedge this net foreign exchange exposure by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and options for up to two years forward.
The Group also sells US Dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.
At 30 June 2009, if the US Dollar had strengthened weakened by 10 cents against Sterling with all other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would have increased decreased by 15.1 million 10.8 million respectively 2008: 6.9 million 6.2 million.
The Group also holds a small number of seed capital investments, as shown on the balance sheet, which are denominated in Brazilian Real or US Dollars.
Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk.
At 30 June 2009, if the Brazilian Real and US Dollar had, in aggregate, strengthened weakened by 1 per cent against Sterling with all other variables held constant, net assets and net revenue for the year would have increased decreased by 0.3 million 0.3 million 2008: 0.1 million 0.2 million.
price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Groups direct exposure to price risk is in respect of the seed capital investments it holds on its balance sheet.
These can be either debt or equity instruments, where the Groups exposure is restricted to the carrying value of the assets or liabilities.
At 30 June 2009, a 5 per cent movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a 2.0 million 2008: 0.8 million impact on net assets net revenue.
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Groups AuM and its associated management and performance fees.
These are diversified across a range of investment themes and not correlated to any single market indices in emerging markets.
Based on the year-end assets under management of U$$24.9 billion, and a sensible medium-term average net management fee rate of 1 per cent, a 5 per cent movement in assets under management would have a US$12.5 million impact in management fee revenues.
However, the profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the reduction in the variable compensation paid to employees.
Performance fee revenues could be reduced to nil in severe market conditions, though as with management fees there would also be an associated positive impact on costs.

Financial year ending 30 June 2010 forward foreign exchange contracts These were not designated as hedges at inception, and as such have been valued at the year-end rate of GBP1:1.6458USD with the mark-to-market impact already having been recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
This loss will be offset by either gains on management fees as they crystallise, or hedge contracts as they mature, during the next financial year.

A net unrealised gain arising on these contracts of 0.4 million 2008: nil has been recognised in the Consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2009, being the movement in the time value of the options between the date that they were entered into and the year end.
The intrinsic value of the options will be recognised directly in equity as long as the hedges are assessed as being highly effective, and recognised in the income statement as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise.

Dolomite is an emerging markets focused fund-of-funds manager and independent advisor on emerging market investments based in New York and had approximately US$0.1 billion of assets under management at 30 June 2009.
In the eight months to 30 June 2009 the subsidiary contributed net revenue of 0.4 million.
Its profit before tax contribution for the same period was negligible.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 July 2008, the impact on the Groups net revenue for the full period would have been 0.6 million accretive, with no impact on the profit before tax.
In addition to the consideration at the time of acquisition, set out below, further provisions existed within the shareholders agreement for the Group to be able to acquire the remaining equity of Dolomite Capital Limited, using call and put options.
The value of both types of options was capped and was based on the performance of the underlying business.
The Group restructured its US operations in June 2009, to enable us to consolidate the team with our existing staff and grow our overall Ashmore marketing and distribution presence in the United States.
As part of this restructure Dolomite became a wholly-owned subsidiary, for no additional consideration, resulting in the cancellation of the put and call options.
