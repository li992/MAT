e Pledged assets At year-end, the net book value of assets pledged as collateral for secured loans was 262.6m 2008: 257.9m.

f Impairment In 2009 the Group recorded an impairment charge of 0.9m within administrative expenses in relation to land in India based on an external valuation.
For 2008, the Group recorded an impairment charge of 15.1m within administrative expenses as shown in note 8 and comprises a charge relating to property, plant and equipment.
The impairment charge comprised 7.7m for 6 hotels in the UK and US and land in India and 7.4m relating to the Sunnyvale development.
The 2008 impairment charge and the estimated recoverable amount was based on the properties value in use, determined using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.5%.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating unit CGU.
The CGUs are individual hotels.
The carrying value of individual hotels was compared to the recoverable amount of the hotels, which was predominantly based on value-in-use.
For 2009, where indicators of impairment were present, the Group estimated value-in-use using a discounted cash flow model, based on future trading performance expected by management.
The underlying basis for the impairment model involves each hotels projected cash flow for the financial year ending 31 December 2010, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions in respect of revenue growth principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth and major expense lines.
For those hotels that showed value in use approximating to book value, the Directors sought guidance on value through a registered independent appraiser with an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in location and category of the hotel being valued.
As a result of the analysis, the Board concluded that no impairment was required for 2009.
Key assumptions used by the external appraisers The key assumptions used were: Pre-tax discount rate The discount rate is based on the country in which the hotel is located and adjusted for risks associated with the hotel.
Discount rates ranged from 10.0% to 14.5% in the United States, 10.0% to 13.0% in Europe, 7.0% to 14.0% in Asia and, 8.75% to 14.5% in New Zealand.
Revenue growth The revenue annual compound growth rates ranged from 2.7% to 18.8% in the United States, 1.4% to 9.0% in Europe, 3.9% to 6.9% in Asia and, 0.7% to 6.1% in New Zealand.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and revenue growth assumptions.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonable possible change in a single factor could result in impairment in a small number of our hotels in the UK provinces and Regional US as their fair value currently exceeds their carrying value only by a small percentage.
