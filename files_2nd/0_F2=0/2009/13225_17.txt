At 31 December 2009 Treasury shares represent 1,576,498 ordinary shares of the Group that were acquired for the purposes of the Groups employee share option plans and the share buyback programme.
During the period, 627,258 shares were purchased in the open market and an additional 4,373,502 of treasury shares held by the Group were utilised to satisfy the exercise of share awards by employees.
As at 22 March 2010, 1,076,498 treasury shares were held.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate from historic cost to fair value at the time of the acquisition of the outstanding 58% interest on 19 April 2006.
The increase of 0.5 million in the historic cost to fair value arises at the time of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in REBC on 31 December 2009.
Other reserves include 37.9 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken on 14 October 2008, 6.5 million relating to merger reserves and 0.1 million to the redemption of preference shares partly offset by 29.2 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken in 2003. b On 14 October 2008, the Group entered into a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement.
As a result of the Scheme of Arrangement shares in Regus Group plc were cancelled and shares in the new Group holding company, Regus plc, were issued on the basis of one Regus plc share nominal value one pence for one share previously held in Regus Group plc nominal value five pence.
As a result the shareholders of Regus Group plc became the shareholders of Regus plc.
The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and consequently the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.
