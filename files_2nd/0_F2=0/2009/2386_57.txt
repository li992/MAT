Disposals and impairment continued Disposals As part of the strategy to upgrade the quality of its asset portfolio, the group has an active programme to dispose of non-strategic assets.
In the normal course of business in any particular year, the group may sell interests in exploration and production properties, service stations and pipeline interests as well as non-core businesses.
The group may also dispose of other assets, such as refineries, when this meets strategic objectives.
Exploration and Production The group divested interests in a number of oil and natural gas properties in all three years.
In 2009, the major transactions were the sale of BP West Java Limited in Indonesia, the sale of our 49.9% interest in Kazakhstan Pipeline Ventures LLC and the sale of our 46% stake in LukArco, all of which resulted in gains.
We also exchanged interests in a number of fields in the North Sea with BG Group plc.
There were no significant disposals in 2008.
During 2007, the major transactions were the disposal of an exploration and production and gas infrastructure business in the Netherlands and the divestments of our interests in non-core Permian assets in the US and in the Entrada field in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which resulted in gains.
We also sold our interests in a number of fields in Egypt, Canada and the US.
Refining and Marketing In 2009, gains on disposal mainly resulted from the disposal of our ground fuels marketing business in Greece and retail churn in the US, Europe and Australasia.
Losses resulted from the continued disposal of company-owned and company-operated retail sites in the US, retail churn and disposals of assets elsewhere in the segment portfolio.
Retail churn is the overall process of acquiring and disposing of retail sites by which the group aims to improve the quality and mix of its portfolio of service stations.
In 2008, the major transactions resulting in gains were the contribution of our Toledo refinery to a US jointly controlled entity in an exchange transaction with Husky Energy and the disposals of our interest in the Dixie Pipeline and certain retail assets in the US.
The losses on sale related mainly to the disposal of retail assets in the US and Europe.
In addition, certain assets at our Acetyls plant in Hull, UK, and other interests in the UK and Europe were sold.
During 2007, we disposed of the Coryton refinery in the UK, our interest in the West Texas Pipeline in the US, and our interest in the Samsung Petrochemical Company in South Korea, all of which resulted in gains.
Losses were incurred related to the decision to withdraw from the companyowned and company-operated channel of trade in the US and retail churn.
Other businesses and corporate During 2009, we disposed of our wind energy business in India and contributed our Fowler II wind energy development asset in exchange for a 50% equity interest in a jointly controlled entity, Fowler II Holdings LLC.
In addition, there was a return of capital in the jointly controlled entity Fowler Ridge Wind Farm LLC which did not change our percentage interest in the entity.
