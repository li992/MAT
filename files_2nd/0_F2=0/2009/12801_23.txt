Basis of consolidation Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Punch Taverns plc and all of its subsidiaries.
The Groups interests in its joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment in value in the financial statements of the Company.
Investments in joint ventures are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of accumulated profits, less distributions received and less any impairment in value.
All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where assets are transferred between segments or disposed, the goodwill attributable to these assets is also transferred or charged to the income statement respectively.
Goodwill carried in the balance sheet is not amortised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Operating leases and other intangible assets Operating leases and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Operating leases Over the term of the lease Software 3 to 10 years Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties held at 22 August 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were revalued at that date and this revaluation is the deemed cost under IFRS.
Landlords fixtures and fittings include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, by equal annual instalments as follows: Licensed properties, unlicensed properties and owner-occupied properties 50 years or the life of the lease if shorter Landlords fixtures and fittings, office furniture and fittings and motor vehicles 5 to 15 years Information technology equipment 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An annual assessment of residual values is performed and there is no depreciable amount if residual values are the same as, or more than, book value.
Residual values are based on the estimated amount that would be currently obtainable from disposal of the asset net of disposal costs if the asset were already of the age and condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
A review for indicators of impairment is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
When an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
61 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 22 August 2009 continued 1 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic resources as a result of past events.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated taking account of any issue costs, and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds, net of direct issue costs.
Convertible bonds On issue, the debt and equity components of convertible bonds are separated and recorded at fair value net of issue costs.
The fair value of the debt component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
This amount is classified as a liability and measured on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in equity, net of income tax effects.
The carrying amount of the equity component is not remeasured in subsequent years.
On early repurchase of the convertible bond, the consideration paid is allocated to the liability and equity components at the date of transaction.
The liability component at the date of transaction is determined using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt at the date of the transaction, with the equity component as the residual of the consideration paid and the liability component at the date of transaction.
The difference between the consideration paid for the repurchase allocated to the liability component and the carrying amount of the liability at that date is recognised in profit or loss.
The amount of consideration paid for the repurchase and transaction costs relating to the equity component is recognised in equity.
Taxation Income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable, based on taxable profits for the year, and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or where the deferred tax asset or liability arises on an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Movements in deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
For properties acquired as part of a business combination, movements in the deferred tax liability resulting from indexation allowance are taken to the income statement until the tax base cost plus indexation allowance reaches the fair value on acquisition, and directly to equity thereafter for historic revaluation surpluses.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
A corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities.
Defined benefit scheme assets are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable by the Group.
The cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or finance expense.
The cumulative net deficits on these defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in full in equity at the date of transition to IFRS and subsequent actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Group also contributes to money purchase pension plans for employees.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially accounted for and subsequently remeasured to fair value.
The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in forecast transactions.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement immediately.
The replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiry, sale or termination where such replacement or rollover is part of the documented hedging strategy.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
63 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 22 August 2009 continued 1 Accounting policies continued Share based payment transactions A number of employees of the Group including Directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model, a beta model or the Black-Scholes model dependent upon the most appropriate valuation model for the individual scheme.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Punch Taverns plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
All operations take place solely in the United Kingdom.
Drink and food sales Revenue in respect of drink and food sales is recognised at the point at which the goods are provided, net of any discounts or volume rebates allowed.
Rents receivable Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income The Groups share of net machine income is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amount.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Receivables are written off against the doubtful debt provision when management deems the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Cash deposits held as security for the benefit of note holders are not classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost calculated on a first in first out basis and net realisable value.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Dividend distribution Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups and the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Exceptional items In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, profit is presented excluding items which management consider will distort comparability, either due to their significant non-recurring nature or as a result of specific accounting treatments.
Further detail on the nature of exceptional items is included in note 6.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgements including those relating to income taxes, deferred tax, financial instruments, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, valuations, provisions and post-employment benefits.
Management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group assesses whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These assumptions are disclosed in note 13.
Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds.
Actual outcomes may vary from these estimates.
Post-employment benefits The present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 30.
Any change in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of pension liabilities.
Onerous lease provisions The Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts: however, any changes to the estimated method of exiting from the property could lead to changes to the level of the provision recorded.
Effectiveness of cash flow hedges The Group performs an assessment of the probability of future cash flows on the floating rate notes and related interest rate swaps.
Where future expected hedged cash flows are expected to still be highly probable, the Group continues to account for these as effective cash flow hedges, with the effective portion being recognised in equity.
Where future expected cash flows are deemed not to be highly probable but are still expected to occur, the Group discontinues hedge accounting from the date of the assessment.
From this date, all movements in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Where future expected cash flows are deemed to no longer be expected to occur, the Group discontinues hedge accounting from this date and recycles the existing accumulated amounts in equity in the income statement.
From this date all future movements in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement.

The Group operates in two business segments: a leased estate and a managed estate.
Between 23 August 2008 and 22 August 2009, 21 pubs with a fair value of 24.4m have transferred from the managed to the leased estate.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom and therefore has only one geographical segment.

2 Represents tax losses which had previously not been recognised on the acquisition of the Spirit group in January 2006, which have subsequently been recognised in the year.
This has resulted in a reduction in goodwill and an increase in deferred tax assets of 24.1m.
3 Includes 28.0m write down of goodwill, of which 17.9m related to the leased estate and 10.1m related to the managed estate, representing the apportioned value of goodwill allocated to those pubs disposed of during the year.
4 Represents profit on the purchase of securitised debt and convertible bonds together with the write off of related deferred issue costs and swaps on redemption of those loan notes.
Following redemption of loan notes, 6.0m of the hedge reserve relating to the associated swaps was recycled through the income statement.
5 Represents the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Whilst the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective in matching the amortising profile of existing floating rate borrowings, they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge due to either the relative size of the mark to market difference of the swap at the date of acquisition or inception, or changes in expected future maturity profiles.
At 22 August 2009 interest rate swaps held to hedge the Punch Taverns Finance B Limited Class A8 notes were deemed to be ineffective due to the intention to purchase and cancel a portion of these notes ahead of their expected legal maturity.
As a result, a charge of 19.3m was recycled through the income statement.
6 Represents the recognition of deferred tax assets that relate to capital losses arising on a group restructuring.
7 Represents tax impact of RPI for the full year on the indexation allowance applied to the tax based cost of properties.
In the prior period, there has been a change in classification of 27.5m from ongoing taxation to exceptional taxation, as the volatility in RPI has had a distortive effect on underlying earnings.
8 Represents the impact of finalising past tax matters together with changes to base cost information in relation to property assets.

9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders after adding back interest on dilutive convertible bonds by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and dilutive convertible bonds.
The equity portion of the convertible bonds has been assessed and its impact is not dilutive on either basic earnings or adjusted earnings at 22 August 2009 and 23 August 2008.

While there was no goodwill impairment, goodwill has been reduced in the year by 28.0m 2008: nil, 17.9m of which related to the leased estate and 10.1m related to the managed estate, representing the apportioned value of goodwill allocated to those pubs disposed of during the year.
73 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 22 August 2009 continued 13 Impairment losses Property, plant and equipment and operating leases When any indicators of impairment are identified, property, plant and equipment and operating leases are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating unit CGU.
The cash generating units are individual pubs.
The carrying value of these individual pubs was compared to the recoverable amount of the CGUs, which was based predominantly on value-in-use.
Value-in-use is calculated using five-year financial forecasts.
Cash flows used in the value-in-use calculation are based on EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure.
Beyond the initial five year periods, cash flows are extrapolated using a nominal rate of 2.25% August 2008: 2.25% for the remaining useful life of the CGUs.
This rate is in line with the UKs post-war average growth rate and does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the market.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.5% August 2008: 8.0%.
Where it is considered more likely than not that a pub will be disposed within the near-term rather than continue to be held and traded by the Group, the recoverable amount is based on the estimated net disposal value of that pub rather than by reference to its value-in-use.
Due to the further weakening in the UK consumer environment and the general pub market since August 2008, further impairments have been recognised in both the managed and leased estates as follows: 52 weeks to 22 August 2009 53 weeks to 23 August 2008 Leased Managed Total Leased Managed Total m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 478.5 137.0 615.5 153.3 123.1 276.4 Operating leases 4.9 42.7 47.6 1.5 16.8 18.3 483.4 179.7 663.1 154.8 139.9 294.7 The impairment recognised within the leased estate was primarily due to the identification of further pubs within the estate considered unlikely to generate long term sustainable growth following the change in the consumer environment impacting the long term trading expectations for these pubs.
These pubs are likely to be sold or converted for alternative use within the next few years and have been written down to their fair value less costs to sell, being managements best estimate of market value following consideration of past experience and the current market environment.
A further impairment has been recognised for pubs where their expected future cash flows have fallen to a level such that their value-in-use is below carrying value.
The impairment recognised within the managed estate was primarily due to the reduction in profits experienced in the current financial period, being brought about by the change in the consumer environment impacting the trading for these pubs.
The reduction in profits has subsequently impacted the value-in-use calculation.
The impairment has been recognised on pubs where their expected future cash flows have fallen to a level such that their value-in-use is below carrying value.
Included within the above are reversals on impairment losses of property, plant and equipment of 45.3m for the leased estate and 41.0m for the managed estate, together with reversals of impairment losses on operating leases of 4.8m for the leased estate and 5.2m for the managed estate.
The impairment reversals were primarily due to the identification of pubs where expected future cash flows have risen to a level such that value-in-use is now above carrying value.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The Group has recognised a total impairment of 663.1m.
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at projected disposal values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
Key drivers to future growth rates are dependent on the Groups ability to maintain and grow drinks, rental and gaming machine profit streams in the leased business, whilst in the managed business, future growth rates are dependent on the ability to maintain and grow drinks, food and gaming machine profit streams whilst effectively managing pub operating costs.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the five year financial forecasts and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Impairment charge credit and reduction increase in net assets Leased Managed Total m m m Impact if discount rate was: increased by 1% 97.0 30.2 127.2 decreased by 1% 65.0 25.1 90.1 Impact if business plan growth rates were: increased by 2% in each of the next five years 54.9 12.5 67.4 decreased by 2% in each of the next five years 40.6 10.1 50.7 Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units CGUs based on the benefits to the Group that arise from each business combination.
The two groups of CGUs are identified by their pub operating format leased or managed and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
The value of the goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of the CGUs to the carrying value of their goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These value-in-use calculations use the same assumptions as for property, plant and equipment and operating leases.
Neither a 2% decrease in the growth rate in each of the next five years nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would have led to an impairment of goodwill in the current period.

Interest rate swaps The Group has taken out various interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Punch Taverns Finance plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A3 N, Class B3, Class M2 N and Class D1 floating rate notes to a fixed rate of 5.954%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
Punch Taverns Finance B Limited Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A8 and Class C notes to a fixed rate of 5.1% and 4.7577% respectively.
Although the Class A8 swap ensures that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes, it was deemed ineffective as at 22 August 2009 due to the intention to purchase and cancel a portion of these notes ahead of their expected legal maturity.
Spirit Issuer plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.581% to March 2012 and 6.831% thereafter on the Class A1 and Class A2 debenture notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.555% on the Class A3, Class A4 and Class A5 debenture notes.
Although these swaps ensure that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes they were deemed ineffective at the time of acquisition of the Spirit group, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39, and accordingly all future movements in fair value will be recognised in the income statement.

During the period, the Group redeemed bonds with a nominal value of 82.9m.
The remaining bonds mature 5 years from the issue date and can be redeemed at that date for 107.21% 206.0m of their principal amount or can be converted, at the option of the holder, into shares at an initial conversion price of 11.782.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment following capital distributions whether by cash dividend, dividend in specie, scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise.
The share price at the date of pricing of the convertible bonds in the market was 8.60.
The fair values of the liability component and equity component were determined at issuance of the bonds.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market rate for an equivalent nonconvertible bond.
The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity as a separate reserve note 28.
The value of convertible bonds recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: m Liability component at 18 August 2007 253.1 Finance cost note 5 23.9 Cash interest paid 13.8 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.6 Liability component at 23 August 2008 264.8 Finance cost note 5 19.5 Cash interest paid 11.8 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.3 Redeemed 80.3 Liability component at 22 August 2009 193.5 Finance cost on the bonds is calculated using the effective interest method by applying the effective interest rate of 9.23% August 2008: 9.23%.

Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments, that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and credit risk.
There is no material currency exposure as all material transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Group has no material exposure to equity securities or commodity price risk and it is the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised on pages 22 to 23.
Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Income and cash flows from cash and cash equivalents fluctuate with interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes, bonds, and bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practicable, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
As at the year end, the Group held 34.3m of floating rate notes for which interest swaps remain outstanding.
The Group has taken out derivative financial instruments such that 100% of all loans at 22 August 2009 August 2008: 99.7% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements thereby largely eliminating the Groups exposure to changes in interest rates.
com 22 Financial instruments continued Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
If the interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during the period, the effect on the income statement would be as follows: Movement in fair value Interest Interest of interest receivable payable rate swaps Period ended 22 August 2009 m m m Impact on income statement if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 2.7 76.8 Impact on income statement if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 2.2 76.8 Impact on equity if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 110.8 Impact on equity if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 110.8 Period ended 23 August 2008 Impact on income statement if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 2.2 74.9 Impact on income statement if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 2.2 74.9 Impact on equity if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 108.6 Impact on equity if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 108.6 Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk such that the Group would not benefit from falls in interest rates and would be exposed to unplanned costs, such as breakage costs, should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
Liquidity risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
The Group is primarily financed by secured loan notes, with approximately 91% August 2008: 92% of the capital balance on these loan notes being repayable after more than five years from the balance sheet date, subject to relevant covenants being met.
The Board continues to review alternative sources of finance.
The Groups objective is to smooth the debt maturity profile and to arrange funding ahead of requirements where required so maturing short term debt may be refinanced or paid as it falls due.
Cash flow forecasts are frequently produced to assist management in identifying liquidity requirements and are stress tested for possible scenarios.
This includes assessments of the ability to meet the restricted payment conditions in the three securitisation structures in order that cash can be released to the top company level.
Should any securitisations not meet the restricted payment conditions, then any cash generated is retained within the securitisation not made available to the wider group to naturally fide-lever that securitisation.
Cash balances are invested in short term deposits such that they are readily available to settle short term liabilities or to fund capital additions.
The further weakening of the UK consumer environment since August 2008 placed pressure on the Groups revenue, profit, cash flows and overall liquidity.
The continued uncertainty over the economic outlook has made it necessary for the Group to take steps to improve the capital structure of the Group, to increase cash flow and repay debt in advance of maturity dates.
For these reasons, the Group announced a Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer on 15 June 2009.
The Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer completed on 3 July 2009 raising net funds of 353.8m.
These funds will be used to facilitate the repayment of the Groups convertible bonds due December 2010 and for the repurchase of securitisation notes at a discount to par if appropriate opportunities arise and to provide additional support to the securitisation groups as necessary to assist the Group in providing covenant headroom.
Capital risk The Groups capital structure is made up of net debt, issued share capital and reserves.
These are managed effectively to minimise the Groups cost of capital, to add value to shareholders and to service debt obligations, ultimately ensuring that the Group continues as a going concern.
The Groups debt is divided into three separate securitisations and a convertible bond.
The securitised debt is monitored by a variety of measures, which are reported to the debt providers on a quarterly basis.
The Group assesses the performance of the business, the level of available funds and the short to medium strategic plans concerning capital spend as well as the need to meet financial covenants and such assessment influences the level of dividends payable.
85 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 22 August 2009 continued 22 Financial instruments continued Credit risk With the exception of cash and short term deposits invested with banks and financial institutions, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk by ensuring that surplus funds are invested with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings and that the Group deals with third parties that have been subject to credit checks, or that have good credit scores, where appropriate.
The Group has taken out a number of interest rate swaps with financial institutions to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates.
As at the balance sheet date, one of these financial instruments was held as a financial asset valued at 2.7m August 2008: one at 1.4m.
Trade and other receivables, as shown on the Consolidated balance sheet, comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers and are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts.
Management estimates the provision for doubtful debts based on a review of all individual receivable accounts, experience and known factors at the balance sheet date, taking into account any collateral held in the form of cash deposits, which is quantified.
These cash deposits are applied against unpaid debt when licensees leave the pubs, and vary in size.
The amount of cash deposits held at 22 August 2009 is 37.2m August 2008: 43.1m.
These are held on the balance sheet within trade and other payables.
Receivables are written off against the doubtful debt provision when management deems the debt no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables for doubtful debts is shown below: 22 August 23 August 2009 2008 m m Provision for doubtful debts at beginning of period 11.0 9.6 Charged to income statement 8.0 6.9 Utilised during the period 10.0 5.1 Released during the period 0.4 Provision for doubtful debts at end of period 9.0 11.0 The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date, net of the doubtful debt provision, is as follows: 22 August 23 August 2009 2008 m m Live debt Current 51.2 43.5 0 35 days past due 1.8 2.6 Over 35 days past due 5.4 5.6 Closed debt 58.4 51.7 Live debt represents balances outstanding from current licensees.
Closed debt relates to outstanding balances from customers that are no longer current licensees of the Group.
There are no indicators at 22 August 2009 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the net amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows: Group 22 August 2009 Current Non-current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 2.7 67.7 231.0 Group 1 23 August 2008 Current Non-current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 1.8 1.4 7.3 175.6 1 During the current period, derivative financial instruments at 23 August 2008 have been restated to reflect the repayment profile.
com 22 Financial instruments continued The interest rate swaps replace the LIBOR rate on the Groups secured floating rate loan notes and bank loans with a fixed rate.
The capital amount of the swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the associated notes over their life see note 21 for more detail.
Of the total carrying value of the interest rate swaps 170.3m August 2008: 106.1m qualify as, and are treated as, cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and movements in their fair values are recognised directly in equity.
The remaining 125.7m August 2008: 73.6m do not qualify for hedge accounting with movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups secured loan notes and convertible bonds, there are no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups secured loan notes at 22 August 2009 is 4,054.5m August 2008: 4,710.6m and the fair value, measured at market value, of this debt at that date is 3,397.4m August 2008: 4,087.2m.
The carrying value of the liability element of the convertible bonds is 193.5m at 22 August 2009 August 2008: 264.8m and the fair value of the whole instrument, measured at the listed market value, of these bonds at 22 August 2009 is 198.0m August 2008: 232.3m.

The termination costs commenced in April 2000 and were payable over seven years: the annual amount payable varied according to annual volume commitment, the percentage increase decrease in the UK beer market and the UK Retail Price Index.
Onerous contracts The onerous contracts provision relates to the termination costs for supply contracts that expire in August 2011.
The onerous cost element of these contracts has been provided for based on anticipated future volumes and the difference between contract prices and market prices.
Property leases The provision for property leases has been set up to cover operating costs of vacant or loss making premises.
The provision covers the expected shortfall between operating income and rents payable.
Payments are expected to be ongoing on these properties for a number of years.
Insurance The provision for insurance relates to insurance for which annual amounts vary according to claims made.
The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised within five years of the balance sheet date.

com 26 Share based payments The Company has six share incentive schemes by which Directors and employees are able to acquire shares in the Company.
All of these schemes are equity-settled schemes.
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity-settled awards after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
SAYE Scheme The first scheme is the savings related scheme which was open to all employees during the period ended 17 August 2002, with a further invitation to join during the period ended 22 August 2003.
Under the terms of this scheme, proceeds from a Save As You Earn savings contract, of either three of five years duration, were used to exercise the rights to acquire shares granted at the commencement of the saving contract.
This was done at a discount of 20% to the market value of the shares at the date of the grant.
Options could be exercised within six months of the maturity of the contract.
There were no options granted under this scheme in the period ended 22 August 2009 or in the period ended 23 August 2008.
This scheme ended in April 2009.
Discretionary Share Plan The second scheme is a Discretionary Share Plan DSP whereby options are granted to senior management over ordinary shares in the Company, at the prevailing market price at time of grant.
These options vest after a three year performance period, with performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee, and are then exercisable for a period of seven years.
Performance targets for options granted on 31 January 2006 and 16 November 2005 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 10% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 17 November 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 2 March 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 15% per annum.
Long Term Incentive Plan The third scheme is a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP whereby senior management will receive conditional rights over ordinary shares in the Company.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are satisfied.
Further information on the performance conditions of the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 38 to 50.
At 22 August 2009 eligible employees held rights over ordinary shares that may result in the issue of 203,829 shares on 13 November 2009, 33,947 shares on 10 September 2010, 882,030 shares on 22 January 2011, 22,443 shares on 12 May 2011, 295,202 shares on 7 July 2011, 4,097,958 shares on 10 November 2011 and 59,090 shares on 11 May 2012.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The fourth scheme is a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB whereby senior management receive part of their post-tax annual bonus in shares.
These shares are held on behalf of the senior management in a trust and if certain performance and eligibility conditions are met then a further award of shares is made after three years.
Further information is provided in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 38 to 50.
At 22 August 2009, 58,738 shares are held within the trust and eligible employees hold additional rights over ordinary shares that may result in the future issue of up to 14,387 shares on 13 November 2009 and 26,622 shares on 12 November 2010.
Share Bonus Plan The fifth scheme is a Share Bonus Plan whereby, at the discretion of the Board, certain employees of the Group, who are eligible for an annual bonus, are eligible to participate.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a two year period, which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period if the eligibility condition set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made is satisfied.
At 22 August 2009, eligible employees held rights over ordinary shares that may result in the issue of 102,500 shares on 10 November 2010.
Share Incentive Plan The sixth scheme is a Share Incentive Plan SIP open to all eligible employees, whereby proceeds contributed by employees are used to buy shares in the Company at prevailing market values.
These shares are called Partnership Shares and are held in a trust on behalf of the employee.
For every Partnership Share bought by the employee the Company will give the employee one share free of charge Matching Share.
The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Group and will not be entitled to the Matching Share if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares.
If the Company awards dividends to its shareholders, the employee will receive a dividend on each of the Partnership and Matching Shares they hold.
The Company arranges for the dividends to be used to buy extra shares Dividend Shares.
Dividend Shares must be held in the plan for three years before they can be removed unless the employee leaves the Group in which case they must be taken out.
The scheme was introduced in June 2004 with shares being acquired at market values on an annual or monthly basis.
As at 22 August 2009 1,064,832 shares August 2008: 351,229 shares had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.
The par value of the shares issued that has been deducted from reserves is negligible.
The market value of these shares at 22 August 2009 was 1.1m August 2008: 1.0m.

The expected term of the options is based on the life to the point of expected exercise.
This is determined through analysis of historically evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Share Incentive Plan The fair value of the Matching Shares issued under the Companys Share Incentive Plan is recognised as the market value of the shares issued at the date of purchase.
This charge is spread over the three year vesting period on a straight line basis.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The estimated fair value of the deferred bonus shares awarded in the year are determined based on the market value of shares on the date of grant discounted by the expected dividend yield.
No awards were made under this scheme in the current year.

The asset was restricted to the amount that could be recovered through reduced contributions to the related defined contribution scheme.
No restriction has been applied at 22 August 2009, as the scheme is assessed to be in deficit.
On the acquisition of Spirit group, the Group undertook to make scheduled contributions to reduce the pension scheme deficits on acquisition over the five years to 2010.
Following finalisation of the actuarial valuations of the SGPS and SGRPP schemes as at 5 April 2007 and 31 October 2006 respectively, no additional payments were required to be made to the SGRPP scheme: the remaining scheduled contributions into the SGPS are as detailed below.
At the period end date, the August 2009 payment had not been made: it was paid subsequent to the period end, on 28 August 2009.
SGPS payments m August 2009 3.4 August 2010 4.4 Total 7.8 The pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 22 August 23 August 2009 2008 m m Defined contribution schemes 3.1 3.8 Pension risk The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes which are all closed to new members.
The schemes are subject to risk regarding the relative amount of the schemes assets, which are affected by the value of investments and the returns generated by such investments, compared to the schemes liabilities, which are affected by changes in life expectancy, actual and expected price inflation, changes in bond yields and future salary increases.
The difference in value between scheme assets and scheme liabilities may vary significantly in the short term, potentially resulting in an increased deficit or reduced surplus being recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
Legislation means that, on occasion, it may be appropriate to approach the Pensions Regulator for pre-clearance of agreements reached with the Pension Trustees at the time of significant corporate transactions.
Such clearance may include a requirement to increase the level of funding over a reduced timescale.
