The table below shows the sensitivity of the goodwill to each of the applicable assumptions separately: Assumption used in Assumption causing Assumption value in use calculation impairment Discount rate 9.0% 11.4% Inflation rate 3.0% 0.6% Growth rate 0.0% 6.3% There are no further reasonable possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the value of the goodwill or any of the intangibles with indefinite lives to materially fall short of their carrying value.
