20 SEGMENT INFORMATION Randgold has implemented IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009.
Operating segments have been identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments included in internal reports are determined on the basis of their significance to the group.
In particular, operating mines are reported as separate segments and exploration projects that have significant capitalised expenditure or other fixed assets are also reported separately.
Other parts of the group are included with corporate and exploration.
The groups chief operating decision maker is considered by management to be the board of directors.
An analysis of the groups business segments is set out below.
Major customers are not identifiable because all gold is sold to an agent.
Tongon was not split out separately during the prior year, as the project was in the construction phase and all expenditure was capital in nature.
In the prior year, capital expenditure related to Tongon amounted to US$22.7 million and was included in the corporate and exploration column.
