Notes to the Group accounts 1.
Segmental analysis At 31 December 2009 the Group continued to be organised on a worldwide basis into two main business segments, relating to the manufacture and sale of the Groups products which are destined for either the Consumer Care market or the market for Industrial Specialities.
These are the segments for which summary management information is presented to the Groups Finance and Executive Committees, which are deemed to be the Groups Chief Operating Decision Makers.
There is no material trade between segments.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to a specific segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, inventories and trade and other receivables.

Deferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future.
If all earnings were remitted, an additional 2.6m of tax would be payable.
All movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in income with the exception of the charges shown in note 5 b, which have been recognised directly in equity.

Discontinued operations In April 2009, continuing its strategy to reduce exposure to basic commodity sectors, the Group announced the closure of its operations at Bromborough in Merseyside, United Kingdom.
This represents an exit from the commodity oleochemicals sector in the UK.
There have been exceptional non-cash asset write downs of 20.6m and exceptional cash closure costs of 9.8m, of which 2.8m was incurred in 2009 and the remainder is expected to be spent during 2010.
There was a small net credit of 1.4m relating to previously discontinued businesses.
During 2008, the Group sold its 46.5% stake in its associate, Baxenden Chemicals Limited, to Chemtura Corporation for 13m and its Chicago Oleochemicals business was sold to H. I. G. Capital LLC for 46.8m.

Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the UK and cover the vast majority of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds and are funded.
In the US, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme as well as providing unfunded postretirement medical benefits for employees.
In other countries benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided on several bases.
The acquisition of Uniqema resulted in the Group inheriting that business retirement benefit obligations and associated funding.
These obligations are grouped with the obligations of the existing Croda schemes in the relevant region in the analyses below.
Defined benefit schemes The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of these schemes are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Present value of retirement benefit liabilities UK - pension schemes 569.7 397.2 US - pension and medical schemes 99.4 102.9 Rest of World 111.4 109.2 780.5 609.3 Fair value of schemes' assets UK - pension schemes 453.2 399.0 US - pension and medical schemes 57.8 59.7 Rest of World 66.0 62.1 577.0 520.8 Net liability 203.5 88.5 The gross and net liability above includes an amount of 54.8m in respect of unfunded schemes 2008: 57.8m.

Retirement benefit liabilities continued In all territories, including the UK, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from the Groups actuaries, published statistics and experience in each territory.
The following mortality tables have been used in respect of the Groups key schemes: UK: PA92 Calendar year 2005 -3 for current non-pensioners and PA92 Calendar year 2005 -2 for pensioners: USA: UP 1994 Projected to 2002 by Scale AA: Netherlands: AG Prognosetafel 2008-2050: Germany: Heubeck RT 2005G.

The expected return for each class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.

Intangible assets Goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant cash generating units CGUs recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
The relevant CGU when testing the Uniqema goodwill of 193.4m is the Groups Consumer Care operating segment.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups strategic plan for the first three years and a growth rate thereafter of 3% 2008: 3%.
The cashflows have been discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 7.6% before tax 2008: 7.4%.
The key assumptions underpinning the strategic plan employed in the value in use calculation are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
The directors believe there are no significant changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.

However, the bulk of the facility falls due for repayment upon expiry of the agreement in June 2011.
Interest is charged at a floating rate based on LIBOR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency, plus a variable margin.
The margin the Group pays on its borrowings over and above standard rates is determined by the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The 136m term facility all falls due for repayment in June 2011 and is on broadly similar terms to the syndicated acquisition funding.

These swaps are designated cash flow hedges of the floating rate acquisition funding drawn down in 2006 and result in an interest payment or receipt as above based on the differential between the floating rate of the acquisition funding UK Sterling LIBOR plus margin and the fixing rate of 5.19% plus margin.
The swaps expire on 31 January 2010.
There is no intention at the current time to enter into any further interest rate swaps following the issuing of a ten year fixed rate $100m loan note in January 2010.
As at 31 December 2009, aside from the elements of the Groups debt left fixed as a result of the swaps described above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2009, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 5.19% 2008: 5.99%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Fair values The table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.
Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2009 2009 2008 2008 m m m m Cash deposits 45.0 45.0 42.3 42.3 Other investments 12.5 12.5 12.7 12.7 Syndicated acquisition funding 265.5 265.5 291.2 291.2 136m term facility 33.8 33.8 90.5 90.5 Other bank borrowings 33.4 33.4 57.7 57.7 Obligations under finance leases 0.8 0.8 1.0 1.0 Interest rate swaps 0.3 0.3 2.4 2.4 For financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
As noted in the accounting policies note on page 55, the Groups management of its currency risk includes the use of forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of the contracts in place at 31 December 2009 was 0.4m 2008: 0.1m.
73 Notes to the Group accounts 20.
Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Financial instruments Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: n Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 n Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 n Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments are classified as level 1.
Borrowing facilities As at 31 December 2009, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of Nil 2008: 53.1m expiring in more than two years, 96.1m 2008: Nil expiring between one and two years and 31.8m 2008: 7.6m expiring within one year.
In addition the Group had other undrawn facilities of 37.2m 2008: 39.8m available.
In January 2010 the Group issued a $100m loan note.
This is repayable in 2020 and carries a fixed rate of 5.94%.

Restructuring provisions relate to the ongoing plans to integrate the acquired Uniqema business with the existing Croda businesses and costs associated with the closure of the Wilton site.
Other provisions relate primarily to onerous contracts within the acquired Uniqema business.
In relation to the environmental provision, the directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.
With regard to the restructuring provision, whilst utilisation has occurred in 2009, the closure of the Wilton site resulted in a further charge in the year.
The directors view is that there will be significant elements, notably in respect of employee costs, that will be utilised in 2010 and that the balance will be largely utilised by 2011.
Based on information currently available and on the detailed plans established for the restructuring of the Group, this level of provision is considered appropriate by the directors.
The discontinued provision was established in 2009 on the closure of the Bromborough facility and the discontinuance of its associated business.
The directors expect the provision to be fully utilised during 2010.
Other provisions largely relate to the finalisation of the fair value exercise related to the fair value adjustments in respect of onerous contracts and fixed asset decommissioning following the Uniqema acquisition in 2006.
These provisions will be largely utilised during 2010.
The Group has considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is immaterial.
Provisions are made where a constructive or legal obligation can be quantified and where the timing of the transfer of economic benefits relating to the provisions cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.

No options were granted in 2009 under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme.
No-cost options to subscribe for 329,519 ordinary shares were granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan during the year and no-cost options over a further 347,753 shares were granted under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan.
During the year consideration of 1.6m was received on the exercise of options over 568,631 shares.
The options were satisfied with shares transferred from the Groups employee share trusts.

Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme, established in 1983, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over 3 to 5 years and, subject to continued employment, are entitled to exercise options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are exercisable for a 6 month period following completion of the savings contract.
As the option is equity settled, under IFRS 2 charges are only made in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2009 Share price at grant date 666p Exercise price 533p Number of employees 325 Shares under option 169,368 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 35% Option life 6 months Expected life - Risk free rate 2.1% Dividend yield 3.0% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% p. a.

Share based payments continued Croda International Overseas Sharesave Scheme International The International scheme, established in 1999, has the same option pricing model, savings contract and vesting period as the SAYE scheme.
At exercise, employees are paid a cash equivalent for each option purchased, being the difference between the exercise price and market price at the exercise date.
As the scheme is cash settled, IFRS 2 applies to all options in existence during the year, regardless of grant date.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2009 Share price at grant date 666p Exercise price 533p Number of employees 604 Shares under option 317,222 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 35% Option life 1 month Expected life - Risk free rate 1.3% Dividend yield 2.5% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% p. a.

As with the SAYE scheme, the Executive Scheme is equity settled and as a consequence only the options granted in 2003 fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
No further options will be granted under this scheme.

Under the SIP scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month.
For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after 3 years service.
The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.

The three classes of preference shares rank pari passu with each other but ahead of the ordinary shares on winding up.
Rights on a winding up are limited to repayment of capital and any arrears of dividends.
