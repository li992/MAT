Profit before interest and taxation The profit before interest and taxation is based on the assumption that future margins will remain at the levels currently being achieved.
Discount rate The discount rate reflects managements estimate of the gross cost of capital employed for the groups of CGUs listed above.
This is the benchmark established to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
The rate applied to all CGUs is the same across all units, this reflects the Groups funding arrangements where all units have equal access to the Groups treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations.
None of the Groups CGUs demonstrates levels of risk that are significantly different to that experienced by the Group generally and all have similar funding profiles and therefore the discount rate applied is deemed to be justified.
Rates of growth in cash-generating units beyond the budget period years 2 to 5 Growth rate assumptions are based on, as far as possible, published industry research Ovum 2009.
Where the cash-generating unit does not correspond directly with the research undertaken then the growth rate used is that of the nearest possible match in relation to the risks experienced within the associated market.
The rates used are further cross-checked with the senior operational management of the units in question.
Goodwill impairment Management believes that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would cause any of the identified CGUs to become impaired.

2 The Group has entered into a funding arrangement with Optima Legal Services Limited OLSL and during the year has provided it with an additional 1.4m 2008: 6.2m to fund that companys acquisition of further volume legal services businesses.
In addition, the Group has entered into an option agreement to acquire the shares of OLSL for 1 in the event that Law Society rules are amended to allow the Group to own the shares in this type of legal services company.
The Group believes that the option should be held at the fair value of 1 as the change in Law Society rules in favour of the Group is uncertain.
3 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement include investments in units, held in the Groups insurance captives.
The units are held in managed funds comprising units of equities and other assets which are traded with a quoted market price in an active market.
An explanation of the Groups accounting policy with regard to these assets is contained in note 2 m on page 94.
During the year the Group made the decision to withdraw the funds invested in these assets, the remaining units were sold early in 2009, the Group therefore no longer holds units in these funds.
4 The cash flow hedges are used to hedge the exposure to currency fluctuations in the Groups forecast transactional cash flows, principally in Indian rupees.
Details of the cash flow hedges are contained in note 26.
5 The currency swaps are used to hedge the exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations on the Groups US$ denominated bonds.
The uplift in the fair value of the underlying bonds due to changes in interest and currency rates is equivalent to the fair value of the currency swaps recognised above.
The interest rate swaps are used to hedge the fair value of the Groups GBP denominated bonds and the uplift in the fair value of the underlying bonds due to changes in interest rates is equivalent to the fair value of the interest rate swaps recognised above.
Details of the interest rate swap, currency swaps and cash flow hedges are contained in note 26.
