Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc the Company is a public company incorporated in Great Britain.
The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its individual accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UK UK GAAP : these are presented on pages 108 to 115.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosure The comparative balances have been restated in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated cash ow statement and the related notes where applicable to re ect the disposal or planned discontinuation of certain subsidiary entities in accordance with IFRS 5.
As required by the Standard, the comparative balances for the Consolidated balance sheet have not been restated.
Further details, including the impact on the financial statements, are given in note 10.
Developments in reporting standards and interpretations In the current year the following new and revised standards have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements.
IAS 1 revised 2007, Presentation of financial statements.
IAS 1 2007 has introduced a number of changes in the format and content of the financial statements.
As a result the Group presents in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The new standard requires segment information to be determined and presented on the same basis as the information that internally is reported to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The new standard has not required the Group to change its reported operating segments.
Amendments to IFRS 7, Financial instruments disclosures.
The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosure required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk.
The following standards and interpretations are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group, although there was no impact on the consolidated results or financial position: IAS 36 amendment, Impairment of assets IAS 23 amendments, Borrowing costs IFRS 2 amendment, Share based payments IAS 32 amendment, Financial Instruments: Presentation IAS 1 amendment.
Presentation of financial statements Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation IAS 39 amendment, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement IFRIC 15, Agreements for the construction of real estate IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation The following standards and interpretations are also mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.
They are not likely, in the opinion of the directors, to impact materially the financial statements in the period of initial application: IFRS 3 revised 2008, Business combinations IAS 27 revised 2008, Consolidated and separate financial statements The following standards and interpretations issued by the IASB or the IFRIC that are also mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods but which, in the opinion of the directors, are not relevant to the operations of the Group: IFRIC 17, Distributions of non-cash assets to owners IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 64 Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries, together the Group, made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether an entity is a subsidiary of the Company.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identi able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identi able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Rathbone International Finance B. V. which was effectively controlled by the Company, through representation on the board, until 12 November 2009.
The Company did not own, directly or indirectly, any of the entitys share capital.
Basis of presentation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated accounts.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the business review on page 23.
Impairment Goodwill and other intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are tested for impairment both when there is an indication of impairment and annually.
Intangible assets with nite lives are tested for impairment where there is an indication of impairment.
Financial assets are assessed at the reporting date or if there is objective evidence of impairment during the accounting period.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables are considered individually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of nonfinancial assets is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
The recoverable amount of held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset on recognition.
Impairment of available for sale securities is calculated as the cumulative loss that has been previously recognised directly in equity at the time that objective evidence of impairment is identi ed.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss excluding goodwill subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, except for equity instruments, or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
65 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 1 Principal accounting policies continued An impairment loss in respect of held to maturity securities or loans and receivables is reversed if the subsequent increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in equity instruments classi ed as available for sale is not reversed through pro t or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classi ed as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in pro t or loss, the impairment is reversed through pro t or loss.
Net interest income Interest income and expense are recognised as earned in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost and for available for sale debt instruments using the effective interest method.
Interest payable and receivable on derivative financial instruments and dividends receivable from money market funds are included within net interest income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash ows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash ows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Operating leases Lease agreements which do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets to the Group are classi ed as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease expense recognised in the income statement is adjusted for the impact of any lease incentives.
Fees and commissions Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised over the period the service is provided.
Asset management fees are recognised rateably over the period the service is provided.
Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned.
To the extent that retained initial charge income received on the sale of units arises from an identi able brokerage service, the income is recognised on the performance of that service.
Other retained initial charges are deferred and recognised as income on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of the unit holding.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: Leasehold property: over the lease term Plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to five years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 66 Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies continued Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when other occasions or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the pro t and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to groups of cash generating units that correspond with the Groups segments, as these represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitor goodwill for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash generating units are identi ed as the smallest identi able group of assets that generates cash in ows that are largely independent of the cash in ows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
b Computer software and software development costs Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speci c software.
These costs are amortised on the basis of the expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identi able and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the recognition requirements of IAS 38 are met.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that are not recognised as assets are recognised as an expense as incurred.
c Client relationships Client relationships acquired are initially recognised at historical cost.
Those in respect of business combinations are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships have a nite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the client relationships over their estimated useful lives ten to fifteen years.
Financial assets The Group classi es its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available for sale financial assets.
The classi cation of financial assets is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
a Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through pro t or loss at inception.
A financial asset is classi ed in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated.
Derivatives, which are categorised as fair value through pro t or loss, are also categorised as held for trading and reported within other assets or other liabilities.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
c Held-to-maturity Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments and xed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than those that meet the fide nition of loans and receivables or that the Group has classi ed as available for sale or fair value through pro t or loss.
Held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis.
67 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 1 Principal accounting policies continued d Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classi ed in any of the other categories.
Available for sale investments are those intended to be held for an inde nite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss, held-to-maturity and available for sale are recognised on trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through pro t or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ows from the financial assets have expired or been effectively transferred, or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity, until the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity should be recognised in the income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash ow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Deposits and borrowings All deposits and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premia on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an out ow of economic bene ts that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised within interest expense.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring which has been noti ed to affected parties.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional and the Groups presentational currency is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant Group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary financial assets carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net pro t or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the Groups presentational currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in equity within the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are transferred to equity in the period in which the operation is disposed.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the Groups translation reserve.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments denominated in a currency other than the Groups functional currency arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as non-monetary foreign currency items and they are translated using the exchange rate applied on the date of acquisition.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 68 Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies continued Retirement bene t obligations The cost of providing bene ts under fide ned bene t plans are determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the bene ts are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the amended bene ts become vested.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Death in service bene ts are provided to all employees through the pension schemes.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet for death in service bene ts represents the present value of the estimated obligation, reduced by the extent to which any future liabilities will be met by insurance policies.
Payments to fide ned contribution retirement bene t schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation Tax on the pro t or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable pro t. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises: a from the initial recognition of goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes: or b from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax pro t nor the accounting pro t, other than in a business combination.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is the Groups intention not to reverse the temporary difference in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the Consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as fide ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
69 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 1 Principal accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.
In relation to equity settled share-based payments, the fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Except for those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in the income statement re ects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
For cash settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At the date on which the liability is settled, and at each balance sheet date between grant date and settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in pro t or loss for the year.
Segmental reporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components, whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group Executive Committee to make decisions about resources allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to clients, a description of the services provided by each segment is given in Rathbones at a glance on page 6.
No operating segments have been aggregated in the Groups financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are reported within the income or expenses for those segments.
Indirect costs are allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by each segment.
Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other duciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement bene t plans and other institutions.
Such assets, and income arising thereon, are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not bene cially entitled thereto.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantees issued by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the contract.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 70 Notes to the consolidated accounts 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Vendor loan notes As described in note 15, the Group has issued vendor loan notes notes with a nominal value of 5,000,000 to the acquirer of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008.
The notes are repayable on the occurrence of certain events, principally the re nancing of the operations disposed of.
The carrying value of the notes has been calculated as 3,267,000 using a discounted cash ow model based on the estimated repayment date.
In the year, managements estimate of the likely repayment date has been put back from 2013 to 2015, based on the likely impact of the economic turmoil on the Jersey business.
Changing the estimated repayment date of the notes by one year would result in a change in their carrying value of approximately 140,000.
Retirement bene t obligations The Group makes estimates about a range of long-term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the fide cit on its retirement bene t schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from quali ed actuaries.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported fide cit of 9,413,000 are given in note 25.
Long-term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be signi cantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or fide cit in respect of retirement bene t obligations may be materially different.
The history of experience adjustments and information on the sensitivity of the retirement bene t obligation to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 25.
71 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 3 Segmental information a Operating segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions: Investment Management, Unit Trusts and Trust and Tax Services.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its performance to the Executive Committee.
Certain items of income are presented within different categories of operating income in the financial statements compared to the presentation for internal reporting.
The information presented in this note follows the presentation for internal reporting to the Group Executive Committee.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to bene t from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Investment Management 45,287 45,069 Trust and Tax 1,954 1,954 47,241 47,023 The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that re ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management, covering the forthcoming year, extrapolated for up to 10 years based on a mediumto long-term growth rate of 3% for the Investment Management CGU and 2% for the Trust and Tax CGU 2008: 2% in both cases based on managements expectation of future industry growth rates.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 10% for Investment Management and 12% for Trust and Tax 2008: 11.5% in both cases based on a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital and re ecting the relatively small size of the Trust and Tax CGU.

The Group operates two funded pension schemes providing bene ts based on final pensionable pay for executive directors and staff employed by the Company in the UK the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management Limited, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the funds bene ciaries.
The appointment of trustees to the fund is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The Group has a policy that one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the fund.
The scheme operated by Rathbone Stockbrokers Limited the Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future pension accrual for the current membership with effect from 1 October 1999.
As from that date all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement bene ts for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
Both schemes continue on a closed basis with the existing assets remaining invested thereunder.
With effect from 1 July 2009 all future accrual is based on Career Average Revalued Earnings.
The Group provides death in service bene ts to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the bene ts where possible and 547,000 of related insurance premia were expensed to the income statement in the year 2008: 864,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service bene ts is included in long-term employee bene ts liabilities.
87 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 25 Long-term employee bene ts continued The schemes are valued by independent actuaries every three years using the projected unit credit method which looks at the value of bene ts accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that re ects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2007 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2008 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered by the liability, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which re ect the different membership pro les of the schemes, were: 2009 2008 2009 2008 Laurence Laurence Rathbone Rathbone Keen Keen 1987 1987 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.85 4.05 4.85 4.05 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.70 3.40 3.50 2.80 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.60 2.80 3.60 2.80 Discount rate 5.70 6.15 5.70 6.15 Expected return on scheme assets 6.00 5.30 7.00 6.40 In ation 3.60 2.80 3.60 2.80 The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 18 years 2008: 25 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 24 years 2008: 25 years.
The overall expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the returns expected on each class of asset held by the scheme, as disclosed below.
Normal retirement age is 65 for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme and for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme the normal age of retirement increased from 60 to 65 during the year.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the PNA00 actuarial tables.
In 2008, the assumption for life expectancy was updated to take account of recent and expected future improvements in life expectancy by using the Medium Cohort projection, with a 0.75% underpin for males and a 0.5% underpin for females.
The assumed life expectations on retirement were: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Males Females Males Females Retiring today aged 60 26.8 29.1 26.7 29.0 aged 65 22.0 24.2 21.9 24.1 Retiring in 20 years aged 60 28.5 30.3 28.4 30.3 aged 65 23.6 25.4 23.5 25.3 The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the schemes is as follows: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Laurence Rathbone Laurence Rathbone Keen 1987 2009 Keen 1987 2008 Scheme Scheme Total Scheme Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of fide ned bene t obligations 11,086 74,491 85,577 9,750 54,243 63,993 Fair value of scheme assets 10,299 66,955 77,254 8,760 50,551 59,311 fide cit in schemes 787 7,536 8,323 990 3,692 4,682 Death in service bene t reserve - unfunded 1,090 1,090 1,041 1,041 Total fide cit 787 8,626 9,413 990 4,733 5,723 The amounts recognised in the income statement, within operating expenses, are as follows: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Laurence Rathbone Laurence Rathbone Keen 1987 2009 Keen 1987 2008 Scheme Scheme Total Scheme Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Current service cost 1,740 1,740 2,556 2,556 Interest cost 590 3,462 4,052 579 3,435 4,014 Expected return on scheme assets 463 3,477 3,940 615 4,013 4,628 127 1,725 1,852 36 1,978 1,942 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 88 Notes to the consolidated accounts 25 Long-term employee bene ts continued Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.

The fund is invested in long dated interest rate swaps, the duration of which is intended to broadly align with the duration of the schemes liabilities.
The expected return on equities was assumed to be 3.25% above the return on long dated Gilts 2008: 3.25% above.
The expected rate of return on debt instruments is based on long-term yields at the start of the year, with an adjustment for the risk of default and future downgrade in relation to corporate bonds.
Cash has been assumed to generate a similar return to short dated government bonds.
The statement of investment principles set by the trustees requires that the assets of the scheme are invested in a balanced portfolio in the following sectors and proportions: Laurence Keen Scheme Rathbone 1987 Scheme UK equities 35% 55% 43% 57% Overseas equities 0% 20% 21% 35% Fixed interest stocks 45% 65% 14% 28% Cash deposits 45% 65% 0% 8% The total allocation of assets in the Laurence Keen Scheme to xed interest stocks and cash deposits is expressed as a combined percentage of the two asset classes in the statement of investment principles.
In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, not more than 80% of the assets may be held in equities.
A maximum of 5% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 5% of total equity assets can be invested in hedge funds.
In the Laurence Keen Scheme, not more than 55% of the assets may be held in equities.

After 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the Group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 420,000 2008: 455,000.
Additional lump sum contributions of 20,000 were paid in 2009 2008: nil.
Annual contributions of 420,000 will continue to be made to the Laurence Keen Scheme.
Following the 2008 triennial valuation further annual contributions of 336,000 will also be made from 2010 until 2017.
As the scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 October 1999, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

Employees can contribute up to 125 per month to acquire shares which are acquired twice a year at the end of six month accumulation periods.
The Group currently matches employee contributions on a one-for-one basis to acquire matching shares.
The Group also provides performance-related free shares, with eligible employees receiving shares valued at the rate of 100 per 1% real increase in EPS up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum.
For UK employees, SIP dividends are reinvested and used to purchase shares whilst for overseas employees, dividends are paid in cash.
As at 31 December 2009, the trustees of the SIP held 1,356,417 2008: 1,290,392 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 10,851,336 2008: 10,755,417.

Long-term incentive plan Details of the general terms of the long-term incentive plan LTIP are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 36 to 43.
In March 2009, the trustees of the plan elected to settle substantially all of the 2006 08 award in cash as an alternative to shares following changes to capital gains tax rules.
As a consequence of this, the Group changed the basis of accounting for the awards under the LTIP to treat them as cash settled rather than equity settled with effect from 31 March 2009.
At the year end, a liability of 119,000 has been recognised for the estimated fair value of future awards.
At 31 December 2009, the trustees of the LTIP held 42,693 2008: 47,193 ordinary shares of 5p each in in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 341,544 2008: 393,354.

Savings related share option plan During the year, the Group established an HM Revenue & Customs approved savings related share option plan save as you earn.
Under the scheme, employees can contribute up to 250 per month to acquire shares at the end of the three year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees can elect to acquire shares or receive their savings, including interest, in cash.
Further information on the scheme is given in the Remuneration report on page 40.
Share option scheme The Company has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group.
Under the scheme, certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company at prices ranging from 415p to 1172p under the share option schemes approved by shareholders in 1993 as amended in 1996, 1996 and 2000.
Options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period and are exercisable three years from grant date.

28 Financial risk management The Group has identi ed the risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Services Authority the FSA in its application of the Capital Requirements Directive.
The Group categorises its financial risks into three areas: i credit risk: ii liquidity risk: and iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash ow interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk.
The sections below outline the Groups risk appetite and explain how it fide fines and manages each category of financial risk.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks that the Group faces, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to re ect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors the Board.
The Board has embedded risk management within the business through the boards of directors of the Groups operating subsidiaries and certain of the Boards standing committees.
The principal committees that have responsibility for the identi cation, mitigation and management of risks are the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Banking Committee, which is a standing committee of the board of directors of Rathbone Investment Management Limited the RIM Board.
The treasury department, reporting through the Banking Committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group treasury manual and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
93 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 28 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds with other banks and holding interest bearing securities.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan books and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The Group categorises its exposures based on the long-term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the Banking Committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trust businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances of 4,980,000 were past due by fewer than 90 days but not impaired at 31 December 2009 2008: 6,322,000.
No settlement balances were impaired at the balance sheet date 2008: nil.
Loans and advances to banks and debt and other securities The Group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio which includes bank deposits, certi cates of deposit, money market funds and government bonds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of surplus investment management client cash, which is held under a banking relationship, and the Groups own reserves.
The Groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long-term rating of A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis and reviewed by the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
The Banking Committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate speci c holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans to clients through its Investment Management operations the Investment Management loan book and via previously Rathbone International Finance B. V. the Rathbone International Finance loan book.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk on trade debtors arising from the Trust and Tax and Pensions Advisory businesses trust and pension debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time to time due to short-term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 94 Notes to the consolidated accounts 28 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued b Investment management loan book Loans and short-term overdrafts are provided as a service to Investment Management clients who are generally asset rich but have shortto medium-term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name and are advanced for a maximum of one year.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted if required.
The Banking Committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where necessary, repayment plans are established with clients before loans become overdue or uncovered.
At 31 December, the total lending exposure limit for the Investment Management loan book was 30,000,000 2008: 25,000,000 of which 18,712,000 had been advanced 2008: 12,459,000 and a further 5,260,000 had been committed 2008: 4,555,000. c Rathbone International Finance loan book The Rathbone International Finance loan book was disposed of on 12 November 2009 note 10. d Trust and pension debtors Trust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Management Committees of the Groups Trust and Pension Advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
e Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers are constituted by loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008 and its Geneva trust operations in 2009 note 15.
Derivatives From time to time, the Group makes use of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk note 6.
The Group maintains control limits on net open derivative positions i. e. the difference between purchase and sale contracts, by both amount and term.
At any one time, the amount subject to credit risk is limited to the current fair value of instruments that are favourable to the Group i. e. contracts with a positive fair value, which in relation to derivatives is only a small fraction of the notional value of the contract.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at balance sheet date on a case-by-case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors, are set out in note 15.
No other impairment losses arose in the year 2008: none.

The Banking Committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in the light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moodys rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to speci c banks or banks within a particular country or sector.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
The treasury department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Groups liquidity policy, which requires that Rathbone Investment Management the Bank maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
Liquidity mismatches are monitored on a daily basis against the liquidity limits set by the Banking Committee and the FSAs liquidity mismatch guidelines.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The Group operates a strict set of criteria for counterparties to ensure that investments are liquid and are with high quality counterparties, fide ned as those who have been awarded a long-term rating of A or above by Fitch or equivalent by Moodys.
The Group does not rely on external funding for its activities.
Current market conditions have resulted in an increase in the level of liquidity in investment management clients portfolios as investment managers position assets more defensively.
Consequently, the Group is increasingly a net provider of liquidity to the banking markets.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups principal exposure to cash ow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the Groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity pro le of the Groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the Banking Committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is rising and shortens it when the yield curve is falling.

The potential total pro t or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest bearing assets.
At 31 December 2009, the Bank had 738.5 million 2008: 993.4 million of sterling interest bearing liabilities averaging two days 2008: four days to repricing which were matched by sterling assets averaging 74 days 2008: 52 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 72 days 2008: 48 days.
The total potential impact on pro t after tax and equity was 2,088,000 2008: 1,894,000 at the balance sheet date for a 2% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The Group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2009 2008: none.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 102 Notes to the consolidated accounts 28 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued Foreign exchange risk The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and signi cant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time to time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Groups structural currency exposure was substantially eliminated on the disposal of its Switzerland, Singapore, British Virgin Islands and Dutch operations during the year note 10.
The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2009.
Included in the table are the Groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or Euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
103 Notes to the consolidated accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 28 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 16.
At 31 December 2009, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 2,931,000 2008: 2,991,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 293,000 2008: 299,000 : there would be no impact on pro t after tax.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment securities note 18.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either direc tly or indirectly Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2009 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities equity securities 2,153 779 2,932 money market funds 84,000 84,000 Total financial assets 2,153 84,779 86,932 There have been no transfers between levels during the year.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
29 Capital management Accounting capital is fide ned as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves.
Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is a requirement of the Capital Requirements Directive.
The ICAAP draws on the Groups Risk Management process which is embedded within the individual businesses, function heads and executive committees within the Group.
Regulatory capital differs from accounting capital due to the non-consolidation of Rathbone Insurance Limited in regulatory capital values.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to comply with the capital requirements set by the regulators of the banking and other regulated markets where the entities within the Group operate: to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders a nd bene ts for other stakeholders: and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
The Groups regulatory capital is monitored by the treasury department and is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retai ned earnings, net of the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets: and Tier 2 capital, which is unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of equity instruments held as available for sale.
In calculating the capital requirement, the Group has adopted the standardised approach to credit risk and the basic indicator approach to operational risk.
The 2009 ICAAP was approved by the Rathbone Brothers Plc Board in February 2010.
There have been no capital requirement breaches during the course of the year.
