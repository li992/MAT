NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4. criticaL accountinG JuDGementS anD eStimateS continued Carrying value of property, plant and equipment The Groups accounting policy for property, plant and equipment assets is set out in note 2.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 March 2009 was 2,774.2m.
In the year ended 31 March 2009 additions totalled 239.8m and the depreciation charge was 133.5m.
Estimated useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are based on managements judgement and experience.
When management identifies that actual useful lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively.
Due to the significance of capital investment to the Group, variations between actual and estimated useful lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively.
Historically, only minor changes to estimated useful lives have been required.
Defined benefit pension schemes Directors best estimates are based upon an assessment, with advice from the schemes actuaries, of key financial and demographic assumptions.
The rate used to discount schemes liabilities reflects the market rate for long-term corporate bonds, adjusted for the projected duration of liabilities.
Inflation is based upon the market rate observed at 31 March by reference to long-term index-linked bonds.
Mortality assumptions are set upon actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics using a medium cohort basis and schemespecific experience.
A schedule showing the impact upon the schemes liabilities of any change in the assumption made is included in note 28 to these financial statements.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue at the time of delivery of services.
Payments received in advance of services delivered are recorded as a liability.
South West Water raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the Periodic Review price-setting process.
For water and waste water customers with water meters, revenue recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the financial year-end.
Estimated usage is based on historic data, judgement and assumptions: actual results could differ from these estimates which would result in operating revenue being adjusted in the period in which the revision of the estimates is determined.
Provision for doubtful debts At each balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records provisions for doubtful debts based on experience including comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history.
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery and could impact future operating results positively or negatively.
As at 31 March 2009 the Groups current trade receivables were 154.9m, against which 43.1m was provided for impairment.
Impairment of intangible assets The Group records all assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value.
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, are assessed at least annually for impairment.
The initial goodwill recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make estimations of future cash flows, terminal values and an assessment of the long-term pre-tax discount rate to be applied to those cash flows which reflects an assessment of the cost of capital of the cash-generating unit.
