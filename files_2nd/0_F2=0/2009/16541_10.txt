Higher volumes contributed positively to EBITDA by c. US$130 million whilst lower LME prices reduced EBITDA by c. US$850 million.
Exploration Ongoing exploration activities at HZL have yielded signi cant success with the gross addition of 46.3 million tonnes to reserves and resources prior to a depletion of 6.7 million tonnes in FY 2009.
Contained zinc-lead metal has increased by 4.7 million tonnes, prior to a depletion of 0.7 million tonnes during the same period.
Total reserves and resources at 31 March 2009 were 272.0 million tonnes containing 31.5 million tonnes of zinc-lead metal and 713.3 million ounces of silver.
The reserves and resources position has been independently reviewed and certi ed as per the JORC standard.
In FY 2009, record annual drilling of 70,300 metres was completed.
The success of our exploration efforts has been primarily at the Rampura Agucha and Sindesar Khurd mines.
The success of exploration efforts during the year is signi ed by additions at the Rampura Agucha and Sindesar Khurd mines where we now have a reserve and resource base of 118.7 million tonnes FY 2008: 107.3 million tonnes Bulk Concentrate and 56.6 million tonnes respectively FY 2008: 37.1 million tonnes.
Projects The conventional technology Two underground mines namely We successfully commissioned our for otation of lead-zinc ores is Rajpura Dariba RDM & Zawar 1.0 mtpa stream III concentrator at differential otation to produce Mines ZM earlier produced Rampura Agucha and captive power separate concentrates of lead and separate zinc and lead concentrates.

The separate concentrates The recoveries of zinc, lead and silver are then fed to respective smelters were relatively lower from RDM.
Bulk Construction activities at the 210,000 of lead and zinc for recovery of otation was carried out after a lot tpa zinc smelter and 100,000 tpa lead metals.
In this process, misplaced of R&D and plant trials at both the smelter at Rajpura Dariba is progressing metals Zinc in Lead concentrates mines and after modifying the ow well and on schedule for completion by and Lead in Zinc concentrates sheets to suit the requirements of mid 2010.
Work at the mining projects are lost and conventionally not the smelter and signi cant better at Rampura Agucha, Sindesar Khurd accounted for in recovery, either overall recoveries were achieved at and Kayar are also progressing on at mines or at smelters.
These both the mines for all the metals.

At Sindesar Khurd the depending upon concentration the form of bulk concentrate while ramp portal is nearing completion and tonnages of different RDM produces bulk concentrate for and resources have been mobilised to concentrates for different mines.

The innovativeness of this In line with the Groups philosophy ISP existing at CLZS, enjoys the project lies in the use of Zawar bulk of being a fully self reliant producer advantages of being able to use concentrate to blend with RDM bulk of power, a 160 MW captive thermal Dirty feed i. e. both lead and concentrate to make it acceptable to power plant is also being built zinc in the feed to the furnace the smelter.
In this process, zinc, lead at Rajpura Dariba.

and silver recoveries have improved progressing well on schedule.
Historically, bulk concentrates by 0.5%, 2% and 1% respectively in ZM concentrates containing both lead and by 2.5%, 6% and 4% respectively and zinc produced by bulk otation in RDM.
Besides helping in better at mines should be fed to the furnace management of mineral resources, giving advantages of correspondingly substantial financial savings are higher recovery at mines and without generated through this effort.
