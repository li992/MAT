The holders of Shares of the relevant share class shall be entitled to receive by way of capital any surplus assets of the share class in proportion to their holdings.
In the event that the share class has insufficient funds or assets to meet all the debt and liabilities attributable to that share class, any such shortfall shall be paid out of funds or assets attributable to the other share classes in proportion to the respective net assets of the relevant share classes as at the date of winding-up.
The Companys Articles incorporate a discount management provision which applies to each class of Ordinary Shares individually that will require a continuation vote to be proposed in respect of the particular class of Ordinary Shares at a class meeting of the relevant shareholders by way of ordinary resolution if, over the previous 12 month rolling period commencing from 1 January 2008, the relevant class of Ordinary Shares has traded, on average calculated by averaging the closing mid-market share price on the dates which are 5 Business Days after the date on which each estimated Published NAV announcement is made for each NAV Calculation date over the period at a discount in excess of 5 per cent to the average Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share of that class calculated by averaging the NAV per Ordinary Share of that class as at the NAV Calculation Date at the end of each month during the period.
In the event that a vote to continue is proposed and passed for any class of Ordinary Shares as a result of the operation of such mechanism, no further continuation vote will be capable of being proposed for that class for a further 12 months from the date on which the requirement for such a continuation vote was triggered.
If such continuation vote is not passed, the directors will be required to formulate redemption proposals to be put to the shareholders of that class offering to redeem their Ordinary Shares at the relevant Published Net Asset Value on the NAV Calculation Date immediately preceding such redemption less the costs of all such redemptions.
However, where one or more such resolutions in respect of the same period is are not passed and the class es of Ordinary Shares involved represent 75 per cent, or more of the Companys net assets attributable to all Ordinary Shares at the last NAV Calculation Date on or immediately preceding the date of the latest continuation resolution being defeated, the directors may first at their discretion put forward alternative proposals to all shareholders to offer to repurchase their Shares or to reorganise, reconstruct or wind up the Company.
If, however, such alternative proposals are not passed by the necessary majority of shareholders of the relevant class, the directors must proceed to offer to redeem the relevant class es of Ordinary Shares on the terms described above.
63 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 9 SHARE CAPITAL continued Where following redemption of any class of Ordinary Shares under the discount management provision, the number of Ordinary Shares of that class remaining in issue represent less than 25 per cent, of the Ordinary Shares of that class in issue immediately before such redemption or the listing for such class of Ordinary Shares on the Official List is withdrawn or threatened to be withdrawn or the directors determine that the conditions for the continued listing of that class are not or they believe will not be met, then the Company may redeem the remaining issued Ordinary Shares of that class within 3 months of such determination at a redemption price equal to the Net Asset Value of Ordinary Shares of that class on the NAV Calculation Date selected by the directors for such purpose less the costs of such redemption.
The Company triggered its rolling 12 month discount floor provision for each of the Sterling, Euro and US Dollar Share classes, by reference to the final NAV as at 30 April 2009, 27 February 2009 and 31 March 2009, respectively.
In accordance with the articles of incorporation of the Company, continuation votes were proposed for all three classes of shares by way of ordinary resolution at separate class meetings held on 12 August 2009 and each continuation vote was passed.
The arrangements for the conversion of C Shares into Ordinary Shares is detailed in note 15 Subsequent events.
