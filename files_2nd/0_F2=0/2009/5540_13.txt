Please see note 13e for further information.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of an operation, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been reinstated.
Any such goodwill is not included in determining any profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
The Groups licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords fixtures and fittings and short life landlords fixtures and fittings.
Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions to long life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
44 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 17092ENTERPRI.
Accounting policies continued Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and valuein-use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within noncurrent assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of selling costs.
Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Group.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Current assets held for sale Current assets held for sale comprise tenants fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Repairs and Maintenance Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, debentures, secured bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 45 17092ENTERPRI.
Accounting policies continued iii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date.
Any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted.
Hedge accounting is only adopted where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Groups risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
In the case of interest rate swaps, the forecast transaction is the payment of interest.
iv Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up Share Capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Net debt Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash.
Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
46 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 17092ENTERPRI.
Accounting policies continued Pension obligations The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The net amount recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets.
This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The net of the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees.
Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments during the year.
The new standard has no impact on the presentation of segmental information within note 2.
The standard requires that segment information is presented in the same basis as that for internal reporting purposes, consistent with the reports provided to the chief decision maker.
The Group has one business segment, being the operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate.
The Group operates solely within the UK.
Share-based payments The Group has taken advantage of the exception in IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 47 17092ENTERPRI.
Accounting policies continued Operating profit Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading activities before net loss profit on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets, interest, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following: a Exceptional revenue, cost of sales and administrative expenses In 2008 the operating exceptional item shown within administrative expenses related to legal, professional and advisory fees in respect of the review of REIT restructuring.
The exceptional revenue, cost of sales and administrative costs in 2009 relate to the operation of temporary management agreements TMA.
The presentation as exceptional is based on the fact that the cost is not considered to be part of the normal course of business and it is not expected to be incurred for an extended period.
b Net loss profit on sale of property, plant and equipment Net loss profit arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment including goodwill allocation.
c Movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income Statement.
If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised.
Where pubs identified for disposal are written down to fair value less costs to sell, the associated write-down is also recognised in this line.
The majority of the impact of the annual revaluation exercise is accounted for in equity and recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
d Movement in fair value of financial instruments The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each Balance Sheet date and the movement is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting is adopted.
The movement in the fair value of swaps where hedge accounting is not applied is shown as an exceptional item.
Tax A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the pub estate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999.
This led to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax.
As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief, a debit or a credit is recognised in the Income Statement.
This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in equity and recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income Statement.
48 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 17092ENTERPRI.
Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations During the year the Group has adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments: n Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective from 1 January 2009 n IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective from 1 January 2009 n IFRIC 14 The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective 1 October 2008 They have had no material impact on the results of the Group.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The following standards which are relevant to the Group are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some changes to the presentation of the financial statements.
The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Group will be required to implement the standard: n Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items effective 1 July 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Statement Disclosures effective 1 October 2009 Use of accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a Property, Plant and Equipment Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 18 of these financial statements.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Testing goodwill for impairment The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired.
Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of Cash Generating Units CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 16.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 49 17092ENTERPRI.
Accounting policies continued c Valuation of interest rate swaps The Group measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The swap valuation rates are derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
d Taxation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
e Other The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension liability.
However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue The Group operates in one segment, that of leased and tenanted pub operator in the UK.
Revenue is derived as follows: 2009 2008 PrePreexceptional Exceptional exceptional Exceptional items items Total items items Total m m m m m m Beer and cider sales 528 7 535 568 568 Wines, spirits and minerals sales 36 36 32 32 Rents receivable 231 231 258 258 Income from amusement and other machines 16 16 22 22 811 7 818 880 880 3.

i The statutory corporation tax rate changed from 30% to 28% on 1 April 2008.
Therefore, the applicable tax rate in the note above is 29% for the year ended 30 September 2008, being six months of the year at 30% and six months of the year at 28%.
ii On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over into other assets.
The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occured since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of 330 million as the fair value of the net assets acquired had been reduced.
In previous years this pre-acquisition liability has reduced due to capital gains indexation relief, and a credit has been recognised in the Income Statement.
Indexation is calculated with reference to the movement in the Retail Price Index RPI during the year.
Up until 30 September 2008 RPI had been increasing: however, for the year ended 30 September 2009 the movement in the index has been negative.
The exceptional indexation debit for the year ended 30 September 2009 is 9 million compared with a 26 million indexation credit in 2008.
This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.

Taxation continued e Prior year adjustment On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over, into other assets.
The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill as the fair value of the net assets acquired had been reduced.
The deferred tax liability has moved each year due to indexation.
Any indexation relating to the pre-acquisition liability is recognised in the income statement and has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
The indexation relating to post acquisition gains is recognised as a movement in the revaluation reserve.
During the year, the method of calculating the deferred tax liability recognised in relation to the pub estate has been revised.
This has resulted in a 30 million adjustment to prior year balances.
Due to the fact that the impact of the change is considered by the Group to be material, it has adjusted the results presented at 30 September 2008 by means of a prior year adjustment.

Goodwill 2009 2008 m m At 1 October 417 417 Allocated to disposals 8 At 30 September 409 417 Allocation to disposals In accordance with IAS 36, due to the increased level of disposals goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of the disposal to operations retained.
Impairment testing Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment.
For this purpose, the goodwill is allocated to the pub estate being a group of Cash Generating Units.
This represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit with its carrying amount: the recoverable amount is determined from value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flow over a five year period.
The cash flows have been risk adjusted to include the impact of the reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic conditions.
The key assumptions in these estimates have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable.
Cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a 3% growth rate 2008 3%.
The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is managements focus on an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the estate through churn and capital expenditure whilst remaining focused on meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.
60 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 17092ENTERPRI.
Goodwill continued The discount rate is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital WACC which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows.
In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted by using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at the year end date.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2009 was 8% 2008 8%.
As of 30 September 2009, the pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 10% before any impairment would be required.
Management have considered the volatility within the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and a reduction of 3% in the growth rate of cash flows would result in no impairment.
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.

Property, plant and equipment continued The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by Humberts Leisure Limited 2,062 pubs.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by the Head of Estates.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers.
This review ensured that the results are consistent.
A representative sample of the pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited Unique has been valued by Christie & Co. 200 pubs.
The methods of this valuation have been applied across the rest of the Unique estate on a pub by pub basis in line with the requirements of the securitisation.
The results of both the Unique and Enterprise valuations are also compared, ensuring consistency.
During the year Christie & Co. and Humberts Leisure Limited included a Red Book Guidance Note 5 disclosure in their valuation, which requires the valuer to draw attention to uncertainty in the market which may have a material effect on the valuation.
Christie & Co. and Humberts Leisure Limited state they have used valuer judgement to interpret the most recent available evidence and current market sentiments to arrive at their valuation, however caution that in present economic circumstances the shelf life of any valuation report is reduced.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are held at fair value less costs to sell.
This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: Licensed land and buildings m At 30 September 2009 Cost 4,018 Accumulated depreciation 36 Net book value 3,982 At 30 September 2008 Cost 4,204 Accumulated depreciation 39 Net book value 4,165 The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2009 was 232 million 2008 257 million.

Trade and other receivables continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Groups objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2009 the value of collateral is 31 million 2008 31 million.
This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by licensees.

The maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest rate swaps classified as financial assets.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair values The debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, independent valuers.
Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates.
The finance lease payables are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
Interest rate swaps are held at fair value and finance lease payables represents the present value of future minimum lease payments.
Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables: however, there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.
Cash balances include 65 million held within a securitised Reserve Account.
Withdrawals can only be made from this account with the consent of the securitised Trustee.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 67 17092ENTERPRI.
Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate swaps On 29 September 2006 the Group designated the 350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39.
This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until September 2011.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge recognised in the Income Statement.
All of the Groups swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows: 2009 2008 m m At 1 October 19 13 Fair value movements: ineffective portion and swaps not designated as effective hedges recognised in Income Statement 34 1 effective portion recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve 22 5 At 30 September 75 19 Financial instruments and risk The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds, securitised bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Groups sources of finance.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank loans, debentures and securitised debt.
This objective is achieved through the following processes: n Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function n Regular review of the Groups debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile n Maintenance of undrawn bank facilities At 30 September 2009, the nominal value of the Companys borrowings excluding interest rate swaps and finance lease payables comprised: 2009 2008 Bank borrowings 25% 27% Corporate bonds 32% 31% Securitised bonds 43% 42% 68 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 17092ENTERPRI.

The Liquidity Facility is available to meet certain payment obligations falling due in the Unique securitisation to the extent that insufficient funds are received to meet such payments.
The Liquidity Facility is due for renewal on 30 September 2010.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows its debenture and bonds except for the A2N bonds at a fixed rate.
Bank debt and the A2N bonds are borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate.
The Groups objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps acquired by Group companies.
At 30 September 2009, the Groups borrowings were 92% fixed after including the impact of interest rate swaps with an average interest rate of 6.5% for 10 years 2008 89% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 10 years.
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments fluctuates with changes in interest rates.
The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies.
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and secured bonds.
The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2009 is Property, Plant and Equipment 5,310 million 2008 5,832 million, operating lease premiums 15 million 2008 18 million and pubs held for sale 43 million 2008 11 million.

Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after a period of five years.
Matching shares were awarded in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme.
Details of the number of matching shares held in trust during the year are as follows: 2009 2008 Outstanding beginning of year 152,371 115,172 Granted 291,101 51,511 Vested 69,359 3,110 Forfeited expired 5,700 11,202 Outstanding at end of year 368,413 152,371 Weighted average remaining contractual life 1.9 years 1.1 years Employee Share Option Scheme The ESOS is open to all employees.
Share options are awarded to employees at the discretion of the Board.
The current intention of the Board is to issue options with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share at grant date.
Options will normally vest after three years if an employee remains in service and if EPS or EBITDA growth targets are met.
For options granted during the years ended 30 September 2006 and 2007 options will only vest in full if the average compound annual percentage growth in adjusted EPS between the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date is 8.33%.
For options granted during the year ended 30 September 2008 options will only vest if aggregate EDITDA for the three consecutive financial years commencing 1 October 2008 is more than 1.4 billion.
Options may normally only be exercised during the period of seven years commencing on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option.
Options will usually be settled by issuing ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.

All of the shares outstanding at 30 September 2009 are not yet exercisable.
The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed until after the date of the approval of the accounts.
The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2009.
The number of shares granted in 2008 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2008.
This number has also been changed to reflect the maximum number of shares granted in the year.
Where the conditions are not met the shares are released in the forfeited released line.
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the STIP was 0.85 2008 5.30 restated for actual number of shares granted in 2008 and under the LTIP was 0.38 2008 2.86.
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was 0.58 2008 4.53.
Fair value of share schemes The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using share option valuation models.
The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the BlackScholes model.
The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the BlackScholes model.
The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.

The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met.
This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria have therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.
The 2008 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2008.
Two STIP schemes are in place.
One vests equally after two and three years and the other vests after four years.
The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after three, four and five years.
