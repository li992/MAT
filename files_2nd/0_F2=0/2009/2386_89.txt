Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
In particular, the primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
During 2009, BP announced that, with effect from 1 April 2010, it will close its UK plan to new joiners other than some of those joining the North Sea SPU.
The plan will remain open to those employees who joined BP on or before 31 March 2010.
In the US, a range of retirement arrangements are provided.
These include a funded final salary pension plan for certain heritage employees and a cash balance arrangement for new hires.
Retired US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2009, contributions of $9 million 2008 $6 million and 2007 $524 million and $795 million 2008 $362 million and 2007 $97 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $204 million 2008 $130 million and 2007 $127 million were made to other funded defined benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2010 is expected to be approximately $1,000 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
Certain group companies, principally in the US, provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to their retired employees and dependants.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The plans are funded to a limited extent.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2009.
The groups principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK, with valuations being required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2008.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits at 31 December.
The same assumptions are used to determine pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2009 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension expense for 2010.

The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
In other countries we use either this approach, or the central bank inflation target, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information that is available to us.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
Our assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of between 0.3% and 0.4% depending on country.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and Germany where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years Mortality assumptions UK US Germany 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 26.0 25.9 24.0 24.6 24.4 24.3 23.2 23.0 22.4 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 29.0 28.9 25.1 26.1 25.9 25.8 26.1 25.9 25.3 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 28.6 28.5 26.9 26.3 26.1 26.1 27.8 27.6 27.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.5 31.4 27.9 27.2 27.0 27.0 30.4 30.3 29.7 Our assumptions for future US healthcare cost trend rate reflect the rate of actual cost increases seen in recent years for the initial trend rate, and the ultimate trend rate reflects our long-term expectations based on past healthcare cost inflation seen over a longer period of time.
The assumed future US healthcare cost trend rate is as follows: % 2009 2008 2007 Initial US healthcare cost trend rate 8.2 8.6 9.0 Ultimate US healthcare cost trend rate 5.0 5.0 5.0 Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2017 2015 2013 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The long-term asset allocation policy for the major plans is as follows: Policy range Asset category % Total equity 45-75 Bonds cash 17.5-50 Property real estate 0-10 Some of the groups pension plans use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix and to manage the level of risk.
The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
Return on asset assumptions reflect the groups expectations built up by asset class and by plan.
The groups expectation is derived from a combination of historical returns over the long term and the forecasts of market professionals.
Our assumption for return on equities is based on a long-term view, and the size of the resulting equity risk premium over government bond yields is reviewed each year for reasonableness.
Our assumption for return on bonds reflects the portfolio mix of government fixed-interest, index-linked and corporate bonds.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of asset held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are set out below.
The market values shown include the effects of derivative financial instruments.
The amounts classified as equities include investments in companies listed on stock exchanges as well as unlisted investments.
The market value of unlisted investments at 31 December 2009 was $2,956 million 2008 $2,819 million and 2007 $2,491 million.
The market value of pension assets at the end of 2009 is higher than at the end of 2008 due to a rise in the market value of investments when expressed in their local currencies and an increase in value that arises from changes in exchange rates increasing the reported value of investments when expressed in US dollars.
Movements in the value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 164.
A one-percentage point change in the following assumptions for the groups plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.
