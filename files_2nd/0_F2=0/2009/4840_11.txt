Net assets were further decreased by actuarial losses of 114.3 million on the UK defined benefit pension scheme and adverse movements on derivative contracts of 73.4 million although these movements were largely offset by foreign exchange movements of 122.5 million and related tax effects of 53.2 million, all of which affected reserves directly.

The increased deficit is largely due to a significant decrease in the value of the schemes assets, which reflects current market conditions but has been partly offset by an increase in the discount rate applied to the liabilities in accordance with accounting standards which again reflects the current market conditions.
The actuarial deficit of 61.0 million measured as at 5 April 2007 is being addressed by special cash contributions of 12 million per annum which are payable in two equal tranches of 6 million in June and December each year until December 2012.
Over recent years, the Group has implemented a number of changes to pension arrangements in order to address the deficit over the longer term.
The defined benefit section of the UK pension scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 September 2002.
