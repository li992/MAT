The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 and 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the presentational currency of the Group, and the functional currency of the Company and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
New standards adopted during the year The Group has early adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments which is compulsory for accounting periods commencing after 1 January 2009.
The impact of adopting IFRS 8 was only one of disclosure.
The Group has adopted for the first time IFRIC 14 IAS19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The adoption of IFRIC 14 has had no material effect on the financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards and Interpretations Effective date Improvements to IFRSs 2009 1 January 2009 IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards revised November 2008 1 January 2009 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment - Amendment re vesting conditions and cancellations 1 January 2009 IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IFRS 7 Disclosure about Financial Instruments - Amendments 1 January 2009 IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements revised December 2008 1 January 2009 IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised March 2007 1 January 2009 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation - Amendments relating to puttable instruments and obligations arising on liquidation 1 January 2009 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement - Amendment for embedded derivatives 1 July 2008 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement - Amendment in relation to reclassification of financial assets 1 July 2008 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement - Amendment for eligible hedged items 1 July 2009 IFRIC 9 Embedded Derivatives - Amendments 1 July 2008 IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 1 January 2009 IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 October 2008 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners 1 July 2009 IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 1 July 2009 The Directors are currently reviewing the requirements of the above standards and interpretations to determine whether they will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Comparatives Where appropriate, comparative figures for the previous year have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation.
These changes have no impact on the consolidated income statement or on consolidated net liabilities assets.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates made up to 30 April in each year.
The consolidated income statement includes the results of businesses purchased from the effective date of acquisition and excludes the results of disposed operations and businesses sold from the effective date of disposal.
Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from their activities, are consolidated.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or presently convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method also known as the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Joint ventures are enterprises that the Group has the power to jointly govern the enterprises financial and operating policies with other investors based on contractual agreement.
Associates are enterprises, other than joint ventures, that are not controlled by the Group over which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or over which the Group has significant influence.
Under the equity method of accounting, the Groups consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of profits less losses of joint ventures and associates, while the share of net assets of joint ventures and associates is included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
Where the Groups share of losses in a joint venture or associate exceeds its interest in that enterprise, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in each business.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The Groups investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill on acquisition.
The Group applies its own accounting policies and estimates when accounting for its share of joint ventures and associates, making appropriate adjustments where necessary, having due regard to all relevant factors.
Presentation of income statement and exceptional items Where applicable, income statement information has been presented in a columnar format, which separately highlights intangible asset expenses and exceptional items.
This is intended to enable users of the financial statements to determine more readily the impact of intangible asset expenses and exceptional items on the results of the Group.
For this purpose, exceptional items are items which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed, by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to allow proper understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period.
Although these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and assumptions used.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement of tax assets and liabilities, the measurement of onerous contract provisions, the measurement of retirement benefit obligations, the measurement and impairment of goodwill and the measurement of insurance provisions.
The measurement of tax assets and liabilities requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax consequence of certain items that will only be resolved when agreed by the relevant tax authorities.
The measurement of onerous contract provisions requires estimates of future cash flows relating to the relevant contracts and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The measurement of retirement benefit obligations requires the estimation of life expectancies, future changes in salaries, inflation, the expected return on scheme assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 28.
The Group determines whether goodwill arising on business combinations is impaired on an annual basis and this requires the estimation of value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
This requires estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 11.
The estimation of the insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims have not been reported to the Group.
Those accounting policies that the Directors believe require the greatest exercise of judgement are described on page 14 and 15.
Revenue Revenue represents gross revenue earned from public transport services and excludes payments received on account.
Amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included as part of revenue.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and VAT.
Revenues incidental to the Groups principal activity including advertising income and maintenance income are reported as miscellaneous revenue see note 5.
Rail revenue includes amounts attributable to the train operating companies, based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry in respect of passenger receipts.
Franchise agreement receipts or payments from or to the Department for Transport DfT are treated as other operating income see note 5.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
Cash received for the sale of season tickets and travelcards is deferred within liabilities and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Income from advertising and other activities is recognised as the income is earned.
Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method as interest accrues.
Under the contractual terms of its franchise agreements to operate rail services, the Group has revenue sharing arrangements with the DfT.
As a result of these arrangements, the Group may be liable to make payments to the DfT or receive amounts from the DfT based on calculations that involve comparison of actual revenue with the target revenue specified in the relevant franchise agreement.
The Group recognises revenue share amounts payable or receivable in the income statement in the same period in which it recognises the related revenue.
Revenue share amounts payable if any are classified within other operating costs and revenue share amounts receivable if any are classified within other operating income.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 47 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:50 Page 48 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Performance incentive payments Performance incentive payments made to Network Rail by the Group in respect of train service delivery are recognised in the same period that the performance relates to and are shown as other operating costs.
Grants from government are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are recorded as liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.
Revenue grants receivable in respect of the operation of rail franchises in the UK are credited to the income statement in the period in which the related expenditure is recognised in the income statement or where they do not relate to any specific expenditure, in the period in respect of which the grant is receivable.
These rail franchise grants are classified within other operating income.
Share based payments The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share based payments to certain employees.
The Group has applied the optional exemption contained within IFRS 1, which allows it to apply IFRS 2 only to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that have not vested before the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 May 2004.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Groups equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity-settled share based payments is estimated by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
The movement in this cumulative expense is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled by the Group, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
Fair value for cash-settled share based payments being only those that relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the carrying amount of the liability are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cash-settled transactions see above.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of after-tax results of associates and joint ventures but before finance income, finance costs, non-operating exceptional items, taxation and profit from discontinued operations.
Taxation Tax, current and deferred, is calculated using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profit at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement as the related pre-tax item.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax is measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends Dividends on ordinary shares are recorded in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker which for this purpose has been identified as the Board of Directors.

The trading results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquistion, are translated into sterling using rates of exchange at the relevant balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations, together with exchange differences arising on net foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency derivatives, to the extent they hedge the Groups investment in overseas operations, are recognised as a separate component of equity being the translation reserve.
Further information on the Groups accounting policy on hedges of net investment in a foreign entity is provided on page 53.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group entities at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss.
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the amount of any exchange differences relating to the subsidiary that has been deferred in the translation reserve is recognised in the income statement within the reported gain or loss on disposal.
The Group took the IFRS 1 exemption which allows accumulated exchange differences at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 May 2004, to be set to zero for all foreign subsidiaries.
PRINCIPAL RATES OF EXCHANGE 2009 2008 US Dollar: Year end rate 1.4818 1.9806 Average rate 1.6780 2.0072 Canadian Dollar: Year end rate 1.7605 1.9947 Average rate 1.8955 2.0525 Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prior to 1 May 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation ceased on 30 April 2004 but goodwill amortisation expensed prior to 1 May 2004 was not reversed.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 May 2004 is measured at the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 April 1998 and earlier periods was written off directly to equity in accordance with the UK accounting standards then in force.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where goodwill other than that already written off to equity forms part of a cash generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the disposed operation when determining the overall gain or loss on disposal.
Impairment of non-current assets Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets excluding goodwill, financial assets and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination are initially capitalised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost recognised is the aggregate amount paid plus the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on the straight-line method to write-off the cost or fair value at acquisition as the case may be of each asset over their estimated useful lives shown below.
Intangible assets relating to rail franchises of a finite duration are amortised over the life of the franchise.
Customer contracts over the life of the contract 1 to 6 years for current contracts Right to operate rail franchises over the life of the franchise 10 years from February 2007 to February 2017 for South Western franchise and 7 years and 4 months from November 2007 to March 2015 for East Midlands Trains franchise Non-compete contracts between 2 and 5 years for current contracts Software costs 2 to 5 years Marketing costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new activity are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 49 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:50 Page 50 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment acquired as part of a business combination is stated at fair value at the date of acquisition and is subsequently measured at fair value on acquistion less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to write off the cost, fair value at acquisition or deemed cost of each asset to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Heritable and freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties period of lease IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Public Service Vehicles PSVs and transportation equipment 7 to 16 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated.
The useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, where applicable, adjustments are made on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal.
An item on which no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset is impaired if it is continued to be used by the Group.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group.
Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.
Interest is not capitalised in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The Group must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.
Pre-contract costs The costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except when at the time the costs are incurred it is probable that a contract will be awarded in which case they are recognised as an asset and are charged to the income statement over the life of the franchise.
Hire purchase and lease obligations Assets acquired under hire purchase and finance lease arrangements, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges, and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income and are reported within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
Assets capitalised under finance leases and other similar contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful economic lives.
Assets capitalised under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The principal restriction on assets held under finance lease or hire purchase agreements is a restriction on the right to dispose of the assets during the period of the agreement.
Tokens Tokens issued by National Transport Tokens Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, to facilitate public passenger travel in the United Kingdom are credited to a token redemption provision to the extent they are expected to be redeemed by customers.
Redemptions are offset against this provision and associated handling commission paid to third parties is included in operating costs.
Funds from the sale of tokens required for token redemption are included as a financing activity in the consolidated cash flow statement.
The estimate of the balance sheet provision for token redemption is remeasured at each balance sheet date and is based on the value of tokens issued by the Group but not yet redeemed or cancelled at the balance sheet date.
Allowance is made for the estimated proportion of tokens in issue that will never be redeemed.
This allowance is estimated with reference to historic redemption rates.
At 30 April 2009, it has been estimated that 97% 30 April 2008: 97% of tokens in issue will be redeemed.
Environmental provisions Provisions for environmental costs are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to undertake environmental clean-ups or other work in respect of environmental matters and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated.
The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the expenditure that will be required to meet the Groups obligations.
page 50 | Stagecoach Group plc 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:50 Page 51 Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Provision for onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when it is probable that the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Restructuring provisions Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of associated costs can be made.
Insurance The Group receives claims in respect of traffic incidents and employee claims.
The Group protects against the cost of such claims through third party insurance policies.
An element of the claims is not insured as a result of the excess or deductible on insurance policies.
Provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
The estimate of the balance sheet insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement of known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims have not yet been reported to the Group.
The provision is set after taking account of advice from third party actuaries.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group contributes to a number of pension schemes as described in note 28.
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst scheme assets are recorded at market value.
In relation to each scheme, the recognised net asset is limited to no greater than the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the scheme or on settlement of the scheme liabilities.
The operating and financing costs of defined benefit plans are included within operating profit and are disclosed separately in the notes to the financial statements: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Mortality rates are considered when retirement benefit obligations are calculated.
Past service costs and adjustments are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period the vesting period, in which case the past service costs are amortised using a straight-line method over the vesting period.
Past service pension adjustments which impact on the income statement for the year are disclosed within exceptional items, where material to the financial statements.
Curtailments arise where the Group makes a material reduction in the number of employees covered by a pension scheme or amends a defined benefit pension schemes terms such that a material element of future service by current employees will qualify for no or significantly reduced benefits.
Settlements arise when the Group enters into a transaction that eliminates all or part of the Groups obligations for benefits provided under a defined benefit pension scheme.
The gain or loss arising on a settlement or curtailment comprises the resulting change in the net pension asset or liability, and such gain or loss is recognised in the income statement when the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Where the gain or loss is related to a disposal of a business, it is included within the reported gain or loss on disposal within profit or loss from discontinued operations.
A full actuarial valuation is undertaken triennially for each scheme with the deficit being updated annually using independent actuaries following the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the scheme obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related obligations.
Experience adjustments and changes in assumptions which affect actuarial gains and losses are reflected in the actuarial gain or loss for the year within the statement of recognised income and expense in the year in which they arise.
The liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of RPS represents only that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer expects to fund or recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions to separately administered pension schemes.
Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Financial instruments The disclosure of the accounting policies that follow for financial instruments are those that apply under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS3 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified, as appropriate, as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity investments or as available for sale.
They include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other receivables, loans, other investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets designated as such on inception are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where the assets meet the criteria for such classification.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term.
Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Assets in this category are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 51 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:50 Page 52 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are discounted to the present value at the point they are first recognised and are subsequently amortised to the invoice amount by the payment due date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered in evaluating whether a trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within Other external charges.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised costs, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Held-to-maturity investments: Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold the investment to maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the assets are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Investments intended to be held for an undefined period cannot be included in this classification.
Available for sale financial assets: Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the above categories.
These are included in non-current assets unless the Group intends to dispose of them within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
After initial recognition, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the asset is derecognised or until the asset is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss reported in equity is included in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss - is removed from equity and is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
Financial liabilities When a financial liability is recognised initially, the Group measures it at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability.
Financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement depends on its classification as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Financial liabilities classified as held for trading and derivative liabilities that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
Other: All other financial liabilities not classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair values The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to appropriate market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
These include using pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis.
Otherwise assets are carried at cost.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, including intra-group transactions: or Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity.
Net gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, are taken to the income statement.
These may arise from derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they are either not designated or not effective as hedging instruments from an accounting perspective.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Fair value hedges: For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged: the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both the derivative and the hedged item are taken to the income statement.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
For hedged items carried at amortised cost, the hedge adjustment is amortised through the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.

Amounts recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
For cash flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases, the transfer is to operating costs within the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the income statement.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense are transferred to the income statement immediately.
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: For hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold.
Non-derivative financial liabilities can be designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity and are subject to the same requirements as derivative hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity.
Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments, less bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Interest on borrowings to purchase property, plant and equipment is expensed in the income statement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost which approximates to nominal value due to creditors days being relatively low.
Preferred shares Preferred shares, which are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholder, or which carry non-discretionary dividend obligations, are classified as liabilities.
The dividend on these preferred shares is recognised in the income statement as an interest expense.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares, are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company, its subsidiaries or employee share ownership trusts sponsored by the Company purchase ordinary shares in the Company, the consideration paid, including any attributable incremental external costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity.
The accounting policy in relation to preferred shares is included in the accounting policy for financial instruments above.
Note 2 Segmental information Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Group is managed, and reports internally, on a basis consistent with its three continuing operating segments, being UK Bus, North America and UK Rail.
The Groups IFRS accounting policies are applied consistently, where appropriate to each segment.
The segmental information provided in this note is on the basis of three operating segments as follows: Segment name Service operated Country of operation UK Bus Coach and bus operations United Kingdom North America Coach and bus operations USA and Canada UK Rail Rail operations United Kingdom The Group has interests in four joint ventures: Virgin Rail Group that operates in UK Rail, Citylink that operates in UK Bus and New York Splash Tours LLC and Twin America LLC that both operate in North America.
The results of these joint ventures are shown separately in notes 2 c and 2 g. a Revenue Due to the nature of the Groups business, the origin and destination of revenue is the same in all cases.
As the Group sells bus and rail services to individuals, it has few customers that are individually major.
Its major customers are typically public bodies that subsidise or procure transport services such customers include local authorities, transport authorities and the UK Department for Transport.

This annual charge equals the goodwill amortisation that would have been recognised for Virgin Rail Group under UK GAAP results.
In our IFRS results we continue to recognise an annual charge for goodwill in relation to Virgin Rail Group.
Virgin Rail Groups only significant business is the operation of the West Coast Trains rail franchise, which has a finite duration.
Goodwill recognised in relation to the acquisition winning of a new franchise has a finite life due to the fact that a franchise ends on a particular date.
We therefore have to reduce the goodwill in relation to Virgin Rail Group with an annual charge to reflect the fact that we should have no goodwill left at the end of Virgin Rail Groups rail franchise.
Under IFRS, on winning any new franchises, any consideration paid in excess of the relevant fair value of other indentifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired will represent a separate intangible asset, which would be amortised over the life of the franchise.
Whilst IFRS generally prohibits the amortisation of goodwill, the treatment adopted is a result of an anomaly on the first-time adoption of IFRS that would not arise if IFRS were applied to new acquisitions of businesses.

If approved, the final dividend will be payable on 30 September 2009 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 28 August 2009.
The dividends proposed or declared and the actual dividends recognised as distributions can differ slightly due to the number of shares at the balance sheet date being different to the number outstanding at the record date.
Note 10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding any ordinary shares held by employee share ownership trusts that do not rank for dividend.
The diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares in relation to share options and long-term incentive plans.
In respect of share options, a calculation was done to determine the number of ordinary shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined based on the average annual market share price of the Companys ordinary shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of ordinary shares calculated as above is compared with the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
The difference is added to the denominator as an issue of ordinary shares for no consideration and no adjustment is made to earnings numerator.
On 14 May 2007, the Company issued 277,777,735 redeemable B shares of 63 pence each and 823,220,972 irredeemable C shares of 63 pence each at the rate of 1 B or C share for every 1 ordinary share held.
The issue of the B and C shares was followed by a share capital consolidation whereby shareholders received 9 new ordinary shares for every 14 existing ordinary shares held.
In determining the consolidated earnings per share, no adjustment has been made to the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event where the issue of B and C shares was combined with the share capital consolidation.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year ended 30 April 2008 has been adjusted for the reduction in the number of ordinary shares from the date on which the issue of B and C shares and share consolidation took place.
This treatment is consistent with paragraph 29 of International Accounting Standard 33, Earnings per share.

Each cash generating unit is an operational division.
The UK Bus cash generating unit operates coach and bus operations in the United Kingdom.
The North America Bus cash generating unit operates coach and bus operations in the US and Canada.
No goodwill has been allocated to the Groups rail operations.
The cash generating units are as follows: UK Bus North America Bus 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Carrying amount of goodwill 33.1 22.8 66.8 72.7 Carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives Nil Nil Nil Nil Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Period covered by approved management plans used in value in use calculation 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections 11.8% 10.7% 14.8% 9.0% Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond period of management plan 2.1% 2.2% 2.5% 2.7% Difference between above growth rate and long-term average growth rate for market in which unit operates Nil Nil Nil Nil The calculation of value in use for each cash generating unit shown above is most sensitive to the assumptions on discount rates and growth rates.
The assumptions used are considered to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash generating unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
The current economic challenges and uncertainties have resulted in less visibility of future cash flows and therefore created greater uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts that underpin the calculations of value in use.
The principal risks and uncertainties are set out in section 3.10 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The Groups UK rail operations are considered by management to be at greater risk from changes in the economic environment for the reasons explained in section 3.10.2 and section 3.10.3.
The revenue of the UK rail operations is historically correlated with factors such as UK Gross Domestic Product and Central London Employment whilst the cost base of the UK Rail operations is largely fixed.
The cash flows of the UK rail operations are therefore more sensitive to changes in economic assumptions than those of the UK Bus and North American Bus operations.
No goodwill is attributable to UK Rail but these factors have been considered in evaluating whether the Groups rail franchise agreements represent onerous contracts see note 34 iii.
The cost base of the UK Bus and North American Bus operations can be flexed in response to changes in revenue and there is scope to reduce capital expenditure in the medium term if other cash flows deteriorate.
Therefore whilst more conservative growth assumptions have been applied for the short to medium term, management believes that the cash flows for these CGUs can still be predicted with reasonable certainty notwithstanding the current economic conditions.
Risks to the cash flow forecasts remain, however, and are described in section 3.10.
The discount rates applied have increased since 30 April 2008 reflecting higher market prices for risk.
The discount rates have been determined with reference to the estimated post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC of the Group.
The WACC has been estimated as at 30 April 2009 at 8.5% based on: The market capitalisation and net debt of the Group as at 30 April 2009 as an indication of the split between debt and equity: A risk-free rate of 3.9%: A levered beta for the Group of 1.1: A marginal pre-tax cost of debt of 6.9%.
The pre-tax discount rate for each CGU has been determined by adjusting the Groups WACC for the risk profile and effects of tax on each of the relevant CGUs.
The Directors believe that in the case of each of the cash generating units shown above, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the unit is based would not cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

Included in the net book value of property, plant and equipment is 24.7m 2008: 6.5m in respect of assets under construction that the Group expects to be sold to Network Rail following the completion of each assets construction.
Land amounting to 2.4m 2008: Nil has been transferred to assets held for sale.
IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment, requires the initial measurement of property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The exemption in IFRS 1 allows entities to use a value that is not depreciated cost as deemed cost on transition to IFRS.
One of the options is to use fair value of the item at the date of transition to IFRS and allocate this as deemed cost.
Certain of our UK Bus divisions land and buildings were valued at the date of transition to IFRS being 1 May 2004, on the basis of existing use value by independent qualified valuers.
This resulted in an increase of 53.9m to the carrying value of those land and buildings at 1 May 2004.
Had the book value of the land and buildings not been increased in this way, the net book value at 30 April 2009 would have been less by 33.5m 2008: 33.2m.

Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited is the holding company of Virgin Rail Group Limited, which in turn is the holding company of West Coast Trains Limited.
The Virgin Rail Group Holdings shareholders agreement provides for joint decision making on key matters and equal representation on the Board.
As a consequence, the investment has been accounted for as a joint venture.
Stagecoach acquired 35% of the share capital of Citylink on 12 September 2005 in return for transferring certain rights to the Motorvator and megabus.
The Citylink shareholder agreement provides for joint and unanimous decision making on all key matters and therefore the investment has been accounted for as a joint venture.
In North America, Stagecoach has two joint ventures, New York Splash Tours LLC, with Port Imperial Duck Charters LLC and Twin America LLC, with CitySights NY.
New York Splash Tours LLC currently has no share capital but is governed by a joint venture agreement.
The Groups share of loss for the year is disclosed in the income statement within share of profit and loss of joint ventures.
Stagecoach began operating Twin America LLC, a joint venture with CitySights NY, on 31 March 2009.
In return for transferring certain assets to the joint venture, the Group holds 60% of the economic rights and 50% of the voting rights.
Twin America LLC has no share capital and is governed by a joint venture agreement.
The Directors undertook an impairment review as at 30 April 2009 of the carrying value of the Groups joint venture interests and concluded that there had been no impairment loss.

The principal defined benefit occupational schemes are as follows: The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme SGPS : The South West Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : The Island Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : The East Midlands Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : and A number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS.
During the year ended 30 April 2008, both the Yorkshire Traction Company Limited Pension Plan YTC and the Strathtay Scottish Omnibuses Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SSO were merged with SGPS.
All assets and liabilities of YTC and SSO were transferred into SGPS.
The Directors believe that separate consideration should be given to RPS as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of sections of the scheme following expiry of the related franchises.
Therefore, the liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of RPS only represents that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer is obliged to fund or expected to recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of defined contribution DC schemes, covering UK and non-UK employees.

Retirement benefit assets and obligations.
Contracts for contingent consideration in a business combination.
Financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share based payment transactions.
Liabilities or assets that are not contractual such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments, provisions and deferred grant income are not financial liabilities or financial assets.
Accordingly, provisions, deferred grant income and amounts payable or receivable in respect of corporation tax, sales tax including UK Value Added Tax, payroll tax and other taxes are excluded from the disclosures provided in this note.
b Carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and their respective fair values were: 2009 2008 2009 2008 Other balance Carrying value Carrying value Fair value Fair value sheet notes m m m m Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Nil Nil Nil Nil Held-to-maturity investments Nil Nil Nil Nil Loans and receivables Non-current assets Other receivables 21 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Loan to joint venture 21 1.3 1.6 1.3 1.6 Current assets Trade receivables, net of impairment 21 127.7 112.6 127.7 112.6 Other receivables 21 4.6 5.5 4.6 5.5 Cash and cash equivalents 22 277.3 262.2 277.3 262.2 Available-for-sale financial assets Non-current assets Available for sale and other investments 16 1.5 1.8 1.5 1.8 Total financial assets 412.7 384.0 412.7 384.0 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Nil Nil Nil Nil Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Non-current liabilities Accruals and deferred income 24 18.1 13.7 18.1 13.7 Other payables 24 1.2 5.2 1.2 5.2 Borrowings 25 347.4 514.7 347.5 514.8 Current liabilities Trade payables 24 149.0 137.0 149.0 137.0 Accruals and deferred income 24 355.8 307.1 355.8 307.1 Borrowings 25 279.5 79.4 278.0 79.2 Total financial liabilities 1,151.0 1,057.1 1,149.6 1,057.0 Net financial liabilities 738.3 673.1 736.9 673.0 Derivatives that are designated as effective hedging instruments are not shown in the above table.
Information on the carrying value of such derivatives is provided in note 29 j.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities shown above are determined as follows: The carrying value of loans to joint ventures, trade receivables and other receivables is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The effect of credit losses not already reflected in the carrying value as impairment losses is assumed to be immaterial.
Market prices are used, where available, to determine the fair value of available for sale financial assets.
Market prices are available for available for sale financial assets with a carrying value of 0.2m 2008: 0.6m.
For example, for available for sale investments in the shares of a company quoted on a recognised stock exchange, the fair value of the asset is determined with reference to the quoted bid price as at the balance sheet date.
1.3m 2008: 1.2m of available for sale financial assets for which market prices are not available are measured at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably the fair value of these assets is shown in the above table as being equal to their carrying value.
The carrying value of trade payables, other payables and accruals and deferred income is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the relatively short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.

The carrying value of fixed rate hire purchase and finance lease liabilities is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value taking account of the amounts involved in the context of total financial liabilities and the fixed interest rates relative to market interest rates at the balance sheet date.
At 30 April 2008, the Group also had certain finance lease obligations where the interest rate was at a significant discount to market rates.
The fair value of the discounted-rate finance lease obligations that were outstanding at 30 April 2008 was determined by discounting future forecast cash flows at an estimate of the market interest rate for the debt at 30 April 2008, being 6.3%.
The fair value of other borrowings on which interest is payable at floating rates is not considered to be materially different from the carrying value, except in respect of bank loans where unamortised arrangements fees of 0.1m 2008: 0.3m are excluded from the fair value.
We do not consider that the fair value of financial instruments would change materially from that shown above as a result of any reasonable change to the assumptions made in determining the fair values shown above.
The fair value of financial instruments, and in particular the fixed rate US$ bonds, would be affected by changes in market interest rates.
We estimate that a 100 basis points reduction in market interest rates, would increase the fair value of the US$ notes liability by around 1.0m 2008: 2.4m.
c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments The Groups use of financial instruments exposes it to a variety of financial risks, principally: Market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk: Credit risk: and Liquidity risk.
This note c presents qualitative information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, including the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk: there have been no significant changes to these matters during the year ended 30 April 2009.
This note c also provides summary quantitative data about the Groups exposure to each risk.
In addition, information on the Groups management of capital is provided in section 3.8.
15 of the Operating and Financial Review on page 13 of this Annual Report.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A Group Treasury Committee and central treasury department Group Treasury oversee financial risk management in the context of policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury is responsible for the execution of derivative financial instruments to manage financial risks.
Certain financial risk management activities for example, the management of credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are devolved to the management of individual business units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
i Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and commodity prices will affect the Groups financial performance and or financial position.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to reduce volatility in the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency translation risk Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument including overseas net investments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk principally as a result of net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group has overseas investments in Canada and the USA.
To minimise balance sheet translation exposure, the Group hedges the sterling carrying value of overseas operations through borrowings denominated in their functional currency or, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses arising from hedging instruments that provide a hedge against foreign net investments are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Groups objective in managing and measuring foreign currency translation risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is to maintain an appropriate cost of borrowing and retain some potential for benefiting from currency movements whilst partially hedging against adverse currency movements.
It is the Groups policy to examine each overseas investment individually and to adopt a strategy based on current and forecast political and economic climates.
The Group measures foreign currency translation risk by identifying the carrying value of assets and liabilities denominated in the relevant foreign currency and quantifying the impact on equity of changes in the relevant foreign currency rate.
The Groups consolidated income statement is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates in the following ways: The translation of the revenues and costs of the Groups North American operations: and The translation of interest payable on US dollar denominated debt.

The sensitivity of the Groups consolidated balance sheet to translation exposures is illustrated below: 2009 2008 US dollar US dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.4818 1.9806 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.3336 1.7825 Decrease in consolidated equity m 3.5 4.0 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.6300 2.1787 Increase in consolidated equity m 2.9 3.3 Canadian dollar Canadian dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.7605 1.9947 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.5845 1.7952 Increase in consolidated equity m 4.0 3.7 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.9366 2.1942 Decrease in consolidated equity m 3.3 3.0 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Only those foreign currency assets and liabilities that are directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
The above calculations assume that the exchange rates between any pair of currencies other than the pair stated do not change as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the pair stated.
The Groups consolidated income statement exposures to foreign currency translation risk were as follows: 2009 2008 m m US dollars US$ element of North American operating profit 20.6 19.6 Intangible asset expenses 0.7 0.3 Redundancy restructuring costs Nil 0.2 Share of profit loss of joint ventures 0.3 0.4 Loss on disposed operations and sale of investments Nil 5.0 Net finance costs 18.7 16.5 Net tax charge 2.3 0.2 Canadian dollars C$ element of North American operating profit 5.0 2.0 Net finance costs 0.2 0.2 Net tax charge 1.7 0.6 Net exposure 2.3 1.8 page 82 | Stagecoach Group plc 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:51 Page 83 Note 29 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued i Market risk continued The operating profit figures shown in the above table reconcile to the operating profit for North America shown in the segmental information in note 2 b as follows: 2009 2008 m m US$ element of North American operating profit shown above 20.6 19.6 C$ element of North American operating profit shown above 5.0 2.0 Share based payment charges denominated in sterling 0.4 0.6 Operating profit shown in segmental information 25.2 21.0 The sensitivity of the Groups consolidated income statement to translational exposures is illustrated below: 2009 2008 US dollar US dollar average foreign exchange rate 1.6780 2.0072 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.5102 1.8065 Decrease in consolidated profit after taxation m 0.1 0.3 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.8458 2.2079 Increase in consolidated profit after taxation m 0.1 0.3 Canadian dollar Canadian dollar average foreign exchange rate 1.8955 2.0525 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.7060 1.8473 Increase in consolidated profit after taxation m 0.3 0.1 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 2.0851 2.2578 Decrease in consolidated profit after taxation m 0.3 0.1 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Only those income statement items directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
For example, changes in commodity prices that indirectly occur due to changes in foreign exchange rates are not included in the sensitivity calculation.
Foreign currency transactional risk Foreign currency transactional risk is the risk that future cash flows such as from sales and purchases of goods and services will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to limited foreign currency transactional risk due to the low value of foreign currency transactions entered into by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency.
Group Treasury carries out forward buying of currencies where appropriate.
The Group reviews and considers hedging of actual and forecast foreign exchange transactional exposures up to one year forward.
At 30 April 2009 there were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures 2008: Nil.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk includes a foreign currency element due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the sterling cost of fuel for the Groups UK operations.
The effect of foreign exchange rate movements on sterling-denominated fuel prices is managed through the use of fuel derivative financial instruments denominated in the functional currency in which the fuel is purchased.
Further information on fuel hedging is given under the heading Price risk on page 85.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally through its borrowings and interest rate derivatives.
It has a mixture of fixed-rate borrowings where the fair value is exposed to changes in market interest rates, cash and floating-rate borrowings where the future cash flows are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups objective with regards to interest rate risk is to minimise the risk of changes in interest rates significantly affecting future cash flows and or profit.
To provide some certainty as to the level of interest cost, it is the Groups policy to manage interest rate exposure through the use of fixed and floating rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are also used where appropriate to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group measures interest rate risk by quantifying the relative proportions of each of gross debt and net debt that are effectively subject to fixed interest rates and considers the duration for which the relevant interest rates are fixed.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 83 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:51 Page 84 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 29 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued i Market risk continued At 30 April 2009, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Currency Floating rate Fixed rate Total Weighted Weighted average fixed average period interest rate for which rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 201.6 160.4 362.0 5.7% 3.5 US Dollar Nil 261.1 261.1 6.2% 1.6 Canadian Dollar Nil 3.8 3.8 5.1% 2.9 Gross borrowings 201.6 425.3 626.9 6.0% 2.3 At 30 April 2008, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Currency Floating rate Fixed rate Total Weighted Weighted average fixed average period interest rate for which rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 237.2 161.4 398.6 5.7% 4.5 US Dollar Nil 190.9 190.9 6.0% 1.8 Canadian Dollar 0.6 4.0 4.6 5.1% 3.9 Gross borrowings 237.8 356.3 594.1 5.8% 3.1 All of the above figures take into account the effect of current interest rate derivatives and also the close out of interest rate swaps previously used to manage the interest rate profile of borrowings.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one to six months based on market rates.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in note 25 b.
The Groups financial assets on which floating interest is receivable comprise cash deposits and cash in hand of 277.3m 2008: 262.2m.
Financial assets on which fixed interest is receivable total 2.7m 2008: 2.1m before impairment and comprise a loan to a joint venture in 2009 and 2008, and US$ denominated loan notes receivable in 2008 only.
The net financial assets on which fixed interest is receivable have a weighted average interest rate of 7.0% 2008: 7.0% and an average maturity of 2.0 years 2008: 2.6 years.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model.
Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit, loss or the carrying value of financial instruments that are not cash flow hedges.
The impact of a change of 100 basis points on all relevant floating interest rates on annualised interest payable on balances outstanding at the balance sheet date was: 2009 2008 m m Interest rates 100 basis points higher - Decrease in net finance charges 0.8 0.3 - Increase in net tax charge 0.3 0.1 - Increase in profit after taxation 0.5 0.2 Interest rates 100 basis points lower - Increase in net finance charges 0.8 0.3 - Decrease in net tax charge 0.3 0.1 - Decrease in profit after taxation 0.5 0.2 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following methods and assumptions: - All relevant floating interest rates including Bank of England base rate and LIBOR change by 100 basis points.
- The change is calculated by working out an annualised interest charge on the amounts outstanding at the balance sheet date and comparing this to the same charge re-calculated for a change of 100 basis points in the interest rate.
While this provides some indication of the impact on future profit and cash flows from changes in interest rates, it does not necessarily indicate the extent to which the profit for the years ended 30 April 2009 and 30 April 2008 would have differed had the interest rates applying during those years been different.
- The impact of changes in interest rates on items that are not financial instruments for example, provisions and pension assets obligations is excluded.

The Groups equity investment is publicly traded and is included in the AIM UK equity index.
At 30 April 2009 the investment was carried at 0.2m 2008: 0.6m.
Any reasonable movement, therefore, on the equity share price would not have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
The Group is also exposed to commodity price risk.
The Groups operations as at 30 April 2009 consume approximately 336m litres of diesel fuel per annum.
As a result, the Groups profit is exposed to movements in the underlying price of fuel.
The Groups objective in managing commodity price risk is to minimise adverse movements in its profit and cash flow as a result of movements in fuel prices.
The Group has a policy of managing the volatility in its fuel costs by maintaining an ongoing fuel-hedging programme whereby derivatives are used to fix or cap the variable unit cost of a percentage of anticipated fuel consumption.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk is measured by quantifying the element of projected future fuel costs, after taking account of derivatives in place, which varies due to movements in fuel prices.
Group Treasury is responsible for the processes for measuring and managing commodity price risk.
The Groups overall fuel costs include the impact of delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates.
These elements of fuel costs are not managed as part of Group Treasurys commodity price risk management and are managed directly by business unit management.
The Group uses a number of fuel derivatives to hedge against movements in the price of the different types of fuel used in each of its divisions.
Ultra low sulphur diesel used in the UK Bus division is hedged by derivatives priced from the same type of fuel.
Gasoil used in the UK Rail division is hedged by derivatives priced from the same type of fuel.
Diesel used in the North American division is hedged by heating oil swaps that have been determined to be effective hedges of the diesel fuel used with a strong correlation in price movements between the heating oil and diesel products.
The fuel derivatives hedge the underlying commodity price risk denominated in US$ and in the case of the UK Bus division and the UK Rail division, they also hedge the currency risk due to the commodity being priced in US$ and the functional currency of the two divisions being pounds sterling.
The fuel derivatives can include swaps, collars and caps.
At 30 April 2009 and 30 April 2008, the projected fuel costs excluding premia payable on fuel derivatives, delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates for the next twelve months was: 2009 2008 m m Costs subject to fuel swaps, caps and collars: UK Bus 86.9 60.1 UK Rail 15.1 14.5 North America 32.4 17.6 134.4 92.2 Costs not subject to fuel swaps, caps and collars: UK Bus 2.1 5.0 UK Rail 3.9 7.5 North America 4.3 7.7 10.3 20.2 Total 144.7 112.4 The figures in the above table are after taking account of derivatives and applying the fuel prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% higher at the balance sheet date, the amounts in the above table would change by the following: 2009 2008 m m Costs subject to fuel swaps, caps and collars: Nil Nil UK Bus Nil Nil UK Rail Nil Nil North America Nil Nil Nil Nil Costs not subject to fuel swaps, caps and collars: UK Bus 0.2 0.5 UK Rail 0.4 0.7 North America 0.4 0.8 1.0 2.0 Decrease in projected profit before taxation 1.0 2.0 Stagecoach Group plc | page 85 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:51 Page 86 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 29 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued i Market risk continued If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% lower at the balance sheet date, the amounts would change by the following: 2009 2008 m m Costs subject to fuel swaps, caps and collars: UK Bus Nil Nil UK Rail Nil Nil North America Nil Nil Nil Nil Costs not subject to fuel swaps, caps and collars: UK Bus 0.2 0.5 UK Rail 0.4 0.7 North America 0.4 0.8 1.0 2.0 Increase in projected profit before taxation 1.0 2.0 ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is managed by a combination of Group Treasury and business unit management, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to amounts due from outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk to an acceptable level whilst not overly restricting the Groups ability to generate revenue and profit.
It is the Groups policy to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
To control credit risk, counterparty credit limits are set by reference to published credit ratings and the counterpartys geographical location.
The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be low.
In determining whether a financial asset is impaired, the Group takes account of: The fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date and where applicable, the historic fair value of the asset: In the case of receivables, the counterpartys typical payment patterns: In the case of receivables, the latest available information on the counterpartys creditworthiness such as available financial statements, credit ratings etc.
In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale assets, a significant or prolonged reduction in the fair value of the assets is considered as an indicator that the securities might be impaired.
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is shown in note 21.
An impairment loss of Nil was recognised in the year ended 30 April 2009 2008: 0.2m in respect of available for sale and other investments.
The table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group at the balance sheet date: Gross Impairment Net exposure Gross Impairment Net exposure 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 m m m m m m Available for sale financial assets and other investments 3.3 1.8 1.5 3.6 1.8 1.8 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Trade receivables 132.0 4.3 127.7 115.2 2.6 112.6 Loans and other receivables excludes taxes receivable, prepayments and accrued income 7.6 1.4 6.2 7.6 0.2 7.4 Cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral 78.6 Nil 78.6 66.6 Nil 66.6 Cash and cash equivalents - other 198.7 Nil 198.7 195.6 Nil 195.6 Excluding derivative financial instruments 420.2 7.5 412.7 388.6 4.6 384.0 Derivatives used for hedging 3.6 Nil 3.6 44.4 Nil 44.4 Total exposure to credit risk 423.8 7.5 416.3 433.0 4.6 428.4 In addition to the on balance sheet exposure to credit risk shown above, the Group has operating leases with third parties that are subject to back-toback operating leases between the Group and East London Bus Group Limited, which acquired the Groups London bus operations in 2006.
The Group is exposed to the risk that East London Bus Group Limited is unable to meet its obligations under the operating leases although the Group would have access to the underlying assets in those circumstances.
At 30 April 2009, the future contractual cash flows payable by East London Bus Group Limited under the relevant leases was 4.3m 2008: 9.2m, of which 1.6m 2008: 4.8m is due within one year, 0.9m 2008: 1.6m is due between one and two years, 1.8m 2008: 2.8m is due between two and five years.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer or counterparty.
The Groups largest credit exposures are to the UK Department for Transport, other government bodies and financial institutions with short-term credit ratings of A1 or equivalent or better, all of which the Group considers unlikely to default on their respective liabilities to the Group.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups objective in managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The funding policy is to finance the Group through a mixture of bank, lease and hire purchase debt, capital markets issues and cash generated by the business.
As at 30 April 2009, the Groups committed credit facilities were 1,233.4m 2008: 1,136.1m, 594.3m 2008: 546.0m of which were utilised, including utilisation for the issuance of bank guarantees, bonds and letters of credit.
The Group had the following undrawn committed banking and asset finance facilities: 2009 2008 m m Expiring within one year 162.2 142.9 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 0.6 22.2 Expiring beyond two years 476.3 425.0 639.1 590.1 Although there is an element of seasonality in the Groups bus and rail operations, the overall impact of seasonality on working capital and liquidity is not considered significant.
The Board expects the Group to be able to meet current and future funding requirements through free cash flow and available committed facilities.
In addition, the Group has an investment grade rating which should allow it access at short notice to additional bank and capital markets debt funding.
The Groups principal lines of credit have been arranged on a bi-lateral basis with a group of relationship banks which provide bank facilities for general corporate purposes.
These arranged lines of credit allow cash drawdowns to finance the Group and also include facilities which are dedicated to issuing performance season ticket bonds, guarantees and letters of credit.
The Groups committed bank facilities as at 30 April 2009 are analysed below: Bonds, Available for Available for Loans guarantees non-cash cash Facility drawn etc drawn utilisation only drawings Expiring in m m m m m MAIN GROUP FACILITIES 2012 675.0 150.0 48.7 5.1 471.2 2010 176.7 Nil 162.5 11.9 2.3 851.7 150.0 211.2 17.0 473.5 LOCAL & SHORT-TERM FACILITIES Various 20.0 Nil 2.5 Nil 17.5 871.7 150.0 213.7 17.0 491.0 Stagecoach Group plc | page 87 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:51 Page 88 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 29 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued iii Liquidity risk continued The facilities that expire in 2010 are used to provide performance bonds, season ticket bonds and letters of credit, and we plan to renew or replace these.
The Groups US$293.1m bonds mature in November 2009 and these can be financed from the Groups existing bank facilities.
The Groups main bank facilities are committed through to 2012.
The Group also maintains facilities in relation to asset finance Asset Finance Facilities.
Asset Finance Facilities are typically agreed in principle one year in advance and are arranged for the purpose of funding bus vehicle expenditure and for specific UK Rail operating assets.
Asset Finance Facilities include finance leases, hire purchase agreements and operating leases.
The terms of Asset Finance Facilities are dependent on the underlying assets and typically range between five and ten years.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments.

Where the contractual cash flows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index in the future, the contractual cash flows in the above table have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cash flows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cash flows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the above tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
In the case of bank loans, which are drawn under revolving facilities, the contracted cash flows in respect of interest up to and including the next rollover date are shown.

Type of hedge Risks hedged by Group Hedging instruments used Fair value hedges None Not applicable Cash flow hedges Commodity price risk Derivatives commodity swaps, collars, caps and floors Interest rate risks Derivatives interest rate swaps Hedges of net investment in foreign operations Foreign investment risk Foreign currency borrowings Derivatives foreign currency forward contracts In addition to the risks hedged by the Group, the Group is also monitoring the following matters and may consider hedging in the future: The Group is exposed to movements in the price of electricity, particularly through its UK Rail division.
The structure of electricity purchasing in the UK Rail industry limits the Groups ability to independently hedge against movements in electricity prices but the Group continues to monitor this risk.
An element of anticipated electricity usage is purchased by the UK rail industry in advance at fixed prices so there is some degree of visibility of future electricity costs.
The Group expects to be subject to the Carbon Reduction Commitment CRC from 2010.
The Group will evaluate opportunities to hedge its exposure to carbon credit prices under the CRC although the impact on the Group is anticipated to be minimal.

Cash flow hedges - fuel As noted previously, the Group uses a number of fuel derivatives to hedge the different types of fuel used in each of its divisions.
The majority of the Groups fuel derivatives as at 30 April 2009 cover periods up to 30 April 2010, with the latest period covered by a commodity price risk cash flow hedge being 30 April 2011.
The cash flows are expected to occur and affect profit or loss in the same periods.

Hedge of overseas net investments At 30 April 2009, the US$293.1m 2008: US$334.1m of US$ notes was designated as a hedge of overseas net investments.
During the year ended 30 April 2009, the Group took out a foreign currency derivative contract as part of its hedge of overseas net investments.
This hedge matures on 16 November 2009.

The Group operates two Employee Share Ownership Trusts: the Stagecoach Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST and the Stagecoach Group Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
Shares held by these trusts are treated as a deduction from equity in the Groups financial statements.
Other assets and liabilities of the trusts are consolidated in the Groups financial statements as if they were assets and liabilities of the Group.
As at 30 April 2009, the QUEST held 333,372 2008: 384,279 ordinary shares in the Company and the EBT held 4,153,570 2008: 4,600,165 ordinary shares in the Company.
The trusts have waived dividends on the shares they hold.
On 14 May 2007, a share capital consolidation took place that replaced every 14 existing ordinary shares with 9 new ordinary shares.
The effect of this share capital consolidation changed the par value of an ordinary share from 12 19 pence to 56 57 pence.
Also, on 14 May 2007 shareholders received 1 B share or 1 C share for each existing ordinary share held.
This was a means of returning cash to shareholders.
The B and C shares issued were subsequently dealt with as follows: A dividend of 63 pence per C share was paid on 451,806,110 C shares, with the dividend paid to holders on 25 May 2007.
These C shares were then converted to deferred shares.
The deferred shares have been subsequently cancelled.
Employee share ownership trusts received 6,195,278 C shares and waived their entitlement to dividends on such shares.
253,584,435 B shares were redeemed at 63 pence each with the redemption proceeds paid to holders on 5 June 2007.
365,219,584 C shares were sold to Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited for 63 pence each and the proceeds paid to holders on 5 June 2007.
The C shares were subsequently purchased by the Company from Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited at 63 pence each and were cancelled.
11,409,623 B shares were redeemed at 63 pence each with the redemption proceeds paid to holders on 30 November 2007.

1,351,871 B shares were redeemed at 63 pence each with the redemption proceeds paid to holders on 30 November 2008.
8,527,488 B shares remained in issue at 30 April 2009 and may be redeemed at the option of the holder on 31 May and 30 November each year.
These retained B shares are entitled to receive a dividend at the rate of 70% of six month LIBOR, payable six-monthly in arrears on the par value of 63 pence per B share.
The B shares that remain in issue are classified as liabilities and the dividends payable on such shares are classified in the consolidated income statement within finance costs Stagecoach Group plc | page 93 66817 StCchV13 p40to112:66817 StCchV13 p40to112 29 6 09 17:51 Page 94 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 31 Share based payments The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a Save as You Earn Scheme SAYE, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and an Executive Participation Plan EPP.
The Directors remuneration report on pages 32 to 38 gives further details of each of these arrangements.
As disclosed in note 7, share based payment charges of 4.9m 2008: 6.7m have been recognised in the income statement during the year in relation to the above schemes.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS, the requirements of IFRS 2 have not been applied to equity-settled share based payments that: i were granted on or before 7 November 2002 or: ii were granted after 7 November 2002 but had vested before the date of transition, being 1 May 2004.
Therefore the following disclosures relate only to equity-settled share based payments made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 May 2004, and to all cash-settled share based payments.
These options became fully vested during the year to 30 April 2008.
LTIP awards are based on notional units.
One notional unit has a value equal to one of the Companys ordinary shares but subject to performance conditions.
LTIP awards are not share options and are valued using a separate simulation model therefore some of the above disclosures are not applicable.
Expected volatility was determined at the date of grant from historic volatility, adjusted for events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
Executive Share Option Scheme The movements in total executive share options during the year were as follows: Award date At 1 May Exercised At 30 April Exercise Date from which Expiry date 2008 2009 price exercisable 23 July 2002 286,091 Nil 286,091 0.3750 23 July 2005 23 July 2009 26 June 2003 360,367 254,132 106,235 0.6050 26 June 2006 26 June 2010 12 December 2003 567,622 313,432 254,190 0.8075 12 December 2006 12 December 2010 25 June 2004 1,431,282 658,555 772,727 0.8575 25 June 2007 25 June 2011 10 December 2004 999,635 493,975 505,660 1.1150 10 December 2007 10 December 2011 3,644,997 1,720,094 1,924,903 In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS, the fair value of these options is not taken into account when determining the share based payment charge as the options were granted before 7 November 2002.
All options were granted for nil consideration.
The mid-market price for the ordinary shares at 30 April 2009 was 1.31 2008: 2.57.
The Companys ordinary shares traded in the range of 1.04 to 3.28 2008: 1.65 to 2.95 during the year to that date.
As share options are exercised continuously throughout the year, the average share price during the year of 2.02 2008: 2.26 is considered representative of the weighted average share price at the date of exercise.

In regard to the awards granted on 26 August 2005, the Committee postponed vesting of those awards until the first business day after the shareholders 2008 Annual General Meeting which was held on Friday 28 August 2008.
TSR ranking is based on the Groups TSR ranking in the FTSE 250 whereby 1 is top and 250 is bottom of the comparator group.
The TSR ranking is calculated by independent advisors.
Executive Participation Plan Under the EPP, executives and senior managers sacrifice part of their actual annual cash bonus and are awarded deferred shares with an initial market value approximately equal to the amount of bonus foregone.

The balance of the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares offset by issue costs, bonus issues of shares and any transfer between reserves.
The balance held in the retained earnings reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the Group.
The capital redemption reserve represents the cumulative par value of all shares bought back and cancelled.
Cumulative goodwill of 113.8m 2008: 113.8m has been written off against reserves in periods prior to 1 May 1998 in accordance with the UK accounting standards then in force and such goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves.
Details of own shares held are given in note 30.
The own shares reserve represents the cumulative cost of shares in Stagecoach Group plc purchased in the market and held by the Groups two Employee Share Ownership Trusts offset by cumulative sales proceeds.
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translations of the financial statements of foreign operations.
It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
The available for sale reserve records the changes in fair value on available for sale investments.
On disposal, the cumulative changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement.
The cash flow hedging reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge.

Cash and cash equivalents includes 53.0m 2008: 60.0m of amounts deposited which are not accessible by the Group within one day.
These deposits are due to mature between 1 May 2009 and 8 July 2009. e Restricted cash 33.6m of cash as at 30 April 2008 that was not previously identified as cash collateral has been reclassified as cash collateral following further analysis of the relevant agreements.
This cash collateralises letters of credit issued in respect of the Groups insurance provisions.
The cash collateral balance as at 30 April 2009 of 78.6m 2008: 66.6m comprises balances held in respect of insurance provision letters of credit of 44.9m 2008: 33.6m, balances held in trust in respect of loan notes of 31.4m 2008: 32.2m and North America restricted cash balances of 2.3m 2008: 0.8m.
In addition, cash includes train operating company cash of 142.3m 2008: 142.3m.
Under the terms of the franchise agreements, train operating companies can only distribute cash out of retained earnings.
f Non cash transactions The principal non cash transactions were the acquisition of property, plant and equipment using new hire purchase and finance leases.
During the year, the Group entered into hire purchase and finance lease arrangements in respect of new assets with a total capital value at inception of the contracts of 92.2m 2008: 66.2m.
After taking account of deposits paid up front and other financing transactions of 20.3m 2008: Nil, new hire purchase and finance lease liabilities of 108.9m 2008: 63.4m were recognised.

ii The Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have, in the normal course of business, entered into a number of long-term supply contracts.
The most significant of these relate to track, station and depot access facilities, together with new train lease and maintenance arrangements.
iii Under UK Rail franchise agreements, the Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have agreed with the DfT annual amounts receivable or payable in respect of the operation of rail franchises for future periods.
Under these agreements, there is a requirement to comply with a number of obligations.
Failure to comply with these obligations would be a breach of the relevant franchise.
The Group assessed whether a provision for onerous contracts is required in respect of its rail franchises.
The Group has discounted the expected future cash flows related to its rail franchises to determine whether it is probable that the benefits to be derived by the Group from the franchises will be lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the franchises.
The Group has determined that no provision is necessary.
Estimates of cash flows are consistent with managements plans and forecasts, including an assumption supported by legal advice that the contractual disputes in respect of South Western Trains see section 3.7.
3.1 of the Operating and Financial Review on page 10 will be resolved in the Groups favour.
The estimation of future cash flows and the discount rate involves a significant degree of judgment.
Actual results can differ from those assumed and there can be no absolute assurance that the assumptions used will hold true.
Under certain circumstances following a breach by the Group of one or more of its rail franchise agreements, the DfT has the right to terminate all of the franchises operated by the Group.
Where the Group has defaulted on one franchise, the DfT has cross-default rights that might enable it but not require it to terminate all of the franchises.
The financial effect on the Group of a termination of one or more franchises would depend on which, if any, of the Groups contingent liabilities that the DfT sought to call.
As at 30 April 2009, the capital at risk of the Group in this respect was: South Western East Midlands Trains Trains Total m m m Actual liabilities Net intra-group amounts payable to train operators 39.4 2.7 42.1 Contingent liabilities Season ticket bonds 43.0 4.6 47.6 Performance bonds 55.7 20.2 75.9 Parent company guarantees to suppliers Nil 10.5 10.5 Undrawn committed loan facilities 25.0 35.0 60.0 Capital at risk as at 30 April 2009 163.1 73.0 236.1 Cash Cash in train operating companies 108.4 33.9 142.3 Pro forma impact on net debt 271.5 106.9 378.4 We consider the likelihood of the contingent liabilities crystallising as being low.
However, if all of the contingent liabilities had crystallised at 30 April 2009, the Group would have needed to have financed 236.1m and its gross debt would have increased by this amount.
In addition, the cash in the train operating companies would be transferred with the franchises and therefore the net debt of the Group would have increased by 378.4m.
There is no recourse to the Group in respect of any liabilities or contingent liabilities of Virgin Rail Group.
iv The Group and the Company are from time to time party to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
Liabilities have been recognised in the financial statements for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle obligations arising under such legal actions.
As at 30 April 2009, the accruals in the consolidated financial statements for such claims total 10.1m 2008: 9.8m.
