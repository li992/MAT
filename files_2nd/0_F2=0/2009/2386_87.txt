Finance debt continued Fair values The estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.
Long-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the year from 31 December 2009, whereas in the balance sheet the amount would be reported within current liabilities.
The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, comprising mainly commercial paper, bank loans, overdrafts and US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.

Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The group defines capital as the total equity of the group.
The groups objective for managing capital is to deliver competitive, secure and sustainable returns to maximize long-term shareholder value.
BP is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
The groups approach to managing capital is set out in its financial framework.
The group aims to strike the right balance for shareholders, between current returns via the dividend, sustained investment for long-term growth and maintaining a prudent gearing level.
At the beginning of 2008, the group rebalanced distributions away from share buybacks in favour of dividends.
During 2009, the company did not repurchase any of its own shares.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is claimed, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are non-GAAP measures.
BP uses these measures to provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
We believe that a net debt ratio in the range 20-30% provides an efficient capital structure and an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
