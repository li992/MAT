Service charge income was presented within gross rental income in prior years, however at 31 December 2009 it is presented net against property operating expenses.
Prior period comparables also have been adjusted.
Further information is included in note 1.
Property losses includes valuation deficits on investment and development properties.
Previously, development properties were accounted for under IAS 16, but are now accounted for under IAS 40.
This change has meant that with effect from 1 January 2009, revaluation surpluses and deficits on development properties are now recognised in the income statement rather than equity.
There is no impact on previously reported figures in respect of this change, as prior year comparatives are not required to be restated.
Comparative earnings per share have been restated following the rights issue on 7 April 2009 and share consolidation effective from 31 July 2009.
Further information on this is included in note 14.
