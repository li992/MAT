c Presentation currency The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling.
These accounts have been presented in US Dollars $, the functional currency of most companies within the Group.
It is deemed to be more appropriate to present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group.
The Groups policy on foreign currencies is detailed in Note 1 p. d Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the value of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income Statement of the parent company.
The loss attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009 was $57.0m 2008: loss of $19.4m.
e Joint Ventures Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and producing activities.
Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings.
Cairns principal licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairns interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on pages 78 and 79.
88 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued f Revenue and other income Revenue from operating activities Revenue represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis, and tariff income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements and is included within Other operating income in the Income Statement.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method on an accruals basis and is recognised within Finance income in the Income Statement.
g Intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant and equipment development producing assets after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within property, plant and equipment development producing assets on a field-by-field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an intangible exploration appraisal asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs.
Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement.
Net proceeds from any disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Depletion Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within property, plant and equipment development producing assets, such as fields, processing facilities and pipelines, which are significant in relation to the total cost of a development producing asset.
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment development producing assets on a unit-of-production basis, based on proved and probable reserves on a field-by-field basis.
In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
In such circumstances the exploration appraisal asset is allocated to property, plant and equipment development producing assets within the same operating segment and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within an operating segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
Impairment reviews on property, plant and equipment development producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identified in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Cairns cash-generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 89 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued g Intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets continued Impairment continued At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash generating unit is compared with the associated expected discounted future net cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the Income Statement as impairment.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of $65 bbl 2008: short-term of $50 bbl and long-term of $65 bbl, or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% 2008: 3% and 10% respectively.
Forecast production profiles are determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
h Property, plant and equipment other Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Depreciation method Tenants improvements 10 33 straight line Vehicles and equipment 25 50 straight line Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the economic life or the remaining term of the lease.
i Intangible assets other Intangible assets have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and amortised over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Depreciation method Software costs 25 50 straight line Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
See Note 1 d. j Investments The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
The recoverable value of investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of $65 bbl 2008: short-term of $50 bbl and long-term of $65 bbl or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% 2008: 3% and 10% respectively.
k Inventory Inventories of oil and condensate held at the balance sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling price in accordance with established industry practice.
l Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group holds financial assets which are classified as either available-for-sale financial assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset.
Financial liabilities are categorised as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost.
All of the Groups financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the financial instrument.
90 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued l Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
The derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the Income Statement.
The Group did not apply hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments held during the current and prior year.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables.
The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expense.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale financial assets will be recycled through the Income Statement.
Loans and other receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment.
Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of loans and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective material evidence of impairment, for example overdue trade debt.
Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.
Bank deposits Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other non-derivative financial liabilities Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings All interest bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Groups revolving credit facilities, classified according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility.
Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects which are capitalised within the property, plant and equipment development producing asset.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 91 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued m Equity Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital and share premium.
n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
o Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant and equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit-ofproduction basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the Depletion and decommissioning charge in the Income Statement, and the unwinding of the discount on the provision is included within Finance costs.
p Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentation currency, US Dollars, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated into US Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non US Dollars directly to reserves.

The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
Cairn also operates insured benefit schemes for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under local legislation.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits these are treated as defined contribution schemes.
The pension cost charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over the three year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using either the Black Scholes or binomial model, further details of which are given in Note 7.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Shares acquired to meet awards under these share schemes are held by the ESOP Trust.
The accounts of the ESOP Trust are aggregated into these financial statements.
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance phantom options are recognised over the period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
Termination benefits Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return for employee redundancy.
r Operating lease commitments Cairn charges rentals payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessor and has therefore accounted for the contracts as operating leases.
s Exceptional items Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business.
Such items are identified as exceptional and a full explanation is given in the Notes to the Accounts.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 93 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued t Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions Judgements In the process of applying Cairns accounting policies, the Group has made the following judgements, which have the most significant accounting impact in the consolidated financial results: Ravva arbitration provision Cairn has fully provided for revenues withheld by buyers in relation to the disputed share of Ravva profit petroleum due to GoI.
Cairn is taking all legal routes open to defend the Groups position and to recover the revenues which Cairn believes have been wrongfully withheld.
Success through any of these routes should result in a return of cash to the Group and the release of the provision.
Further details are given in Note 6.
Key estimations and assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results, which will only be known in time.
Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation are noted below, with further details of the assumptions contained in the relevant note.
Oil and gas reserves Cairn estimates oil and gas reserves on a proved and probable entitlement interest basis.
Gross reserve estimates are based on forecast production profiles over the remaining life of the field, determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Net entitlement reserves estimates are subsequently calculated using the Groups current oil price and cost recovery assumptions.
Estimated reserve quantities are given in the Reserves table on page 141.
Impairment testing Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using commodity price, cost and discount rate assumptions on forecast production profiles.
See Notes 1 d, 1 g, 1 j and 1 l for further details.
Depletion Depletion charges are calculated on a field-by-field basis using oil and gas reserve estimates and future capital cost assumptions.
See Note 1 g. Decommissioning estimates The Groups provision for decommissioning oil and gas assets is based on current estimates of the costs for removing and decommissioning producing facilities, the forecast timing of settlement of decommissioning liabilities and the appropriate discount rate.
Share-based payments Charges for share-based payments are based on the fair value at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using appropriate modelling techniques and inputs to the models include assumptions on leaver rates, trigger points, discount rates and volatility.
Deferred tax For certain of the Groups Indian assets, the measurement of deferred tax liabilities requires the estimation of an effective rate of tax to apply over a tax holiday period.
This effective rate is determined by the extent to which temporary differences are forecast to unwind during the tax holiday period and requires an estimation of future depletion charges expected to apply to the relevant assets based on current oil and gas reserve estimates.
Details on further estimates and assumptions used in calculating deferred tax liabilities are given in Note 1 n. 2.

Acquisitions and Disposals Disposal of Plectrum Petroleum Limited On 9 October 2008, the entire issued share capital of Plectrum Petroleum Limited whose principal asset was a 50% interest in Block Z-34, offshore Peru was transferred to Gold Oil Caribbean Limited a subsidiary of Gold Oil PLC Gold.
The Group made a payment of $1.5m to Gold in connection with the transfer.
However, no gain or loss was recognised, as Plectrum was sold at book value.
Capricorn Oil and Gas Tunisia Gmbh formerly REAP Gmbh, a subsidiary of Plectrum Petroleum Limited, which holds a 50% equity interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia, was transferred to Capricorn Petroleum Limited, a member of the Group, prior to the sale of Plectrum Petroleum Limited.
Segmental Analysis Operating segments For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business units: the Capricorn Group, being Capricorn Oil Limited and its subsidiary undertakings, and the Cairn India Group, each reporting internally to its own chief executive.
There are three reportable operating segments as follows: Cairn India Limited Groups operations are primarily within India.
Capricorn Groups operations focus on new exploration activities in Greenland and the Mediterranean.
The Capricorn Group also includes the Groups interests in Bangladesh and Nepal and a share in certain North Indian assets operated by Cairn India Limited.
Cairn Energy PLC exists to accumulate the activities and results of Cairn UK Holdings Limited, an intermediate holding company and direct parent of Cairn India Limited, and Cairn Energy PLC company results.
Unallocated expenditure and net assets liabilities, including amounts of a corporate nature not specifically attributable to one of the sub-groups, are also included within this segment.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.

This review determined that certain units were impaired and consequently $1.3m has been charged to the Income Statement.
In 2008, this review determined that the value of certain units previously impaired within the Capricorn Group was in excess of the carrying value.
As a result a reversal of the prior year impairment charge of $2.7m was recognised through the Income Statement in that year.
Refer to Note 13 and Note 14 for the reason for impairment and impairment reversals and Note 1 g for details of the assumptions used in the impairment calculation.
At the year end the Group also reviews intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment defined under IFRS 6.
Where such indicators are identified the Group tests those assets for impairment.
In the current year the write-down of intangible exploration appraisal assets followed an impairment test of the Capricorn Group cash generating unit.
The producing asset in this cash generating unit is currently carried at net present value and no additional headroom exists to support the carrying value of exploration assets where indicators of impairment are identified.
As a result a write-down of $137.5m 2008: $21.0m in relation to intangible exploration appraisal assets has been charged to the Income Statement.
$135.6m of the current year impairment has been classified as an exceptional charge against profit as it results from the assets transferred in the buy-back of minority interest in the year.
See Note 6 for further details.
In the prior year, the Group relinquished Block 5 in Bangladesh.
As a result costs of $6.5m were charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs in that year.
As these costs were previously fully impaired, the impairments were released on relinquishment of the block in 2008. c Continuing operations All profits and losses in the current and preceding year were derived from continuing operations.

The biggest single issue, the treatment of an item known as the ONGC carry, was found in Cairns favour by the arbitration panel in 2004.
This was subsequently appealed by the GoI, following which it had been disclosed as a contingent liability in the notes to the financial statements.
Cairn Indias share of this liability was $64.0m principal, plus interest of $31.6m.
98 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 6.
Exceptional items continued Ravva arbitration continued Following the procedure laid out in the Ravva Production Sharing Contract PSC, the GoIs appeal was made to the Malaysian courts and in January 2009 they decided to set aside the arbitration award made in favour of Cairn India.
Although not the final step in the legal process, the GoI then instructed the buyers of the Ravva crude not to pass over the revenues to Cairn until such time as they believed that the liability had been settled in full.
A further judgement was delivered by the Malaysian Court of Appeal in September 2009 which reversed the Malaysian Courts January 2009 ruling and had the effect of re-instating the original award in favour of Cairn India.
The GoI have applied for leave to appeal this judgement to the Federal Court of Malaysia and an admission hearing is scheduled in April 2010.
Despite the September judgement re-instating the original arbitration award, the GoI continued to prevent the buyers passing revenues to Cairn throughout the remainder of the year.
Consequently, on a conservative basis, Cairn has provided for the full $95.6m liability as an exceptional item.
The disputed share of profit petroleum of $64.0m has been charged against revenue and the potential interest charge of $31.6m has been recognised as a finance cost.
An associated deferred tax credit of $40.4m has also been recognised, making a net impact on profit after tax of $55.2m.
During the year, the cash due on $150.0m of Ravva revenues have been withheld from Cairn.
Cairn has offset $85.0m of current profit petroleum payments due to GoI against the $150.0m withheld.
The remaining $65.0m has been set off against the provision, see Note 27.
Cairns view of the merits of the underlying case remains unchanged and Cairn are taking all legal routes open to defend the Groups position and to recover the revenues which Cairn believes have been wrongfully withheld.
Success through any of these routes should result in a return of this cash to the Group.
Deemed disposal of Cairn India Limited and Farm-out of exploration appraisal assets On 14 October 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with PETRONAS to dispose of a further 2.29% of the Groups holding in Cairn India Limited and farm-out a 10% interest in each of the six Cairn operated Greenland exploration licences.
Total consideration receivable from PETRONAS is $310.0m of which $241.4m relates to the Cairn India Limited shares with the remaining $68.6m allocated across the Greenland assets.
At the year end a balance of $63.5m was due to Cairn.
The disposal of the Cairn India Limited shares results in a gain of $199.5m and reduces the Companys indirect percentage shareholding in Cairn India Limited to 62.39% at 31 December 2009.
Capital gains tax on the sale of $17.5m is charged to the Income Statement.
Under the Groups accounting policy proceeds on the disposal of intangible exploration appraisal assets are initially credited against previously capitalised costs in the Balance Sheet.
Surplus proceeds remaining are credited to the Income Statement recognising a gain of $15.0m.
PETRONAS has an option to increase its interest to 20% in any development in these blocks, in return for payment of further consideration to reflect a market valuation of the additional 10% interest at that time.
In addition, PETRONAS may also farm-in to Cairns interests in non-operated Greenland exploration licences, subject to approval, within a year of the transaction.
Proceeds will reflect the market value at that time.
In 2008 the Group made an exceptional gain of $355.8m on the deemed disposal of 4.23% of Cairn India Limited during the period.
4.12% of this disposal was through the private placement on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India, which completed on 16 April 2008.
Cairn India Limited entered an agreement with PETRONAS and Orient Global Tamarind Fund Pte Limited, further to which the investors agreed to purchase a total of 113 million shares of Cairn India Limited at Rs.
The share options exercised under the Cairn India Senior Management Plan account for the additional reduction of the Companys indirect percentage holding in Cairn India Limited.
At 31 December 2008, the Company retained an indirect holding of 64.68% in Cairn India Limited.
Impairment of intangible exploration appraisal assets On 30 November, Cairn announced the acquisition of the 9.99% minority interest held by Dyas in Capricorn Oil Limited.
Total consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares was $102.5m payable in $91.3m PLC shares, $3.7m cash and the transfer of 15% of Capricorns working interests in the Tunisian and Albanian licences.
Prior to the transfer, an impairment test was performed based on fair value less cost to sell resulting in an impairment charge of $135.6m with an associated tax credit of $33.6m.
Share-based payments At an EGM held on 21 December 2009, Cairns shareholders approved the conversion of phantom options awarded in 2007 and 2008 based on notional units in the Capricorn Group into Cairn Energy PLC Share options and LTIPs.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the incremental fair value of the modified awards, calculated at the date of modification, is charged over the remaining vesting period.
A net charge of $29.9m is therefore recognised in the Income Statement as a result of this modification.
A similar charge is expected in 2010.

The weighted average share price during the year was 2.418 2008: 2.533.
The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model.
The main inputs to the model include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
t Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
t Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options.
t The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero-coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
t Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 77, over a 10-year period to the date of award.

On the exercise of an option, participants would generally become entitled to such number of Cairn shares as have a market value equal to the notional gain that they realise, being the difference between the notional exercise price attributable to their option and the price of the units in respect of which their option has been exercised.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 December 2009 resolutions were approved to convert these phantom options into Replacement Options over ordinary shares in the Company the Replacement Share Option Plan.
The conversion was intended to put the director or employee in the same position as if, on the date the phantom option was granted, they had instead been granted an option on equivalent terms over shares in the Company.
The conversion took place on 22 December 2009.

Only 50% of these shares will be transferred to the participant immediately.
The remaining 50% will be held for a further year.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 December 2009 resolutions were approved to convert the Capricorn phantom awards into Replacement LTIP awards over ordinary shares in the Company the Replacement LTIP Plan.
The conversion did not affect the Cairn India units awarded.
The number of ordinary shares subject to each Replacement LTIP award was calculated by reference to an implied valuation of the Capricorn Group derived from the farm-in to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS.
An additional condition was made concerning the holding period: on vesting the holder is able to sell sufficient shares to fund the tax liabilities which have arisen, and the remaining shares will be held by the Companys employment benefit trust until 9 January 2013.

Taxation on Loss Profit continued a Analysis of tax credit expense in year continued There is a credit to the income statement in respect of non-exceptional Indian deferred tax of $102.9m 2008: expense of $60.3m.
In July 2009, Indian fiscal changes were enacted including an amendment to the tax holiday rules with the effect that tax relief can now be claimed for certain costs.
A tax holiday is available on a contract area basis for seven fiscal years from commencement of production and so, where tax holiday relief can be claimed, deferred tax is provided only on the timing differences which remain at the end of the tax holiday period.
Of the total credit for the year, $43.2m relates to the impact of the changes to the tax holiday rules and $59.7m is the movement in fixed assets in the year after taking account of amounts that will unwind before the end of the tax holiday period.
b Factors affecting tax credit expense for year A reconciliation of income tax expense applicable to loss profit before income tax at the applicable tax rate to income tax expense at the Groups effective income tax rate is as follows: 2009 2008 $m $m Loss profit before taxation 60.7 440.9 - - Tax at the weighted average rate of corporation tax of 61.21% 2008: 31.91% 37.2 140.7 Effects of: Minimum Alternate Tax payable 17.5 5.3 Adjustments in respect of prior years current tax 5.8 6.1 deferred tax 17.5 Temporary differences not recognised 62.3 34.7 Gain on deemed disposal of subsidiaries 55.9 101.0 Impairment of non-qualifying assets 17.0 Share-based payments 11.0 3.2 Indian tax holiday 164.0 26.5 Non-deductible expenses and non-taxable income 13.6 6.3 Indian tax on capital gain 17.5 Withholding tax 0.1 0.2 Foreign exchange movements 11.0 0.5 Other 0.6 - - Total tax credit expense 123.3 74.2 - - The applicable tax rate was the weighted average rate for the year of the UK, Netherlands, Australian, Indian, Jersey, Swiss, Bangladeshi, Tunisian, Sri Lankan, Singaporean and Mauritian tax rates.
On 1 April 2009, the Indian Minimum Alternate Tax rate increased from 10.56% to 15.84%, resulting in an average rate for the year of 14.53%.

The minority interest was created in 2007 when Dyas acquired its holding in Capricorn with the group recording a gain on deemed disposal of $40.0m in that year.
Total consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares was $102.5m.
With the minority interest at the date of the transaction being $41.0m, goodwill of $62.8m is recognised on the buy-back after deducting further costs resulting from the transaction.
The consideration payable to Dyas consisted of $91.3m PLC shares and $3.7m in cash, both settled at the time of the transaction.
The remaining $7.5m liability is to be settled by transferring 15% of the Capricorn Groups working interests in the Tunisian and Albanian assets, subject to approval.
All goodwill recognised has been allocated to the Capricorn cash-generating unit, which is also a reporting segment, and has been tested for impairment.
No impairment has been identified.
The recoverable amount of the Capricorn cash-generating unit has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets within the unit as reported to management.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are disclosed in Note 1 g. The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factors which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit are the results of the future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 7% p. a.
The change in decommissioning estimate in 2008 arose as a result of a third party review of estimated costs of decommissioning for the Ravva and Lakshmi and Gauri fields together with estimates of additional wells drilled in Rajasthan and the Rajasthan facilities in place at the year end.
Continued progress on the Rajasthan producing facilities during 2009 further increases the Groups future obligation for decommissioning.
Other provisions include $8.8m relating to phantom options awarded to certain employees in India and a $2.3m provision for onerous contracts relating to the Groups Sangu asset.
Provisions for committed spend recognised on the acquisition of Plectrum and medOil of $2.0m were utilised during 2009.
A provision of $95.6m regarding the Ravva arbitration proceedings was made during the year.
Payments withheld by the buyers of Ravva crude on the instruction of GoI have been offset against current profit petroleum payments due to GoI with the remaining excess offset against the provision.

Foreign currency translation Group Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves in accordance with IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Company Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arise on translation of the Companys functional results into $ presentation currency in accordance with IAS 21.
Capital reserves non-distributable Capital reserves non-distributable include non-distributable amounts arising on various Group acquisitions.
Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies Group and Company The main risks arising from the Companys and the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and credit risk.
The respective Boards of Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn India Limited review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below: The Groups treasury functions at Cairn Energy PLC, Cairn India Limited and local operational offices are responsible for these risks, other than credit risk relating to trade receivables for their respective businesses, in accordance with the policy set by their Board.
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques.
These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the companies and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
Trade receivable credit risk is managed by the local operational management teams.
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, short and medium-term deposits, money market liquidity and mutual funds, intra-group loans, forward contracts, foreign exchange options, and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives such as equity and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the respective Boards, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas projects.
Liquidity risk During 2008, Cairn India had an $850.0m revolving credit facility to fund Rajasthan developments from a consortium of international banks and the International Finance Corporation.
During 2009, the Cairn India Group refinanced this facility through a combination of US Dollar USD Facility and Indian Rupee loans INR Facility.
The USD Facility is provided by a consortium of 6 international banks and the International Finance Corporation.
Interest is charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the facility expires 31 December 2015.
The maximum facility amount that can be drawn at any point in time is determined by reference to the net present value of the Rajasthan developments.
The full $750.0m facility is currently available to be drawn, out of which $399.8m was drawn at 31 December 2009.
Cairn India may cancel and repay the facility at any time.
Under the terms of the facility agreement, security in terms of share pledge over the shares in Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited a 100% indirect subsidiary of Cairn India Limited which holds 50% of the Groups interest in Rajasthan has been provided.
The INR Facility is provided by a consortium of seven leading Indian banks and financial institutions.
The maximum facility amount is INR 40bn $863m, interest is charged on floating rates linked to the State Bank of Indias Prime Lending Rate and the facility expires 31 December 2015.
The full facility is currently available to be drawn, of which INR 13,450m $290m was drawn as at 31 December 2009.
Under the terms of the INR facility agreement, security in terms of a charge over the participating interest of Cairn Energy India Pty Limited a 100% indirect subsidiary of Cairn India Limited which holds 50% of the Groups interest in Rajasthan in the Rajasthan block is to be executed as condition subsequent.

Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued Liquidity risk continued On 28 March 2008, Cairn Energy PLC entered into a 30.0m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital.
The facility was jointly provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and HBOS PLC and was to expire on 31 January 2013.
Interest was charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
No sums were drawn at 31 December 2009 2008: nil.
The facility was cancelled on 20 January 2010.
In addition, as at 31 December 2009, the Group has $66.2m 2008: $80.0m of facilities in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees.
Fixed rates of interest apply to these.
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds, fixed-term deposits and mutual funds with a number of International and Indian banks and financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk.
Policies are in place to limit counterparty exposure.
The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and other measures where appropriate.
Interest rate risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium-term deposits at floating rates.
It is Cairns policy to deposit funds with banks or other financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue.
The requirement to achieve an acceptable yield is balanced against the need to minimise liquidity and counterparty risk.
Short medium-term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates.
The treasury functions may from time to time opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there are no such instruments 2008: none.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a change in interest rates through the impact on floating rate borrowings and investments.
Increase decrease Effect on profit in basis points before tax 2009 50 $6.9m 2008 50 $4.5m In addition there would be a change of $3.6m to development producing assets carrying value as a result of the capitalisation of the borrowing costs for the Rajasthan development 2008: $0.8m.
The amounts calculated are based on actual drawings and investments in the periods for a 50 basis point movement in the total rate of interest on each loan or investment.
Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts and payments have mostly been in US Dollars and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US Dollars.
As a result of the Rajasthan developments, there has been an increased exposure between the Indian Rupee and US Dollar in the current period.
This has now been significantly mitigated with the $ and INR facilities which allow matching of drawings and payments.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The Group also aims where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in functional currency, which in most cases is US Dollars, thereby matching the presentation currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group.
This minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant, the Company and Group may, from time to time, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
In 2008 Cairn India entered into forward foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development.
The fair value of the outstanding currency derivatives in Cairn India Group as at 31 December 2009 was $nil 2008: $3.7m.
Refer to Note 30 for further details.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the $:GBP and $:INR exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups monetary assets and liabilities.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva, CB-OS 2 and Rajasthan oil sales are made to approved government nominated buyers or approved third parties at floating prices.
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during either the current or the previous year.
There were no outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
The Group would not normally hedge commodity price risk but the respective Boards do monitor the position.
Credit risk Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the CB-OS 2 and Sangu GSCs.
With respect to Ravva and Rajasthan there are no payment securities: however, the buyers are either nominated by the GoI or are reputed private companies with good credit and payment record.
Credit risk from investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Treasury functions in accordance with the Board approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn India Limited respectively.
Investments of surplus funds are only made with approved counterparties who meet the appropriate rating and or other criteria, and are only made within approved limits.
The respective Boards continually re-assess the Groups policy and update as required.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty failure.
Investments by the Group in money market liquidity funds are only made with AAA rated funds and where the investment policy is limited to money market instruments.
PLC and Capricorn Group limit the placing of deposits and other investments to banks or financial institutions that have at least two AAor above ratings from Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch, unless a Sovereign Guarantee is available from an AAA rated government.
The counterparty limit is $100m and a maximum of 5% of a fund.
Cairn Indias policy is to limit the placing of deposits to banks with Moodys long-term deposit rating of A2 and above in the case of $ funds and with Board-approved domestic banks in case of INR funds at present all of them are AAA rated by CRISIL, a subsidiary of S&P.
The counterparty limit varies from $50m to $400m for various categories of banks.
Investments in $ money market liquidity funds are limited to schemes rated AAA by S&P, Moodys and Fitch and are placed with Board-approved domestic debt mutual funds in the case of INR funds.
Counterparty limits in case of money market mutual funds are $60m or 10% of the corpus, whichever is lower.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in Note 20.
Deposits are spread over more than 20 banks and institutions to ensure no concentration of risk.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

The respective Boards manage their own capital structure and make adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Groups may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.

Contingent Liabilities Ravva Joint Venture Arbitration proceedings: Base Development Cost In a dispute separate and unrelated to the profit petroleum calculations under the Ravva PSC disclosed in Note 6, the Ravva joint venture received a claim from the Director General of Hydrocarbons DGH for the period from 2000-2005 for $166.4m for an alleged underpayment of profit petroleum to the Indian Government, out of which Cairn India Groups share will be $37.4m INR 1,909m plus potential interest at applicable rate LIBOR plus 2% as per PSC.
This claim relates to the Indian Governments allegation that the Ravva JV has recovered costs in excess of the Base Development Costs BDC cap imposed in the PSC and that the Ravva JV has also allowed these excess costs in the calculation of the Post Tax Rate of Return PTRR.
Cairn believes that such a claim is unsustainable under the terms of the PSC because, amongst other reasons, the BDC cap only applies to the initial development of the Ravva field and not to subsequent development activities under the PSC.
Additionally the Ravva JV has also contested the basis of the calculation in the above claim from the DGH.
Even if upheld, Cairn believes that the DGH has miscalculated the sums that would be due to the Indian Government in such circumstances.
To resolve this dispute, arbitration proceedings have been initiated, the arbitration panel been fully constituted and pleadings exchanged.
The matter is set for hearing in April 2010.
Indian Service Tax One of the subsidiary companies of the Cairn India Group has received four show cause notices from the tax authorities in India for non-payment of service tax as a recipient of services from foreign suppliers.
These notices cover periods from 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2009.
A writ petition has been filed with Chennai High Court challenging the liability to pay service tax as recipient of services in respect of first show cause notice 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2006 and challenging the scope of some services in respect of second show cause notice 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007.
The reply for second and third show cause notice has also been filed before the authorities.

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 139 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 34.
Contingent Liabilities continued Indian Tax Holiday on Gas Production Section 80-IB 9 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 allows the deduction of 100% of profits from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil.
The term mineral oil is not defined but has always been understood to refer to both oil and gas, either separately or collectively.
The 2008 Indian Finance Bill appeared to remove this deduction by stating without amending section 80-IB 9 that for the purpose of section 80-IB 9, the term mineral oil does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of the Act.
Subsequent announcements by the Finance Minister and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas have confirmed that tax holiday relief would be available on production of crude oil but have continued to exclude gas.
Cairn India filed a writ petition to the Gujarat High Court in December 2008 challenging the restriction of section 80-IB to the production of oil.
Gujarat High Court did not admit the writ petition on the grounds that the matter needs to be first decided by lower tax authorities.
An SLP has been filed before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Gujarat High Court.
In the event this challenge is unsuccessful, the potential liability for tax and related interest on tax holiday claimed on gas production for all periods to 31 March 2010 is approximately $49.6m.
