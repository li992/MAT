Following evaluation of the market risk, the Company selectively enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure.
The following table analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, net-settled derivative financial instruments and gross-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows.

Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the Companys financial instruments to uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates is as follows: Foreign exchange risk The following analysis details the Companys sensitivity to movements in pounds sterling against all currencies in which it has significant transactions.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 25% change in foreign currency rates.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have an adverse impact on profit of 33 million 2008: adverse impact of 2 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 13 million 2008: adverse impact of 15 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have a beneficial impact on profit of 54 million 2008: beneficial impact of 4 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 21 million 2008: beneficial impact of 25 million.

qxp:BSKYB 7 8 09 22:18 Page 117 Bleed: 2.647 mm Scale: 100% Interest rate risk The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
For each one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates at 30 June 2009, and if all other variables were held constant, the Companys profit for the year ended 30 June 2009 would decrease or increase by 5 million 2008: increase or decrease by 4 million and other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 4 million 2008: decrease or increase by 4 million.
The sensitivity analyses provided are hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Companys actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Companys portfolio of debt, foreign currency and equity contracts changes.
In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash ows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Company.
The changes in valuations are estimates of the impact of changes in market variables and are not a prediction of future events or anticipated gains or losses.

In addition, deferred taxation relating to these derivatives is also initially recognised in the hedging reserve prior to transfer to the income statement.
