Share-based payments Share options Share options are granted to Executive Directors and Senior Management based on performance criteria.
The scheme rules are described in the Directors Remuneration Report and repeated below.
All share-based payments are equity settled.
At 31st December 2009, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the years 2010 to 2019, to acquire 2,099,551 2008: 2,022,251 shares of the Company at prices ranging from 0.68 to 4.54 per share 2008: 0.1675 to 4.54.
The vesting period of the options is 3 years, with an exercise period of 7 years, making a 10 year maximum term.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
For the share options outstanding as at 31st December 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.75 years 2008: 1.242 years.
During the year share options were granted in accordance with The New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved Share Option Scheme collectively the New Share Option Schemes that were introduced in 2001.
They reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 the ABI Guidelines.
For the options to vest there has to be an increase in Share Price combined with a comparison to an external benchmark the Financial Times Stock Exchange Oil & Gas Producers Index FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index.
As a result of an increase in share price in the first quarter of 2006 the Company moved up into the FTSE 250 Index FTSE 250 and the benchmark was therefore reviewed and the Remuneration Committee decided that the higher of the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index was the most appropriate.
The Rules of the New Share Option Schemes address eligibility, timing of grants and exercise of options etc, and require that the shareholders are to be consulted if any substantive amendments to the Rules are required.
The Remuneration Committee Committee has discretion as to the application of the Rules of the New Share Option Schemes, particularly in the level of awards and the setting of the level of Performance Conditions.
96 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 The Committee has prepared internal guidelines to enable it to administer the New Share Option Schemes.
In awarding share options the Committee take into account the ABI Guidelines in terms of individual and collective limits, the need for demanding Performance Conditions etc, and other factors such as the performance of the Company and the individual in the previous 12 months, the effect of the vesting of grants awarded in previous years e. g. dilution, cost to the Company and the overall remuneration level annual salary, bonus award and benefits of the individual relative to the market.
Grants are made by reference to the market value mid Market price of the Companys shares under option at the time of grant.
Executive Directors and employees are not required to pay for the grant of share options.
After three years the number of options that can be exercised is determined by two factors: 1 the actual increase in the Companys Share Price: and 2 a comparison of the actual increase in the Share Price to the change in the FTSE FI until the end of June 2004, FTSE SI until the end of February 2006 and the higher of the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index after that date.
The Share Price and FTSE Factors will be multiplied together and the resultant figure will be applied to the number of options granted to an individual to determine the number of options to be vested.
The structure has been designed to introduce a sliding scale as distinct from a specific individual benchmark.
It will require the Share Price to double and this increase to be in the top quartile of the growth in the FTSE FI SI Oil & Gas Producers Index for all of the awards granted to an individual to determine the number of options that vest.
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee has determined that an option holder will only be able to exercise up to 50% of vested options at any one time and up to 50% after a period of 12 months, unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 56.90p 2008: 72.35p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the standard binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the Companys share price directly.
The performance condition based on performance relative to other companies is modelled with a Monte Carlo model.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31st December 2009 and 31st December 2008.
The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.

The full details of the bonus performance criteria are explained in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 56.
The bonus accrued for 2009 was $1.4m 2008: $0.7m and was paid in January 2010.
