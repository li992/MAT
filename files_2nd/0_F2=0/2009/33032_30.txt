Financial instruments and risk management continued The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008 was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Derivative financial assets 2,700 387 Investments 218 471 a Trade and other receivables 3,101 3,193 Cash and cash equivalents 1,300 1,435 Total 7,319 5,486 a The carrying amount excludes 1,084m 2008: 1,256m of current and 322m 2008: 854m of non current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets.
Note 17 discloses the credit concentration and credit quality of derivative financial assets.
After applying a legal right of set off under the groups International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation, the group had a net exposure to derivative counterparties of 2,282m.
Of this, 85% was with six counterparties.
The majority of these derivatives are in designated cash ow hedges.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of net derivative financial assets at 31 March 2009, a 100 basis point increase in yield curves across each of the ratings categories within which these derivative financial assets are classied would reduce their carrying values and impact equity, pre-tax, as follows: Impact of 100 basis point increase m Moody's S&P credit rating Aa2 AA 18 Aa3 AA 21 A1 A 92 A2 A 146 A3 A 277 The credit quality of other treasury related financial assets is provided in notes 9 and 13.
The groups credit policy for trading related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection when appropriate, taking into consideration the customers exposure to the group, by applying processes which include netting and off-setting, and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group has taken proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading related financial assets.
The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 15 which analyses outstanding balances by line of business and reects the nature of customers in each segment.
Liquidity risk management The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the centralised treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the Board.
The groups capital management policy is to target a solid investment grade credit rating whilst continuing to invest for the future and, with an efficient balance sheet.
The groups liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ows and considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources and back-up facilities.
The Board reviews forecasts, including cash ow forecasts, on a quarterly basis.
The centralised treasury operation reviews cash ows more frequently to assess the short and medium-term requirements.
These assessments ensure the group responds to possible future cash constraints in a timely manner.
Liquid assets surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed by the centralised treasury operation.
Requests from group companies for operating finance are met whenever possible from central resources.
2009 2008 2007 m m m Net debt note 10 10,361 9,460 7,914 During 2009, the groups net debt increased from 9.5bn to 10.4bn primarily driven by lower free cash ow being exceeded by dividend and share buy back payments.
During 2009, debt amounting to 0.9bn matured consisting of Sterling oating rate notes.
This was offset by new issuances of 1.5bn mainly consisting of a 1bn bond at 6.5% repayable in 2015, which was swapped into 0.8bn at an average annualised Sterling interest rate of 7.7%, and commercial paper.
In addition, investments of 0.3bn matured.
During 2008, the groups net debt increased from 7.9bn to 9.5bn primarily driven by the groups share buy back programme.
During 2008, debt amounting to 1.9bn matured consisting of 2007 US dollar 7% notes, finance leases and commercial paper.
This was more than offset by new issuances of 3.9bn mainly consisting of issuances through the groups European Medium Term Note and US Shelf programmes with maturities ranging between 2013 and 2037 and bank loans see note 16.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair value of financial instruments The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to their fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2009 and 2008.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair value of the financial instruments is the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts were the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
