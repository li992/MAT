Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis based on the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
The fair value of each category of financial asset and liability is not materially different from the carrying values presented for either 2009 or 2008.
The following table provides an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Operating costs are influenced by production and sales levels, operating costs, capital expenditure levels and financial income the countries in which the Groups operations are based principally in Chile as well as those and costs.

The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for any doubtful receivables.
vii Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and financing facilities, through the review of forecast and actual cash flows.
The Group typically holds surplus cash balances in either demand deposits or short-term deposits, while the majority of borrowings comprise corporate loans at Los Pelambres, repayable over periods of up to five years, and corporate loans at Esperanza, repayable over approximately 12 years.
At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the Group was in a net cash position, as disclosed in Note 33.
Details of cash and cash equivalents are given in Note 22, while details of borrowings including the maturity profile are given in Note 23.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are also given in Note 23 e. The following table analyses the maturity of the Groups contractual commitments in respect of its financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

viii Capital risk management The Groups objective when managing its capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimal capital structure.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 23, cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in Note 22 and equity attributable to minority interest and equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 29.
The Group reviews its capital structure on a regular basis.
Based on this, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of ordinary and special dividends, the issue of new shares or repurchase of existing shares, the raising of additional debt or the redemption of existing debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from the prior year.
Overview Business Review Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 93 d Embedded derivatives provisionally priced sales Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly average molybdenum price for specified future periods.
This normally ranges from 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer.
Under IFRS, both gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open sales are recognised through adjustments to turnover in the income statement and to trade debtors in the balance sheet.
The Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market for that commodity.

e Derivative financial instruments The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows have been recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement have been recorded within turnover.
The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income statement within other finance items.
Realised gains and losses and changes in the fair value of exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other finance items.
