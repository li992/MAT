Share based payments The group operates share option and share purchase schemes for employees, the majority of which are on an equity settled basis.
The purpose of the staff share schemes is to promote an esprit fide corps within the organisation, create an awareness of Investecs performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group.
Further information on the group share options and long-term incentive plans are provided on pages 194 to 197 of the Remuneration Report.

Reclassifi cations of fi financial instruments 2009 During the year the group reclassi ed certain financial instruments out of fair value through pro t and loss.
These assets were originally classi ed as held for trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group now intends to hold these assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity rather than to trade in the short-term.
On 30 January 2009 a portfolio of asset backed securities was reclassi ed to loans and receivables.
On 31 March 2009 a portfolio of asset backed securities was reclassi ed to loans and receivables and a residual position was reclassi ed to available for sale.
At the time of the transfers, the group identi ed rare circumstances permitting such reclassi cation, being severe liquidity in the relevant markets.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassi ed: 000 Carrying Carrying Fair value value as value as at as at at date of 31 March 31 March transfer 2009 2009 Trading assets reclassi ed to loans and receivables 112 250 112 402 106 189 Trading assets reclassi ed to available for sale 7 797 7 797 7 797 Total fi financial assets reclassifi ed 120 047 120 199 113 986 The reclassi ed financial instruments have expected recoverable cash ows of 134.2 million.
After reclassi cation, the assets contributed a loss of 262 000 to the 2009 income before taxation.
Prior to reclassi cation 656 000 of net interest expense and 17 275 000 of unrealised fair value losses on the reclassi ed trading assets was recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year.
As at the date of reclassi cation, the effective interest rates on reclassi ed trading assets ranged from 4.61% to 18.29%.
Fair value hierarchy For financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value, the table that follows provides details of the bases used for determining the fair value according to the following hierarchy: Level 1 - The use of quoted market prices for identical instruments in an active market: Level 2 - The use of a valuation technique using observable inputs.
This may include: - using quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments: - using quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar instruments: or - using models where all signi cant inputs are observable.
Level 3 - Using models where one or more signi cant inputs are not observable.
The table includes investment properties in the analysis as this is an asset carried at fair value with fair value adjustments recognised through pro t and loss.
Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.

Analysis of assets and liabilities by fi financial instrument classifi cation Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair values of the groups financial instruments that are recognised on balance sheet.
The table does not include the fair values of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity less than three months, it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
This assumption also applies to demand deposits, and savings accounts without a speci c maturity.
Fixed rate fi financial instruments The fair value of xed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments.
The estimated fair value of xed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash ows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash ow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.

Derivative fi financial instruments Derivatives The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
All interest rate contracts are transacted with other financial institutions.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables that follow, notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash ows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash ows within the cash generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure.
Discount rates are arrived at based on pre-taxation rates that re ect current market conditions, adjusted for the speci c risks associated with the cash generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.

Goodwill continued UK, Europe and Australia The two most signi cant cash generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management and Kensington.
For Investec Asset Management, the recoverability of goodwill of 88.0 million has been tested with reference to both the underlying pro tability taking account 2009 pro ts before taxation of 17.1 million and budgets and plans for the next three years and the value of the business as represented by funds under management of 13.1 billion 2008: 13.8 billion.
Although both pro tability and total funds under management declined during the year re ecting the tougher environment and weak equity markets, the value of goodwill is comfortably supported.
Goodwill of 121.1 million arising on the acquisition of Kensington on 7 August 2008 was written down by 60.0 million at 31 March 2008 to 61.2 million following the managed reduction in business volumes and limited activity in securitisation markets.
At 31 March 2009, the remaining goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of the existing book, assuming no new mortgage origination and no recovery in securitisation markets.
Cash ows have been projected for a 5 year period using the latest available information on debts and expected repayments discounted at 11%.
On this basis the value of goodwill is 145% above book value.
Future impairment of this goodwill will largely be dependent on the timing of future repayments.
South Africa The majority of goodwill attributed to the South African operations relate to Investec Asset Management, particulary to the businesses from the Fedsure acquisition, which have been identi ed as a separate cash generating unit.
The goodwill relating to Fedsure has been tested for impairment, taking into account pro tability, being the current year pro ts and the budgeted pro ts and funds under management.
The discount rates applied of between 10.7% and 13.2% are determined by using the South African risk free rate adjusted for the risk related to the cash generating unit.
An impairment of 1.5 million was recognised in the current year on this goodwill.
Movement in goodwill 2009 There were no movements in goodwill arising from acquisitions or disposals of group operations.
2008 Goodwill arising on acquisition includes 121.1 million on the acquisition of Kensington Group plc on 8 August 2007 and 17.5 million in respect of the acquisition of Experien Pty Limited on 1 October 2007 see note 31.
Kensington Group plc forms part of the Capital Markets segment in the United Kingdom and Experien Pty Limited forms part of the Private Banking segment in Australia.
Income statement movement 2009 Following adverse movements in commodity prices which have squeezed margins, Global Ethanol Holdings Limited, in which the group has a 68.3% interest, impaired all of the 26.5 million of goodwill mainly relating to its 60% owned subsidiary Global Ethanol LLC.
Other goodwill impairments of 4.6 million.
2008 2.9 million in respect of the portfolio of businesses acquired from the Fedsure Group.
The impairment calculation was based on a discounted cash ow valuation, utilising a discount rate of 14.5%.
The impairment was in the Asset Management segment in South Africa.
59.9 million in respect of the acquisition of Kensington Group plc.
The goodwill impairment takes into account the managed reduction in business volumes and the limited activity in securitisation markets.
A discount rate of 11% was utilised in the cash ow valuation.
The impairment was in the Capital Markets segment in the United Kingdom.

Staff share scheme The group operates a share option and a share purchase scheme for employees.
The number of ordinary shares conditionally allocated to employees are disclosed in note 7.
Movements in the number of share options issued to each option is in respect of one share employees are as follows: For the year to 31 March Number Number 2009 2008 Outstanding at 1 April 57 222 077 59 572 252 Issued during the year 11 745 481 14 891 449 Exercised 4 283 218 13 223 813 Lapsed 2 395 147 4 017 811 Outstanding at 31 March 62 289 193 57 222 077 The purpose of the staff share scheme is to promote an esprit fide corps within the organisation, create an awareness of Investecs performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group.
The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation based on their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, these share awards vest over periods varying from five to eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance, and contribution made by, the respective staff members.
The extent of the directors and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 201.

The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
During the 2008 09 financial year, a number of institutions, including Bradford & Bingley plc, Heritable Bank plc, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander Limited, Landsbanki Islands hf Icesave and London Scottish Bank plc, were declared in default or were deemed in default by virtue of a statutory instrument.
In order to meet its obligations to the depositors of these institutions, the FSCS has as of 4 February 2009 borrowed 19.7 billion from HM Treasury, on an interest only basis for the first three years of the loan.
Furthermore, HM Treasury intends to require the FSCS to make a contribution to the transfer costs of certain assets of Dunfermline Building Society to Nationwide Building Society in accordance with Section 214B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
The extent of such contribution, its timing and any possible impact on Investec are, at this stage, impossible to estimate.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members to meet its management expenses and compensation costs.
Individual participating members make payments based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent of total protected deposits at 31 December each year.
If an institution is a participating member on this date it is obligated to pay a levy imposed in the immediately following levy period.
Investec Bank plc was a participating member of the FSCS at 31 December 2007 and 2008.
Investec Bank plc has accrued 2 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS including the interest on the loan from HM Treasury in respect of the two levy years to 31 March 2010.
The accrual includes estimates for the interest FSCS will pay on the loan and estimates of Investecs market participation in the relevant periods.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
If the remaining available assets of the defaulting institutions are insuf cient to allow the FSCS to repay the HM Treasury loan when due, the FSCS will agree a schedule of repayments of any remaining principal outstanding with HM Treasury, which will be recouped from the industry in the form of additional levies.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amounts or timing of amounts that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Legal proceedings Investec is party to various legal proceedings, the ultimate resolution of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.

Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with non-trading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the central Treasury in the Capital Markets business.
Once aggregated and netted, Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, central Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within fide ned parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependant on the classi cation between fair value hedges, cash ow hedges and in particular, accounting hedges which require the identi cation of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of xed rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.
Hedges continued Cash fl ow hedges The group is exposed to variability in cash ows on future liabilities arising from changes in base interest rates.
The aggregate expected cash ows are hedged based on cash ow forecasts with reference to terms and conditions present in the affected contractual arrangements.
Changes in fair value are initially recognised in equity and transferred to the income statement when the cash ow occurs.
