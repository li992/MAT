The pension cost relating to the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected credit unit method.
Actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period in which they arise.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that benefits have already vested and otherwise, is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost.
If necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the amount that can be recovered through reduced Company contributions in the future plus any refunds that have been agreed at the balance sheet date.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 32 of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements.
In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc market conditions.
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
ESOP trusts Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity.
Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.

The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2010 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is 933.0 million 31 December 2008: 943.1 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 517.2 million 31 December 2008: 528.5 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 415.8 million 31 December 2008: 414.6 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2009 is 407.7 million 31 December 2008: 430.1 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 201.0 million 31 December 2008: 219.1 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 206.7 million 31 December 2008: 211.0 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of the credit profile of the counterparty, HHC, to assess the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2009 the Company has recognised a financial liability of 9.3 million 31 December 2008: 9.0 million in respect of these guarantees.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.7 million.

The sources used to determine the expected rates of return include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
The contributions made by the employers in 2009, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were 7.0 million 2008: 6.0 million.
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 20.5% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional 133,333 per month to remove the shortfall in funding identified at 30 September 2007 and 62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan.
These lead to an expected contribution of 7.1 million in 2010.
As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age of the membership increases.
