Contingent liabilities arising from litigation against the Group are disclosed in Note 42.
Nominal principal amounts represent the amounts at risk should contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default.
The amount of the loan commitments shown above reflects, where relevant, the expected level of take-up of pre-approved loan offers made by mailshots to personal customers.
As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.
Guarantees HSBC provides guarantees and similar undertakings on behalf of both third-party customers and other entities within the HSBC Group.
These guarantees are generally provided in the normal course of HSBCs banking business.
The principal types of guarantees provided, and the maximum potential amount of future payments which HSBC could be required to make at 31 December 2009, were as follows: At 31 December 2009 At 31 December 2008 Guarantees Guarantees by HSBC by HSBC Holdings Holdings Guarantees in in favour of Guarantees in favour of favour of other HSBC in favour of other HSBC third parties Group entities third parties Group entities US$m US$m US$m US$m Guarantee type 1 Financial guarantees and similar contracts............................. 23,558 35,073 20,879 47,341 2 Standby letters of credit that are financial guarantee contracts 10,712 11,171 3 Other direct credit substitutes.................................................. 4,676 4,613 4 Performance bonds.................................................................. 14,468 15,304 4 Bid bonds................................................................................. 728 627 4 Standby letters of credit related to particular transactions...... 4,944 4,791 4 Other transaction-related guarantees....................................... 13,577 15,028 Other items................................................................................ 722 482 73,385 35,073 72,895 47,341 1 Financial guarantees are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss incurred because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
Similar contracts are contracts that provide protection against credit risk on a specified exposure but do not meet the definition of financial guarantees.
The amounts in the above table are nominal principal amounts.
2 Standby letters of credit which are financial guarantee contracts are irrevocable obligations on the part of HSBC to pay third parties when customers fail to make payments when due.
3 Other direct credit substitutes include re-insurance letters of credit and trade-related letters of credit issued without provision for the issuing entity to retain title to the underlying shipment.
4 Performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and other transaction-related guarantees are undertakings by which the obligation on HSBC to make payment depends on the outcome of a future event.
463 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Notes 39 and 40 The amounts disclosed in the above table reflect HSBCs maximum exposure under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings.
The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with HSBCs overall credit risk management policies and procedures.
Approximately half of the above guarantees have a term of less than one year.
Guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to HSBCs annual credit review process.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number of deposit takers such as Bradford & Bingley plc, Heritable Bank plc, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander Limited, Landsbanki Icesave, London Scottish Bank plc and Dunfermline Building Society.
The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from the Bank of England and HM Treasury.
HSBC Bank plc the bank could be liable to pay a proportion of the outstanding borrowings that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury which at 30 September 2009 stood at US$32 billion.
The bank is also obligated to pay its share of forecast management expenses based on the banks market share of deposits protected under the FSCS.
The bank expensed US$212 million at 31 December 2009 in respect of the share of forecast management expense, including interest costs, for the 2008 9, 2009 10 and 2010 11 levy years.
The fee in respect of the 2008 9 levy year was paid during the second half of 2009.
At 31 December 2009, the bank accrued US$182 million in respect of the 2009 10 and 2010 11 levy years, based on the banks estimated share of total market protected deposits at 31 December 2008 and 2009, respectively.
At 31 December 2008, the bank had accrued US$125 million in respect of the 2008 9 and 2009 10 levy years, based on the banks estimated share of total market protected deposits at 31 December 2007 and 2008, respectively.
However, the ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the 2008 collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the interest rate, the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Sales of Payment Protection Insurance On 1 July 2008 the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS wrote to the FSA to draw to its attention under the Wider Implications process the issues arising from past payment protection insurance PPI sales.
The FOS considered that there was evidence of widespread and regular failure on the part of many firms to comply with the FSAs rules and insurance law in the sale of PPI and that, in the circumstances, simply allowing consumers individually to bring complaints was not the right way to tackle what it regarded as a systemic problem.
The FOS therefore called upon the FSA to frame and implement an appropriate regulatory solution which would ensure that firms took appropriate and proportionate remedial action.
On 29 September 2009, the FSA published a Consultation Paper CP 09 23 setting out proposals, and draft Rules and Guidance, on how firms should assess PPI complaints and, where they up-held such complaints, calculate redress.
At the same time, it also published an open letter to eight trade associations, including the British Bankers Association, setting out what it considered to be common failings by firms in sales of PPI.
When announcing the publication of CP 09 23, the FSA also reported that it had obtained agreement from firms representing 40 per cent of the market for face to face single premium PPI sales to review all such sales since July 2007.
No HSBC subsidiary or associate was included in that group of firms.
The Consultation Paper anticipated new FSA rules and guidance covering how firms should deal with PPI complaints with effect from the beginning of 2010.
However, the FSA subsequently announced that, owing to the large number of responses it had received to the Consultation Paper, this date would be deferred to give it sufficient opportunity to fully consider those responses.
On 2 February 2010, the FSA stated that the course of action it will take in relation to PPI remains under consideration and that no final decision on the matter has yet been taken.
The precise form and content of the FSAs final rules and guidance in relation to PPI complaint handling therefore remains unclear at this stage.
In the circumstances, it is not possible for HSBC to determine what impact, if any, the FSAs proposals will eventually have.
In December 2007, HSBC decided to cease selling PPI but not short-term income protection products under its HSBC, first direct and M&S Money brands.
A phased withdrawal was completed across these brands and channels in 464
