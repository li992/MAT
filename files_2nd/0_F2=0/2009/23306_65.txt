vi Unlisted illiquid investments Where there is no active market, unlisted illiquid investments are valued at valuations determined by the Directors using an appropriate valuation technique, such as earnings multiples, recent transactions, cashflow and net assets.

Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.
Futures contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and any profits and losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.

Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
