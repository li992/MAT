American pp38 55 11 3 10 9:35 am Page 38 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The disclosures on going concern on page 22 of the Directors Report form part of these financial statements.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off in the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, performance fees and other capital receivables and payables, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end, unrealised gains and losses on the forward foreign currency contract and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital return.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Stock lending income is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: performance fees are allocated 100% to capital.
management fees are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of an investment are charged to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 20 on page 48.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 American pp38 55 11 3 10 9:35 am Page 39 e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debenture in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included in the income statement as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
h Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is allocated to capital.
i Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.

Taxation 2009 2008 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 a Analysis of tax charge in the year UK corporation tax at 28% 2008: 28.5% 520 520 1,035 1,035 Double taxation relief 520 520 1,035 1,035 Overseas withholding tax 1,008 1,008 1,065 1,065 Tax attributable to expenses and finance 1 costs charged to capital 52 52 870 870 Current tax charge for the year 1,060 52 1,008 1,935 870 1,065 1 With effect from 1st July 2009, overseas dividends are no longer chargeable to corporation tax.
Accordingly, tax relief on expenses and finance costs charged to capital has fallen substantially this year and will be zero in future years.
b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation 5,600 27,891 33,491 6,788 28,810 22,022 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the applicable rate of corporation tax of 28% 2008: 28.5% 1,568 7,809 9,377 1,935 8,211 6,276 Effects of: Non taxable overseas dividends 1,049 1,049 Non taxable capital returns losses 8,920 8,920 6,686 6,686 Income taxed in different periods 168 168 58 58 Tax relief on capitalised expenses 1,111 1,111 1,525 1,525 Overseas withholding tax 1,008 1,008 1,065 1,065 Unrelieved expenses and charges 944 944 683 683 Relief for overseas taxation 520 520 1,035 1,035 Tax attributable to expenses charged to capital 52 52 870 870 Current tax charge for the year 1,060 52 1,008 1,935 870 1,065 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 7,206,000 2008: 6,171,000 which has arisen because deductible expenses have exceeded taxable income.
This asset may be utilised in future years where there is an excess of taxable income over deductible expenses.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: investments in US equity shares and a $ liquidity fund, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and a forward foreign currency contract, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii to this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company has purchased sterling against the $ for settlement on 5th October 2011, matching the principal amount but not the maturity date of its 50 million debenture.
The counterparty to this transaction is The Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Company only hedges its currency risk in respect of the geared portion of the portfolio.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments, which are not monetary items, are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2008: 10% appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the $ which is deemed to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% 2008: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 707 785 Capital return 3,571 3,616 Total return after taxation for the year 2,864 2,831 Net assets 2,864 2,831 If sterling had strengthened by 10% 2008: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 707 785 Capital return 3,571 3,616 Total return after taxation for the year 2,864 2,831 Net assets 2,864 2,831 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into other price risk sensitivity on page 53. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
The Company held no fixed interest securities at the year end and investment in fixed interest securities has not been material at any time during the year.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash and short term deposits 501 2,899 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 8,745 14,369 Total exposure 9,246 17,268 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR and interest payable on overdrafts is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2008: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day $ London Interbank Bid Rate 2008: same.
The 50 million debenture, which the Company has in issue, carries a fixed interest rate of 6.875% until the repayment date in June 2018.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued The above year exposures are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the cash balances and investments in liquidity funds have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum exposures during the year, arising from cash balances and liquidity funds, were as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure to floating rates 29,729 37,444 Minimum interest rate exposure to floating rates 8,098 16,145 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2008: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
2009 2008 1% Increase 1% Decrease 1% Increase 1% Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 92 92 173 173 Capital return Total return after taxation for the year and net assets 92 92 173 173 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the Companys future exposure to interest rate changes, due to fluctuations in the level of cash balances and investment in liquidity funds.
iii Other price risk Other price risks include changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st December comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 357,900 331,144 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 American pp38 55 11 3 10 9:35 am Page 53 Concentration of exposure to other price risk A list of the Companys investments is given on pages 15 to 17.
This shows that all of the investments value is in the USA.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2008: 10% in equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and includes the impact on the management fee but assumes all other variables are held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2009 2008 More than More than three three Three months but Three months but months less than More than months less than More than or less one year one year Total or less one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 3,438 75,564 79,002 3,438 79,002 82,440 Securities purchased awaiting settlement 1,658 1,658 Other creditors and accruals 343 343 403 403 Performance fee payable 311 311 419 419 Performance fee provision 419419 838 838 Derivative instrument forward foreign currency contract 2,319 2,319 654 3,438 75,983 80,075 2,480 3,438 82,159 88,077 JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued The liabilities shown above against debenture stock are the undiscounted contractual amounts that are to be paid and, as such differ from the amounts shown in the balance sheet.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager regularly monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Companys assets are clearly ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore, in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading, these assets would be protected.
Credit risk exposure Compared with the balance sheet the maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end was as follows: 2009 2008 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet exposure sheet exposure 000 000 000 000 Fixed assets investments held at fair value through profit or loss 366,645 8,745 345,513 14,369 Current assets Derivative instrument 4,628 4,628 Debtors 518 518 627 627 Cash and short term deposits 501 501 2,899 2,899 372,292 14,392 349,039 17,895 The fixed asset exposure to credit risk comprises the Companys investment in the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund.
This Fund has been given a AAA credit rating by Standard & Poors.
The Funds investments comprise mainly certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and floating rate notes with a weighted average maturity of 45 days.
There has been no stock lending during the year.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying value in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of this debenture has been calculated by reference to a similar dated gilt yield plus a margin based on the 5 year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.

Capital management policies and procedures Composition of the Companys capital The Companys capital comprises the following: 2009 2008 000 000 Debt: 50,000,000 6.875% debenture June 2018 50,000 50,000 Equity: Equity share capital 10,682 10,682 Reserves 310,784 282,996 321,466 293,678 Total debt and equity 321,466 343,678 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and seek to maximise income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 95% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding liquidity fund holdings, expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
2009 2008 000 000 Investments excluding liquidity fund holdings 357,900 331,144 Net assets 321,466 293,678 Gearing 111.3% 112.8% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
