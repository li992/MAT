104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs the amendment generally eliminates the option to expense borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as incurred, and instead requires the capitalisation of eligible borrowing costs as part of the cost of the specific asset.
There is no significant impact, as the Group generally funds qualifying assets from gross cash resources and consequently does not have significant eligible borrowing costs.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements this interpretation is applicable to the Groups investments in the joint ventures operating the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft contract with the UK Ministry of Defence.
This contract commenced in 2008 and the adoption of IFRIC 12 does not have any material transitional impact.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction this interpretation applies where regulatory funding requirements will result in an unrecognisable surplus arising in the future.
It has been adopted with effect from January 1, 2008.
The impact of the adoption of this interpretation is set out in note 18.
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2009 Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
The following revisions to IFRS will be applicable in future periods, subject to endorsement where applicable: Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations and amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements are applicable for 2010.
These standards will affect the future accounting for acquisitions and transactions with non-controlling interests.
There will be no retrospective impact.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers is applicable for 2010.
This interpretation confirms the Groups existing policies for the recognition of assets received from customers and will not have a significant impact.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions are applicable from 2010.
If endorsed, these amendments will apply to the International ShareSave Scheme, but the impact is not anticipated to be significant.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is applicable from 2013.
If endorsed, this standard will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
2 Segmental analysis The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance the basis set out in IFRS 8 Operating segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, as follows: Civil aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Marine development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Energy development, manufacture, marketing and sales of power systems for the oil and gas industry and electrical power generation and aftermarket services.
Engineering and Technology, Operations and Services discussed in the business review, operate on a Group-wide basis across all the above segments.
The operating results are prepared on an underlying basis that excludes items considered to be non-underlying in nature.
The principles adopted are: Underlying revenues Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, these exclude the release of the foreign exchange transition hedging reserve and reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
There is no inter-segment trading and hence all revenues are from external customers.
Underlying profit before financing Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, this excludes the release of the foreign exchange transition hedging reserve and reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts.

This analysis also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.
The analysis for 2008 has been restated on a consistent basis.
