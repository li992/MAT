Interest income, interest expense and taxation are centrally managed and accordingly such items are not presented by segment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.
The Management Board reviews current and prior year information of subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures at constant rates of exchange which provides an approximate guide to performance in the current year if exchange rates had not changed from the prior year.
The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Groups overseas entities.
It does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by exchange rate movements.
As a result, the 2009 segmental results are translated using the 2008 average rates of exchange.

e Restructuring and integration costs Restructuring costs reflect the costs incurred as a result of initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise.
These initiatives include a review of the Groups manufacturing operations, overheads and indirect costs, organisational structure and systems and software used.
The costs of these initiatives together with the costs of integrating acquired businesses into existing operations, are included in profit from operations under the following headings: 2009 2008 m m Employee benefit costs 143 92 Depreciation and amortisation costs 107 5 Other operating expenses 61 82 Other operating income 7 19 304 160 Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 125 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 3 Profit from operations continued Restructuring and integration costs in 2009 principally relate to costs in respect of the planned closure of the Soeborg factory in Denmark, the planned downsizing of the manufacturing plant in Australia, the continued integration of ST and Tekel and the merger of Bentoel with existing Indonesian operations, as well as other restructuring initiatives directly related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise.
The costs for these other initiatives include redundancies, principally in respect of restructuring activities in the Groups subsidiary in Canada, and impairment charges for certain software assets where the development of global software solutions has resulted in these assets having minimal or limited future economic benefits.
Restructuring costs in 2008 principally relate to costs in respect of the integration of ST and Tekel into existing operations, the reorganisation of the business in the Netherlands, as well as further costs in respect of restructurings announced in 2007 and earlier years.
Other operating income in 2009 includes a gain on disposal of a property related to restructuring announced in prior years and the release of deferred income from a disposal in 2007.
In 2008, other operating income includes gains on property disposals and a gain on disposal of a non-core business in the Asia-Pacific region arising from the restructuring exercises.
f Canadian settlement On 31 July 2008, the Groups subsidiary in Canada Imperial Tobacco Canada announced that it had reached a resolution with the federal and provincial governments with regard to the investigation related to the export to the United States of Imperial Tobacco Canada tobacco products in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The subsidiary entered a plea of guilty to a regulatory violation of a single count of Section 240 i a of the Excise Act and paid a fine of 102 million which was treated as an adjusting item and included in other operating expenses in profit from operations for the year ended 31 December 2008.
At the same time, Imperial Tobacco Canada also entered into a 15 year civil agreement with the federal and provincial governments.
In order, amongst other things, to assist the governments in their future efforts against illicit trade, Imperial Tobacco Canada agreed to pay a percentage of annual net sales revenue each year for 15 years, up to a maximum of Can$350 million, which is expensed as it is incurred.
These payments are not treated as adjusting items.
g Amortisation of trademarks The acquisitions of Bentoel, Tekel and ST resulted in the capitalisation of trademarks which are amortised over their expected useful lives, which do not exceed 20 years.
The amortisation charge of 58 million is included in depreciation and amortisation costs in the profit from operations for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 24 million.
h Gains on disposal of businesses and trademarks The acquisition of the cigarette and snus businesses of ST as described in note 26 c was subject to regulatory approval which was received on the condition that the Group divest a small number of local trademarks, primarily in Norway.
The disposal of the trademarks was dealt with in two packages, with the first package sold and completed in February 2009.
In March 2009, contracts were exchanged in respect of the second package with completion in May 2009.
The total proceeds from the two packages resulted in a gain of 2 million which is included in other operating income in profit from operations for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The gain on disposal of businesses and trademarks for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 141 million, of which 139 million arose on 2 July 2008 with the disposal of the Groups 32.35 per cent holding in the non-cigarette and snus businesses of ST.
The gain was included in other operating income in profit from operations for the year ended 31 December 2008.

Facility fees relate principally to the Groups central banking facility of 1.75 billion, as well as the Groups 700 million term loan facility entered into in July 2009 2008: facilities to fund the Tekel acquisition.
Included within interest receivable is 3 million 2008: 1 million in respect of available-for-sale investments.
Included within dividend income is 2 million 2008: 1 million in respect of available-for-sale investments.
Included within exchange differences is a loss of 25 million 2008: 133 million gain in respect of items subject to fair value hedges.
IFRS requires fair value changes for derivatives, which do not meet the tests for hedge accounting under IAS 39, to be included in the income statement.
In addition, certain exchange differences are required to be included in the income statement under IFRS and, as they are subject to exchange rate movements in a period, they can be a volatile element of net finance costs.
These amounts do not always reflect an economic gain or loss for the Group and, accordingly, the Group has decided that, in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share, it is appropriate to exclude certain amounts.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 note 7 excludes, in line with previous practice, an 11 million loss relating to exchange losses in net finance costs where there is a compensating exchange gain reflected in differences in exchange taken directly to other comprehensive income.
There are no similar gains or losses in the year ended 31 December 2009.
Although the Group has adopted IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs effective from 1 January 2009, the standard does not have a material impact on the Group in 2009.

These items have been treated as adjusting items and excluded from the calculation of adjusted earnings per share as set out in note 7.
In the year ended 31 December 2009, Reynolds American recognised a trademark impairment charge of US$394 million, triggered by the increase in federal excise taxes on tobacco products and changes in pricing.
It also has an amortisation charge of US$5 million in respect of brands.
The Groups share of this charge amounted to 65 million net of tax.
During 2009, Reynolds American reviewed its post-retirement medical plans, resulting in a past service credit which is amortised under US GAAP, but under IFRS is required to be recognised in the income statement in 2009.
The Groups share of this credit amounts to 16 million net of tax.
Reynolds American also recognised a charge of US$56 million in 2009 in connection with severance and related costs of around 400 employees in order to better align staffing levels with business requirements and enable Reynolds Americans manufacturing operations to phase in new productivity programmes.
The Groups share of this charge amounted to 9 million net of tax.
In the year ended 31 December 2008, Reynolds American modified the previously anticipated level of support between certain trademarks and the projected net sales of certain trademarks, resulting in a trademark impairment charge of which the Groups share amounted to 20 million net of tax.

com annualreport2009 5 Associates and joint ventures continued On 21 February 2008, Reynolds American announced that it would receive a payment from Gallaher Limited resulting from the termination of a joint venture agreement.
While the payment will be received over a number of years, in the year ended 31 December 2008, Reynolds American recognised a pre-tax gain of US$328 million.
The Groups share of this gain amounts to 45 million net of tax.
On 9 September 2008, Reynolds American further announced planned changes in the organisational structure at Reynolds American Inc. and its largest subsidiary, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
The charge for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounted to US$90 million.
The Groups share of this charge included in the results for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounted to 12 million net of tax.
The year end of ST, an associate of the Group until 2 July 2008, was 30 June, and, for practical reasons, the Group had previously equity accounted for its interest based on the information available from ST which was three months in arrears to that of the Group.
The Group acquired 100 per cent of STs cigarette and snus businesses on 2 July 2008. ln order to account for the Groups share of the net assets of ST at the date of the acquisition, the results of ST for the period up to 2 July 2008 were included in the results from associates for 2008, resulting in one additional quarters income in 2008.
This contributed an additional 13 million to the share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures.

There are 27 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The case concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
The claim was filed in 2003 and the case was heard in the European Court of Justice ECJ in 2005 and a decision of the ECJ received in December 2006.
In July 2008, the case reverted to a trial in the UK High Court for the UK Court to determine how the principles of the ECJ decision should be applied in a UK context.
The High Court judgment in November 2008 concluded, amongst many other things, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, exempt from UK taxation.
It also concluded that certain dividends received before 5 April 1999 from the EU and, in some limited circumstances after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income with the consequence that advance corporation tax need not have been paid.
Claims for the repayment of UK tax incurred where the dividends were from the EU can be made back to 1973.
The tentative conclusion reached by the High Court would, if upheld, produce an estimated receivable of about 1.2 billion for British American Tobacco.
Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 129 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 6 Taxation on ordinary activities continued The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgment handed down on 23 February 2010.
The Court of Appeal has determined that various questions should be referred back to the European Court of Justice for further clarification.
In addition, the Court determined that the claim should be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back to 1973.
This time restriction would, if upheld, reduce the value of the claim to between zero and 10 million.
Based on advice received, the Company believes it has realistic prospects of success on further appeal and the Company has resolved to seek permission to appeal accordingly.
No potential receipt has been recognised in prior years, nor in the current year, in the results of the Group due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome.

This was in respect of a tax case pursued by the Australian Tax Office concerning the utilisation of capital losses.
The judgment has been appealed.
The tax charge for 2008 includes a one-off deferred tax charge of 26 million as a result of the acquisition of the cigarette assets of Tekel.

The costs of internally developed assets include capitalised expenses of third party consultants as well as software licence fees from third party suppliers.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and minority interests in 2009 relate to the acquisition of Bentoel as explained in note 26.
In 2008, the principal acquisitions were in respect of the Tekel cigarette assets and the cigarette and snus businesses of ST as explained in note 26, as well as a number of smaller acquisitions of minority interests in Group companies in Africa and Middle East and Europe.
The 2009 impairment charges are explained in note 3 e. Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 133 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 9 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 11,331 million 2008: 11,391 million included in intangible assets in the balance sheet is mainly the result of the following acquisitions: Rothmans Group 4,833 million 2008: 4,974 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 2,370 million 2008: 2,261 million : ETI Italy 1,463 million 2008: 1,591 million : ST principally Scandinavia 1,103 million 2008: 1,200 million : Tekel Turkey 579 million 2008: 619 million as well as 205 million relating to the Bentoel Indonesia acquisition in 2009.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Eastern and Western Europe, and South Africa 2008: Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export market in the United Kingdom and operations in Asia-Pacific.
As a consequence of the Groups new regional structure effective 1 January 2009, goodwill allocated to the Europe cash-generating unit 2008: 2,293 million has been apportioned between the new cash-generating units of Western Europe and Eastern Europe.
The goodwill on the ST transaction has been allocated between the cash-generating units of ST and Western Europe.
In 2009, goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to 16 individual cash-generating units four in Western Europe, one in Eastern Europe, two in Africa and Middle East, five in Asia-Pacific and four in the Americas.
In 2008, goodwill was allocated for impairment testing purposes to 15 individual cash-generating units five in Europe, two in Africa and Middle East, three in Asia-Pacific, three in Latin America and two in America-Pacific.
In 2009, the carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of Canada 2,370 million, Italy 1,471 million, Western Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 1,208 million, Eastern Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 1,062 million, ST principally Scandinavia 991 million, South Africa 932 million, Australia includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 746 million, Turkey 579 million, Singapore 471 million and Malaysia 426 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
In 2008, the carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 2,293 million, Canada 2,261 million, Italy 1,600 million, South Africa 833 million, Australia includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 650 million, Singapore 516 million, Malaysia 474 million and in respect of the acquisitions made during 2008, ST principally Scandinavia 1,200 million and Turkey 619 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amount of all cash-generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount of all units are the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
These assumptions have been applied to the individual cash flows of each unit as compiled by local management in the different markets.
The valuation uses cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a one year 2008: two year period, with growth in year 2 of 6 per cent.
Cash flows for the years 3 to 10 are extrapolated from year 2 cash flows at 5 per cent per annum 2008: 3 per cent, including 2 per cent inflation, whereafter a total growth rate of 2 per cent per annum 2008: zero per cent has been assumed.
The amendments to the approach in 2009 reflect changes in the Groups management reporting processes and greater consistency between the basis for the projected cash flows and the related discount rates.
The extrapolated growth rates are considered conservative given the Groups history of growth, its well balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates.
The long-term real growth does not exceed the expected long-term average growth rate for the combined markets in which the cash-generating units operate.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions or start-up ventures, the valuation is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of management, spanning five years or beyond, with the cash flow beyond these years to year 10, extrapolated by growth of 5 per cent, as above.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 7.9 per cent and 18.7 per cent 2008: 7.9 per cent to 18.7 per cent were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for economic and political risks.
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 9.7 per cent for Canada 2008: 9.7 per cent, 11.4 per cent for Italy 2008: 9.8 per cent, 9.3 per cent for Western Europe, 10.6 per cent for Eastern Europe 2008: combined Europe 9.3 per cent, 8.7 per cent for ST principally Scandinavia 2008: 8.7 per cent, 11.5 per cent for South Africa 2008: 11.5 per cent, 9.3 per cent for Australia 2008: 9.3 per cent, 13.1 per cent for Turkey 2008: 13.1 per cent, 7.9 per cent for Singapore 2008: 7.9 per cent and 10.0 per cent for Malaysia 2008: 10.1 per cent.
No goodwill impairment charges were recognised in 2009 or 2008.
If discounted cash flows per cash-generating unit should fall by 10 per cent, or the discount rate was increased at an after tax rate of 1 per cent, there would be no impairment.

While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash flows of RAI, in particular quarterly or annual periods, could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.

12 Retirement benefit schemes The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate around 160 retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally, although the Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The principal pension schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together these schemes account for over 85 per cent of the total obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
In addition, the Group operates significant schemes in Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benefits such as healthcare.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit credit method.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Pension schemes Healthcare schemes Total 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m m m Present value of funded scheme liabilities 5,222 4,623 28 24 5,250 4,647 Fair value of funded scheme assets 4,618 4,169 16 13 4,634 4,182 604 454 12 11 616 465 Minimum funding requirement obligations 75 75 Unrecognised funded scheme surpluses 52 61 52 61 731 515 12 11 743 526 Present value of unfunded scheme liabilities 148 129 134 119 282 248 Unrecognised past service cost 1 1 1 1 878 643 146 130 1,024 773 The above net liability is recognised in the balance sheet as follows retirement benefit scheme liabilities 983 718 146 130 1,129 848 retirement benefit scheme assets 105 75 105 75 878 643 146 130 1,024 773 The total accumulated net actuarial losses taken through other comprehensive income at 31 December 2009 were 886 million 2008: 591 million for subsidiaries, and 296 million 2008: 357 million net of tax for associates and joint ventures.

Discount rates are determined by reference to normal yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
For countries where there is not a deep market in such corporate bonds, the yield on government bonds is used.
Mortality assumptions are subject to regular review.
In the UK, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands the same tables were used for both years.
In the UK, for post-retirement mortality assumptions PXA92 year of birth table rated up two years for active and deferred members, with a 1.2 per cent underpin on future improvements and PXA92 year of birth table rated up three years for current pensioners with no underpin on future improvements, all with the medium cohort effect, have been used.
In Canada UP94 tables, in Germany Heubeck tables 2005G, in Switzerland EVK 2000 mortality tables and in the Netherlands GBM V 2005-2050 tables have been used.

Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2009 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these unused losses.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary differences of 1,092 million 2008: 839 million.
These unrecognised deductible temporary differences have no expiry date.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax credits of 80 million 2008: 199 million which have no expiry date.
No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these unused tax credits.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2 billion 2008: 7 billion.
This amount reflects current legislation on the taxation of cross border remittances of dividends.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

It is considered more appropriate to disclose the relevant derivatives as cash flow hedges rather than trading derivatives and therefore the comparative information in this note has been restated to reflect this treatment.
Consequently, the trading forward foreign currency contract assets and liabilities for 2008 have been reduced by 41 million and 46 million respectively, with corresponding increases in forward foreign currency contracts classified as cash flow hedges.
The disclosure of the relevant derivatives as cash flow hedges has no impact on the overall valuation of derivatives.
Certain derivatives held for trading with a settlement date greater than one year have been reclassified from current to non-current, as explained in note 1 under basis of accounting, and in accordance with IAS 1 Revised, the restated comparatives as at 1 January 2008 are: 2008 Assets Liabilities restated restated m m 1 January 2008 Current 81 215 Non-current 154 59 235 274 Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 147 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 16 Derivative financial instruments continued The maturity dates of all derivative financial instruments as recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2009 2008 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Within one year 156 127 417 841 Between one and two years 72 424 Between two and three years 23 83 83 Between three and four years 31 6 5 Between four and five years 42 40 7 Beyond five years 28 84 47 108 249 221 596 1,063 For cash flow hedges, including bifurcated hedges, the timing of expected cash flows is as follows: 2009 2008 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities restated restated m m m m Within one year 33 36 227 68 Between one and two years 50 2 29 Between two and three years 2 76 85 38 305 77 Less: bifurcated cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge note i 47 38 38 305 77 i The Group has a receive 465 million fixed rate pay DKK3,468 million fixed rate cross-currency swap which has been bifurcated into a receive 465 million fixed rate pay 368 million fixed rate cross-currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge and a receive 368 million fixed rate pay DKK3,468 million fixed rate cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge.
The above table includes the timing of expected cash flows on the bifurcated cross-currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge.
The Groups cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments.
The timing of expected cash flows in respect of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is broadly expected to be comparable to the timing of when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
The tables below set out the maturities of the Groups derivative financial instruments on an undiscounted contractual basis, based on spot rates.

The principal restructuring activities in 2009 and 2008 are as described in note 3 e. While some elements of the non-current provisions of 43 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that over 55 per cent will unwind in 2011 and approximately 80 per cent within five years.
Provisions in respect of acquired businesses mostly relate to those which were part of the integration of the Rothmans businesses in 1999 and the reorganisation of the Italian business acquired in 2003.
While some elements of the non-current provisions of 6 million will unwind over several years, it is estimated that around 60 per cent will unwind within five years.
Employee related benefits mainly relate to long-term employee benefits other than post-retirement benefits.
As the principal components of these provisions are long service awards and jubilee payments due after a certain service period, they will unwind over several years.
It is estimated that approximately 40 per cent of the non-current provisions of 28 million will unwind within five years.
Other provisions comprise balances set up in the ordinary course of general business that cannot be classified within the other categories, such as sales returns, onerous contracts, together with amounts in respect of supplier, excise and other disputes.
The nature of the amounts provided in respect of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows is difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided.
Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include 9 million 2008: 20 million for restructuring of existing businesses, nil 2008: 6 million for acquired businesses, 2 million 2008: nil for employee benefits and 90 million 2008: 15 million for other provisions.

24 Financial instruments Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specifically, Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
The approach is one of risk reduction within an overall framework of delivering Total Shareholder Return.
The Group defines capital as net debt see note 21 and equity see note 20.
The only externally imposed capital requirement for the Group is interest cover as described under interest rate risk below.
The Group assesses its financial capacity by reference to cash flow and interest cover.
Group policies include a set of financing principles including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity.
These provide a framework within which the Groups capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends as a percentage of long-term sustainable earnings and share buy-back are decided.
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Groups balance sheet and related notes.
The Groups management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers.
The Group has a target average centrally managed debt maturity of five years with no more than 20 per cent of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year.
As at 31 December 2009, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 6.6 years 2008: 5.1 years and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year was 18.4 per cent 2008: 18.3 per cent.
It is Group policy that short-term sources of funds including drawings under the 1 billion euro commercial paper ECP programme are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash.
187 million of ECP was outstanding at 31 December 2009.
The Group repaid a 900 million bond in February 2009 which was financed by bond issues during 2008 and cash generated from operations.
In May 2009, the Group repaid Malaysian ringgit MYR 100 million which was refinanced by a new MYR250 million bond in August 2009.
The additional proceeds were used to repay MYR150 million in November 2009.
During 2009, the Group also issued a new 250 million bond maturing in June 2022.

In addition, 199 million of the 350 million bond maturing in 2013 was purchased and cancelled: at the same time the Group issued a new 500 million bond with a maturity of 2034.
In the year ended 31 December 2008, the 1.8 billion revolving acquisition credit facility arranged in December 2007 was cancelled and replaced with the issue of 1.25 billion and 500 million bonds maturing in 2015 and 2024 respectively.
In addition to this, the Group increased its1 billion 5.375 per cent, maturity 2017 bond by an additional 250 million in 2008, bringing the total size of the bond to 1.25 billion.
In 2008, the Group also issued US$300 million and US$700 million bonds, maturing in 2013 and 2018 respectively, pursuant to Rule 144A and RegS under the US Securities Act.
The Group also repaid US$330 million and 217 million bonds upon maturity in May and November 2008 respectively.
In addition, in 2008, the Group repurchased its Mexican 2011 MXN1,055 million UDI bond and refinanced it with a floating rate borrowing of MXN1,444 million.
The Group continues to have a central banking facility of 1.75 billion, with a final maturity date of March 2012, which was undrawn as at 31 December 2009.
The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to inter-company loans and borrowings to ensure that there is the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group.
The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings: as at 31 December 2009 the ratings from Moodys and S&P were Baa1 BBB 2008: Baa1 BBB and these ratings were maintained throughout the year.
The strength of the ratings has underpinned the debt issuance during 2009 and 2008 and, despite the impact of the turbulence in financial markets, the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets, as demonstrated with the issue of US$1 billion bonds in the US bond market towards the end of 2008, as well as issues in the euro and sterling markets in 2009.
As part of its short-term cash management, the Group invests in a range of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, which are regarded as highly liquid and are not exposed to significant changes in fair value.
These are kept under continuous review as described in the credit risk section below.
At 31 December 2009, cash and cash equivalents include 669 million invested in money market funds 2008: 458 million.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none of them is expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Currency risk The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling.
The Groups primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Danish krone, Turkish lira, South African rand, Russian rouble, Brazilian real and Australian dollar.
These exposures are kept under continuous review.
The Groups policy on borrowings is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Within this overall policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost-effective to do so through matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
At 31 December 2009, the currency profile of the Groups gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 11 per cent 2008: 14 per cent US dollar, 54 per cent 2008: 55 per cent euro, 4 per cent 2008: 3 per cent Canadian dollar, 6 per cent 2008: 2 per cent sterling, 8 per cent 2008: 7 per cent Australian dollar and 17 per cent 2008: 19 per cent other currencies.
Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 165 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 24 Financial instruments continued The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates: these exposures are not normally hedged.
Exposures also arise from: i foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries.
These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible.
The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions: and ii forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre.
To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group hedges such flows using forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.
IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group.
All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analysis.
The Group considers a 10 per cent strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change.
The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.
A 10 per cent strengthening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 122 million higher 2008: 187 million higher and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being 268 million higher 2008: 427 million higher.
A 10 per cent weakening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 152 million lower 2008: 216 million lower and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being 328 million lower 2008: 519 million lower.
The exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income relates to hedging of certain net asset currency positions in the Group, but does not include sensitivities in respect of exchange on non-financial assets, as well as on cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions debt.
Interest rate risk The objectives of the Groups interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash flow and economic value of the Group and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants.
Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.
The Group targets gross interest cover to be between 5 and 9 and for 2009 it is 8.6 times 2008: 8.5 times.
The only externally imposed capital requirement the Group has is in respect of its centrally managed banking facilities, which require a gross interest cover of 4.5.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The Group sets targets within overall guidelines for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on both a gross 50:50 - 10 and net at least 50 per cent fixed in the short to the medium term basis as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by the Corporate Finance Committee and the board of the main central finance company.
At 31 December 2009, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 48:52 2008: 45:55 on a gross basis and 30:70 2008: 25:75 on a net basis.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to vary the fixed and floating mix.
The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.
IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
For the purposes of this sensitivity analysis, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included.
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change except where rates are less than 100 basis points.
In these instances it is assumed that the interest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero for the purpose of performing the sensitivity analysis.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 35 million lower 2008: 52 million lower.
A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, or less where applicable, would result in pre-tax profit being 34 million higher 2008: 52 million higher.
The effect of these interest rate changes on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is not material in either year.

com annualreport2009 24 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending on local practice in the countries concerned.
Certain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance provided in the Groups favour in respect of Group trade receivables, the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties.
Generally the Group targets a long-term counterparty credit rating of at least A A2 however, the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, sovereign risk can be the determining factor on the suitability of a counterparty.
From time to time the Group may invest in short dated corporate commercial paper, for this the Group has identified specific counterparties with a minimum short-term rating of A1 P1.
Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its geographic footprint, while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties.
The maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Groups balance sheet.
In addition, the Group has issued guarantees to third parties, part of which has been recognised on the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 39.
The unrecognised portion of these guarantees amounts to 84 million 2008: 66 million.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group, which are included in available-for-sale investments on the consolidated balance sheet, but the quantum of such is not material.
Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain highly effective.
Fair value estimation The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year, other than derivatives, are assumed to approximate their book values.
For other financial instruments which are measured at fair value in the balance sheet, the basis for fair values is described below.
Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 167 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 24 Financial instruments continued Fair value hierarchy The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in accordance with the IFRS 7 classification hierarchy: 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Assets at fair value Available-for-sale investments note 15 5542483 Derivatives relating to interest rate swaps note 16 108 108 cross-currency swaps note 16 15 15 forward foreign currency contracts note 16 118 118 others note 16 44 8 Assets at fair value 9 299 24 332 Liabilities at fair value Derivatives relating to interest rate swaps note 16 11 cross-currency swaps note 16 79 79 forward foreign currency contracts note 16 127 127 others note 16 14 14 Liabilities at fair value 221 221 Level 1 financial instruments are traded in an active market and fair value is based on quoted prices at 31 December 2009.
This category includes listed equity shares of 8 million.
Level 2 financial instruments are not traded in an active market but the fair values are based on quoted market prices, broker dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
Level 2 financial instruments include certain money market securities and most OTC derivatives.
The fair values of level 3 financial instruments have been determined using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Level 3 financial instruments primarily consist of an equity investment in an unquoted entity which is valued using the discounted cash flows of estimated future dividends.
The valuation assumes the following: future dividends grow by 2 per cent and a 100 basis points decrease in the growth rate would result in the valuation being 2 million lower: and discount rate of 8 per cent and a 100 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in the valuation being 4 million higher.

The price is equivalent to IDR873 per share, a premium of 20 per cent over Bentoels closing price of IDR730 per share on 17 June 2009.
A public tender offer for the remaining shares was announced after the acquisition and was completed on 26 August 2009, resulting in the acquisition of a further 14 per cent share in the company, for IDR855,783 million 52 million, bringing the total shareholding in the Bentoel Group to 99.7 per cent.
On 20 October 2009, it was announced that Bentoel and BAT Indonesia would enter into a merger plan whereby BAT Indonesia would merge into Bentoel.
This was completed with an effective date of 1 January 2010, and the total shareholding in the merged group is 99.14%.
The Bentoel name has been retained and the company remains listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange.
The goodwill of 188 million on the acquisition of the cigarette business of Bentoel, stated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction, arises as follows: Book Fair value Fair value adjustments value m m m Intangible assets 49296 Property, plant and equipment 57 21 78 Deferred tax asset 5 5 Inventories 152 13 139 Trade and other receivables 41 41 Cash and cash equivalents 33 Overdrafts 13 13 Borrowings 84 84 Retirement benefit liabilities 9 1 10 Deferred tax liabilities 29 29 Trade and other payables 48 48 Net assets acquired 108 65 173 Less: minority share of net assets acquired 1 172 Goodwill 188 Total consideration including acquisition costs of 5 million note 25 d 360 The book values of the acquired assets have been revalued to fair value as at acquisition date.
The main adjustments relate to the recognition of trademarks, the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and inventory and the related impact of deferred taxation.
The goodwill of 188 million on the acquisition of the business represents a strategic premium to enter the large Indonesian kretek market and the anticipated synergies that will arise from combining the businesses in Indonesia.
In the period from 17 June 2009 to 31 December 2009, the acquired business contributed revenue of 105 million and profit from operations of 6 million after charging 4 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles and 2 million in respect of restructuring and integration costs.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2009, before accounting for anticipated synergies, restructuring and pricing benefits, it is currently estimated that Group revenue would have been 14,291 million and Group profit from operations would have been 4,108 million for the 12 months to 31 December 2009.
These amounts have been estimated based on Bentoels results for the six months prior to acquisition, adjusted to reflect changes arising from differences in accounting policies and the anticipated effect of fair value adjustments.
The amounts reported for profit from operations are after charging 4 million for the amortisation of acquired intangibles for the period to 17 June 2009.
Financial statements and other information British American Tobacco Annual Report 2009 171 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 26 Business combinations and disposals continued b Tekel On 22 February 2008, the Group announced that it had won the public tender to acquire the cigarette assets of Tekel, the Turkish state-owned tobacco company, with a bid of US$1,720 million.
The acquisition only related to the cigarette assets of Tekel, which principally comprised trademarks, factories and tobacco leaf stocks.
The acquisition did not include employees and the Group had directly employed the required workforce by the effective date of the transaction.
Completion of this transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was subsequently received and on 24 June 2008 the Group completed the transaction subject to finalisation of the purchase price based on agreed completion accounts.
As noted in the 2008 Annual Report, part of the transaction had still to be finalised.
This occurred in 2009 with an adjustment of 12 million to the provisional purchase price of 873 million and therefore to goodwill.
The goodwill of 578 million previously 566 million on the cigarette assets of Tekel, stated at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction, arose as follows: Fair value m Net assets acquired 307 Goodwill 578 Total consideration 885 Consideration comprises cash 878 acquisition costs 7 Total consideration 885 c Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni ST On 27 February 2008, the Group agreed to acquire 100 per cent of STs cigarette and snus businesses in exchange for its existing 32.35 per cent holding in ST and payment of DKK11,582 million 1,237 million in cash.
Completion of this transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was subsequently received on the condition that the Group agreed to divest a small number of local trademarks, primarily in Norway.
The transaction was completed on 2 July 2008.
The transaction resulted in a revaluation gain of 179 million, included in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2008, and goodwill of 923 million.
The gain on disposal from this transaction and subsequent trademark disposals are explained in note 3 h. Until the date of the transaction, the results of ST were equity accounted as an associated undertaking and following the transaction, the results of the acquired businesses have been consolidated.
d Items classified as held-for-sale At 31 December 2009, 12 million of inventories and 2 million of current trade and other receivables have been presented as held-for-sale assets and 16 million of current trade and other payables have been presented as held-for-sale liabilities and relate to a non-core business being actively marketed for sale in Western Europe.
At 31 December 2008, held-for-sale assets reflect principally ST trademarks of 182 million which were disposed of in 2009 note 3 h as a condition for regulatory approval of the acquisition of the cigarette and snus businesses of ST, and 18 million of property, plant and equipment in Bologna, Italy which was sold in 2009.
Of the 16 million of property, plant and equipment acquired from Tekel classified as held-for-sale at 31 December 2008, 3 million of plant and equipment has been sold in 2009 and 1 million reclassified to property, plant and equipment as the sale of these assets is no longer highly probable.
13 million of property continues to be classified as held-for-sale at 31 December 2009.
The remainder of 2009 and 2008 held-for-sale assets comprises non-core assets in various locations being actively marketed for sale comprising plant, property and equipment of 3 million 2008: 9 million.

The expected British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the daily share price movements over a five year period.
The respective FMCG and FTSE 100 share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.
The risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by the grant share price, adjusted for the Groups announced change in dividend policy.
For grants containing earnings per share performance conditions, the payout calculation is based on the expectations published in analysts forecasts.
