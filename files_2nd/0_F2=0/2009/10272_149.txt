104 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 105 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most significant funds are described below: United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan for their UK employee, which was set up in 1993.
The scheme is a funded defined benefit arrangement with different categories of membership.
During 2009, as appointed by the Trustee of the Plan, Newton Investment Management Limited, Legal & General Investment Management Limited and Ignis Asset Management Limited were investment managers of the Plan.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2008 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2009.
The contributions of the Group during the year were 21.6% of pensionable salary, plus enhanced contributions of 1.4m per annum to remove the Plans deficit.
As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Korea The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Korea.
The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2009.
The contributions of the Group were 5.2% 2008: 8.8% of the employees earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.
The contributions of the Group were 6% 2008: 6% of the employees earnings.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 UK Korea Taiwan UK Korea Taiwan Inflation rate 3.7% 3.1% Discount rate 5.7% 6.0% 2.25% 6.5% 7.75% 2.75% Rate of salary increase 4.2% 4.0% 2.5% 3.6% 5.0% 3.0% Rate of pension increases 3.7% 3.1% Annual expected return on plan assets 6.7% 5.0% 2.25% 7.5% 5.0% 2.75% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
The expected annual return on UK plan assets for 2009 of 6.7% 2008: 7.5% has been calculated using a 7.1% 2008: 8.0% return on equity representing 73% 2008: 67% of plan assets and a 5.7% 2008: 6.5% return on bonds representing 27% 2008: 33% of plan assets.
The discount rate used in respect of the UK pension scheme of 5.7% 2008: 6.5% was based on the yield of the Merrill Lynch over-15 year AA rated corporate bond index.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED The principal cause for the UK Plan actuarial losses in 2009 is an increase in inflation, a fall in bond yields and equity values.
The principal cause for actuarial gains in 2008 was a higher discount rate applied to the liabilities net of an increase in mortality rate.
Mortality rates used reflect an industry wide recognition that life expectancy has increased.
The life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the UK Plan, based on retirement age of 65, are as follows: 2009 2008 Years Years Males 25 25 Females 28 28 Trend analysis 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 UK Korea Taiwan Other Total m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 34.7 5.4 7.3 0.7 48.1 Fair value of plan assets 22.2 5.7 2.1 30.0 Plan deficit surplus 12.5 0.3 5.2 0.7 18.1 Experience losses gains on plan liabilities 7.4 0.1 0.3 0.1 7.1 Experience losses on plan assets 0.9 0.9 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 UK Korea Taiwan Other Total m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 26.6 5.8 7.7 0.6 40.7 Fair value of plan assets 19.3 6.6 2.0 27.9 Plan deficit surplus 7.3 0.8 5.7 0.6 12.8 Experience gains on plan liabilities 6.7 0.4 7.1 Experience losses on plan assets 6.1 0.1 6.2 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 UK Korea Taiwan Other Total m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 31.5 5.3 6.4 0.5 43.7 Fair value of plan assets 22.8 6.3 1.7 30.8 Plan deficit surplus 8.7 1.0 4.7 0.5 12.9 Experience gains losses on plan liabilities 1.4 0.1 1.3 Experience losses on plan assets 0.6 0.6 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006 UK Korea Taiwan Other Total m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 31.5 5.9 6.3 0.4 44.1 Fair value of plan assets 21.3 6.3 1.5 29.1 Plan deficit surplus 10.2 0.4 4.8 0.4 15.0 Experience losses on plan liabilities 0.5 1.1 0.2 1.8 Experience gains on plan assets 0.4 0.4 108 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 109 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share option schemes which are designed to link remuneration to the future performance of the Group.
Details of these schemes are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy O iv, on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of share options and long-term incentive awards are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards.
The charge to the income statement for the year was 1.6m 2008: 1.1m.
The Group applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements at 1 January 2005 except for equity-settled employee sharebased payment arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.
The Group has granted employee equity-settled share-based payments in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.
The adoption of IFRS 2 is equity neutral for equity-settled transactions.
i Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance Share Awards under this scheme are awarded to executive Directors and senior management of the Group.

Measurement of fair value The fair value of services received in return for share options and performance share awards granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options and performance share awards granted.
The estimate of the fair value of services received is measured on a stochastic model.
The option pricing model involves six variables: Exercise price Share price at grant Expected life note a below Expected volatility of share price note b below Risk free interest rate Expected dividend yield note c below
