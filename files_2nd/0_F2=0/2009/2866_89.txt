Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group has covenanted to maintain a specified consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated net interest expense coverage ratio, the terms of which have been adhered to during the year.
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in the light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.
The Group does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to add value for shareholders.
The key discipline adopted by the Group is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital as shown in the business review on pages 25 and 33.
