Included within provisions are: i Provisions for onerous property contracts of US$158 million 2008: US$85 million, of which US$32 million 2008: US$20 million relates to discounted future costs associated with leasehold properties that became vacant as a consequence of HSBCs move to Canary Wharf in 2002.
The provisions cover rent voids while finding new tenants, shortfalls in expected rent receivable compared with rent payable and the cost of refurbishing the buildings to attract tenants.

The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
