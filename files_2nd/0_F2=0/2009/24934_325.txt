The aim of the plan was to align the interests of executives with the creation of shareholder value.
This was achieved by setting certain TSR targets against a peer group of major banks which would normally have to be attained in order for the awards to vest.
In addition to these performance conditions, none of the outstanding awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that, during the performance period, HSBC has achieved sustained growth.
Following adoption of the HSBC Share Plan in 2005, no further awards have been made under this Plan other than from reinvested dividend equivalents.
Restricted Share awards made under the Restricted Share Plan Awards of Restricted Shares were made under the Restricted Share Plan were granted to eligible employees from 2000 to 2005, after taking into account the employees performance in the previous year, their potential and retention requirements.
Restricted shares were also awarded as part-deferral of annual bonuses or for recruitment purposes.
Shares were awarded without corporate performance conditions and in most cases fully vest within three years from the date of award, providing the employees have remained continuously employed by HSBC for the period.
