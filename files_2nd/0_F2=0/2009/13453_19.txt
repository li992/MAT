53 rightmove plc annual report 2009 notes continued 1 General information continued Going concern The Group has significant cash balances of 25,893,000 at 31 December 2009 refer Note 17.
As described in Note 19, the Company entered into a revolving loan facility of 39,750,000 during 2008.
During 2009 14,750,000 of the revolving loan facility was repaid and on 16 April 2009 the Company converted 25,000,000 into a five year term loan.
In February 2010 a decision was made to repay the term loan early thereby extinguishing the debt refer Note 31.
Post repayment of the debt, the Group and the Company continued to be cash positive.
The Group met all banking covenant requirements during the year.
After making enquiries, the Board of directors has a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources and banking facilities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Board of directors continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business and Financial Review on pages 5 to 15.
The financial position of the Group, its cash ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Position on pages 11 to 15.
In addition Note 4 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Capital structure The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no.
The Company was re-registered as a public limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007.
On 28 January 2008 the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited formerly Rightmove plc, Company no.
3997679 and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement the Scheme under s425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The shares in the Company were admitted to trading on the Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and the Company immediately changed its name to Rightmove plc.
Details of the share capital of the Company are disclosed in Note 22.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The minority shareholders of Holiday Lettings Holdings Limited HLHL have a put option which if exercised requires Rightmove Group Limited to purchase their remaining 33.3% in HLHL refer Note 27.
In accordance with IAS 32, the option for the purchase of the remaining 33.3% shareholding along with the existing investment in HLHL of 66.7% has been accounted for at a consolidated level as if the Group holds 100% of the ordinary share capital in HLHL and consequently no minority interest is recognised.
HLHL management can exercise the put option from 1 July 2009 based on either a multiple of EBIT per the latest audited accounts or HLHLs market value if higher.
The impact on the consolidated statement of financial position is to recognise a liability of 8,909,000 which is based upon Rightmove Group Limiteds best estimate of likely market value for the business.
This has resulted in an increase of 2,776,000 in deferred consideration and a corresponding increase in goodwill.
Judgments and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
54 rightmove plc annual report 2009 1 General information continued In particular, information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 14 Measurement of the recoverable amounts of cash generating units containing goodwill Note 21 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Note 24 Measurement of share-based payments Note 27 Estimate of deferred purchase consideration for HLHL 2 significant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the Parent company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classication and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 permits goodwill on acquisitions made before this date to be brought onto the statement of financial position at 1 January 2004 at its carrying value under UK GAAP.
ii Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property websites.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benets embodied in the specic asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software Computer software is capitalised and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 16.7% 33.3% per annum iv Customer relationships Customer relationships are identied on the acquisition of a business and valued using discounted cash ows based on historical customer attrition rates.
Amortisation is expensed in the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Customer relationships 16.7% per annum 55 rightmove plc annual report 2009 notes continued 2 significant accounting policies continued c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Ofce equipment, xtures & ttings 20.0% per annum Computer equipment 20.0% per annum d Impairment The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and which are not available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at the IFRS transition date: no impairment was deemed necessary.
An impairment test is performed annually at 31 December on goodwill regardless of the existence of impairment indicators.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in net income.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Trade payables are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with borrowings.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts to hedge the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The Company does not specically designate forward exchange contracts as cash ow hedges and gains and losses are recorded directly in the profit or loss.
56 rightmove plc annual report 2009 2 significant accounting policies continued f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
g Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk specic to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
A provision is maintained in respect of vacant leasehold properties where the lease is considered to be onerous to take account of the net present value of residual lease commitments over the remaining term of the lease.
h Employee benets i Pensions The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme into which employees may elect to contribute via salary deduction.
Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the profit or loss when they are due.
ii Employee share schemes The share option and deferred share plans allow certain senior management to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in the profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period to which the employees become unconditionally entitled, on equity settled share-based payment schemes granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
Awards made before this date are not accounted for under IFRS 2, as permitted under the transitional rules of IFRS 1.
For awards made after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005, the charge is based on the fair value of the share-based incentives granted as at the grant date, calculated using an option pricing model.
Fair value is measured using either the Monte Carlo pricing model or Black Scholes model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates based on government bonds.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
i Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
j Revenue, iiiV iiii ]iV`} i ``i` 6 ]iVi LivViiiVvii `ii` on Group websites.
Revenue relating to properties advertised on the website is recognised in the month to which it relates.
Estate agency `ii L Vi iLi` ` Viiiii`ivii`iiViViVii` i i6 LiV}i` at the point of invoice.
New homes developers are typically billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the profit or loss on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the contract terms.
Holiday Lettings Limited HLL revenue is billed in advance.
The majority of HLL revenue relates to a 12 month period although some is billed quarterly and half yearly.
This revenue is spread equally over the period with any deferred revenue held on the statement of financial position.
57 rightmove plc annual report 2009 notes continued 2 significant accounting policies continued k Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Groups Managing Director to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
l Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss.
m Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight line basis over the lease term.
n Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances, deposits and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised on the date that the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise debt issue costs, preference dividend interest and interest payable on bank loans.
Interest payable is recognised on an accruals basis.
o Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based payments is to include the income tax effect of the excess tax deduction in the profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.
The remainder of the income tax effect of the excess tax deduction is recognised in equity.
p Dividends Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
58 rightmove plc annual report 2009 2 significant accounting policies continued q Earnings per share The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees.
The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note 11.
3 IFRSs not yet applied A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2009 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
The standards and interpretations to be adopted include: Effective date Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 1 1 2010 Amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 1 1 2010 Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Groups operations: U i`iwv Li LiiL `ii`]Viii VLi}i i` LiVL U }iV`i Lii i` v i]LiiV }iiiiV}i`w U VV]i i ``iLiV]Liiii` Vi` U ii}iii ViiLii i` v ii} iV}i`w ` U V}iiLii i` iiv i] iiii`iw Li i ` liabilities of the acquiree, on a transaction by transaction basis.
Revised IFRS 3, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, will be applied prospectively and therefore there will be no impact on prior years.
Amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 requires accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The amendments to IAS 27, which become mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
4 Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: U Vi` U ` U i U i This note presents information about the Group and Companys exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
59 rightmove plc annual report 2009 notes continued 4 Financial risk management continued The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 90.5% of the Groups customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identied loss exposures.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash.
The Group and Companys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups revenue model is largely subscription-based which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensures that they have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
Throughout the year, the Group typically had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses, before nancing activities, for a period of 277 days 2008: 113 days.
On 10 February 2010 the loan was repaid in full without penalty refer Note 31.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Currency risk More than 99.9% of the Groups sales are Sterling denominated, with the balance being Euro denominated.
As the value of Euro denominated trade receivables is low in relation to total receivables, no amounts are hedged.
HLL purchases forward exchange contracts to hedge the currency risk associated with changes in US Dollar exchange rates in respect of search marketing services supplied by Google refer to Note 29.
Interest rate risk The Group and Company have interest bearing financial liabilities.
The Group and Company are exposed to interest rate risk on the bank loan facility and cash balances.
60 rightmove plc annual report 2009 4 Financial risk management continued Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Groups processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour.
Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations.
The Groups objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Groups reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit.
This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas: U iiiv ii}i} v`i]V`}i`ii`i v V U iiiviiVV `}v V U V Vii} `ii} iii U `Vi vV `Vi`i U iiivii`V iivi v Vi`] `i `i VvV ` procedures to address the risks identied: U iiivi}vi i `i`ii` V U `iiivV}iV U } `vi `iii ` U } ]V`} ViiiivviVi Capital management The Board of directors policy is to maintain an efficient statement of financial position with an appropriate level of leverage for the size of the business so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of directors considers that the future working capital and capital expenditure requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly return on capital measures are not key performance targets.
The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders, as well as underlying earnings per share.
The Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to profit growth.
As at 31 December 2009 the directors hold 2.8% of the ordinary share capital of the Company excluding shares held in treasury.
In addition the executive directors are regarded as being interested, for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, in 6.4% 2008: 7.1% ordinary shares in the Company currently held by the EBT as they are, together with other employees, potential beneciaries of the EBT.
The Company purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions.
In April 2008 the Company entered into a revolving loan facility in order to support its continuing share buy back programme.
Of the 11,854,535 shares bought back during 2008, 9,349,105 were cancelled, with the balance transferred into treasury, providing exibility for future share-based incentives.
In 2009, 1,127,462 shares were bought back and were cancelled.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
5 Operating segments As from 1 January 2009, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the Managing Director, who is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.

Segment performance is evaluated based on revenue which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements.
All revenues in all periods are derived from third parties and there are no inter-segment revenues.
Operating costs, nancal income, financial expenses and income taxes in relation to the Agency, New Homes and the Other segment are managed on a centralised basis at a Rightmove Group Limited level and as there are no internal measures of individual segment profitability relevant disclosures have been shown under the heading of Central in the table below.
The Company has no reportable segments.
In the consolidated financial statements the revenue is spread evenly over the period of the contracted service with any deferred revenue held on the statement of financial position and accordingly an adjustment has been made to reconcile to consolidated Group revenue.
2 Operating profit is stated after the charge for depreciation and amortisation.
3 Operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2009 does not include share-based payments charge 1,896,000, Employers National Insurance NI on share-based incentives 1,310,000, the amortisation of customer relationships 84,000 and the additional segment revenue recognised by Holiday Lettings 658,000.

76 rightmove plc annual report 2009 24 Share-based payments The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for certain senior management comprising the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan Unapproved Plan, the Rightmove Approved Executive Share Option Plan Approved Plan and the Rightmove Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave.
The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured using either the Monte Carlo pricing model or Black Scholes model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
All share-based incentive schemes are granted under a service condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received.
The unapproved executive share option awards made on 5 March 2009 are subject to TSR performance over a three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250.
There are no market conditions associated with any other share-based incentives granted.
The total Group charge for the year relating to employee share-based incentive plans was 1,896,000 2008: 1,998,000.
Approved and unapproved plans The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the share option plans are as follows: Employee Share price Exercise Expected Risk free Dividend turnover Fair value at grant date price volatility Option life rate yield before vesting per option Grant date pence pence % years % % % pence 14 March 2006 Approved 413.50 410.00 27.0 7.0 4.5 4.0 16.0 92.00 15 March 2006 Unapproved 413.75 335.00 27.0 7.0 4.5 4.0 0.0 116.00 15 March 2006 Unapproved 413.75 335.00 27.0 6.0 4.5 3.0 16.0 130.00 12 October 2006 Unapproved 348.00 347.00 27.0 7.0 4.5 4.0 16.0 76.00 6 September 2007 Approved 613.00 597.00 32.0 7.0 5.8 2.0 17.0 228.00 6 September 2007 Unapproved 613.00 597.00 32.0 7.0 5.8 2.0 17.0 181.00 10 October 2007 Unapproved 525.00 522.00 32.0 6.75 5.8 2.0 17.0 189.00 5 March 2009 Unapproved 226.75 224.00 50.3 6.5 2.6 4.4 12.0 69.00 Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.

In addition certain directors contracts of employment were transferred from Rightmove Group Limited to Rightmove plc, whilst all other staff remained employed by Rightmove Group Limited.
Accordingly the IFRS 2 charge has been split between the Company and Rightmove Group Limited.
The weighted average market value per ordinary share for executive share options exercised in 2009 was 5.44 2008: no options exercised.
NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 12.8% on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
The charge for the year ended 31 December 2009 is 1,268,000.
Based on the share price as at 31 December 2008 the accrual built up in prior periods was reversed resulting in a credit to the profit and loss of 240,000 in that year.
Sharesave options The Group operates an Her Majestys Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave option scheme under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave option scheme are as follows: Employee turnover before vesting Share price Exercise Expected Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value at grant date price volatility Option life rate yield conditions per option Grant date pence pence % years % % % pence 2 October 2006 345.75 259.00 27.0 3.25 4.5 3.0 16 108.00 3 October 2007 525.00 490.00 32.0 3.25 5.8 1.5 84 156.00 2 October 2008 253.75 255.00 32.0 3.25 3.0 1.5 25 59.00 1 October 2009 545.00 425.00 50.3 3.25 3.5 4.4 25 199.00 Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave option scheme is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The weighted average market value per ordinary share for Sharesave options exercised in 2009 was 5.21 2008: no options exercised.
Deferred share plan In March 2009 a deferred share plan was established which will allow certain senior management the opportunity to earn a bonus linked as a percentage of base salary settled in deferred shares.
The award of shares in March 2010 is contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets including profit before tax relative to the Group business plan and key performance indicators such as website trafc share and customer retention.
The right to the shares will be deferred for two years from March 2010 until March 2012 and potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment.
The deferred share awards have been valued using the Black Scholes model and the resulting IFRS 2 charge has been spread evenly over the combined performance period and the vesting period of the shares, being three years.
The IFRS 2 charge for the period ended 31 December 2009 is 187,000.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 12.8% based on the share price at the period end date.
The charge for the period ended 31 December 2009 is 42,000.
The charges have been split between the Company and Rightmove Group Limited.

It is not expected that the cash ows included in the maturity analysis could occur at signicantly different amounts.
Currency risk During 2009 all the Groups sales were Sterling denominated.
As such the Group does not present sensitivity analysis for a movement in the Sterling to Euro exchange rate, nor does the Group undertake any hedging of foreign currency receivables exposure.
As at 31 December 2009 the Groups subsidiary HLL has entered into seven forward exchange contracts of USD 50,000 each which mature in 2010.
HLL purchases forward exchange contracts to hedge the currency risk associated with changes in US Dollar exchange rates in respect of search marketing services supplied by Google.
A strengthening of the US Dollar of 5% against the GBP at 31 December 2009 would have decreased equity and profit or loss by 11,000.
This analysis is based on the foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considers to be reasonably possible at 31 December 2009.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Interest rate risk The Group and the Company have exposure to interest rate risk on their cash balances and bank overdraft.
The Group and the Company has exposure to interest rate risk on the loan facility of 22,500,000 2008: 39,750,000 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%.
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased or decreased equity by 265,000 2008: 196,000.
