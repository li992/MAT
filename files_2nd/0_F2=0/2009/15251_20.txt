50 Financial statements Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 29 March 2009 1 General information Synergy Health plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group are providers of outsourced healthcare and contract sterilisation services within the UK and the rest of the world.
The Company is registered in the United Kingdom under company registration number 3355631 and its registered ofce is Ground Floor Stella, Windmill Hill Business Park, Swindon, Wilts SN5 6NX.
The 2009 financial statements are rounded to the nearest 000 and have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU Adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 92 to 101.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
On transition to IFRS the following exemptions allowed under IFRS 1 were adopted: Business combinations The Group has elected to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to the LIPS Textielservice Holding BV business combination that took place on 8 July 2004. Business combinations which took place before 8 July 2004 have not been restated.
Share-based payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payments only to share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 3 April 2005.
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment The Group has elected to take advantage of this exemption and therefore all previously revalued assets have been held at their UK GAAP carrying value as at 3 April 2005.
These values have been treated as deemed cost.
Employee benets actuarial gains and losses The Group has elected to take advantage of this exemption such that all cumulative actuarial gains and losses up to 3 April 2005 have been taken to reserves in full.
Accumulated translation reserve The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemption and has absorbed historic differences into reserves.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to the nearest weekend to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Jointly-controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of the entities assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, with items of a similar nature on a line by line basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classied as available for sale.
Going concern UK company law requires directors to consider whether it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the basis that the Company and the Group are going concerns.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executives review, and the financial position of the Group and its cash ows and borrowing requirements are described in the Finance Directors report, both of which are set out in the Business review of the Annual Report.
The Finance Directors report and note 19 to the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial risks and hedging activities together with its exposure to credit and liquidity risks.
51 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 2 Accounting policies continued The current global economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over the level of demand for the Groups products and the price of its raw materials for certain business areas and the carrying value of Group debt denominated in Foreign currency.
The directors have reviewed the Groups medium-term forecasts through to June 2010 along with reasonable possible changes in trading performance and foreign currencies arising from these uncertainties to determine whether the committed banking facilities are sufficient to support the Groups projected liquidity requirements, and whether the forecast earnings are sufficient to meet the covenants associated with the banking facilities.
The Groups committed banking facilities are due for renewal in January 2012 and no matters have been brought to the attention of the directors to suggest that renewal may not be forthcoming.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Provisional fair value allocations are reviewed and if necessary adjusted no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Provisional allocations made in the prior year have been adjusted as disclosed in note 25.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Intangible assets with a nite life are tested for impairment if there is indication of an impairment.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of the identied intangible assets are as follows: Customer-related intangibles 515 years Trade names 10 years Costs incurred in setting up long-term agreements are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the life of the contract to which the costs relate.
Technology licences are amortised from the date that they generate economic benefit and over the period of that benefit.
Financial statements and additional information 52 Financial statements Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of services but sometimes goods are also supplied, usually as part of a service offering.
Revenue is recognised once the service has been completed and the the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer.
The Group does not participate in activities which need to be accounted for under long-term contract accounting rules.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
The Group as lessee Assets held under hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
In order to manage its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see below for the details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specic borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Government grants Government grants towards staff retraining costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
53 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 2 Accounting policies continued Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs and before any profit losses on business disposals.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to dened contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a dened contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For dened benefit schemes, the cost of providing benets is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight line-basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of services or goods, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their book value, being cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with the exception of cobalt, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Leasehold improvements Period of lease Plant and machinery 520 years Ofce equipment 35 years Motor vehicles 35 years Cobalt 15 years Circulating inventory 15 years Financial statements and additional information 54 Financial statements Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Cobalt is depreciated over 15 years as follows.
The reducing balance is used for the first eight years.
The residual net book value at the end of year eight is then depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining seven years of the assets useful life.
Potential decommissioning costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated residual working life of the cobalt on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding provision is recognised in the balance sheet.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Circulating inventory mainly comprises linen textile assets provided to customers on a rental service basis in the Healthcare solutions business.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Investment property Investment properties are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost over 50 years.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets which arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a debtor and where there is no intention of trading the financial asset.
The receivables are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when objective evidence is received that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash ow statements, overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are netted off against cash.
55 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 2 Accounting policies continued Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Available for sale investment Available for sale investments are recorded at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Derivate financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses oating to xed interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these exposures.
Certain of these contracts are designated as cash ow hedges under IAS 39.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivate financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows or against net investment in overseas subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not clearly related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where appropriate.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 3 April 2005.
The Group issues equitysettled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equitysettled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model, except for the Long term Incentive Plan awards which are subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition where a model following similar principles to the Monte Carlo approach is used.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Financial statements and additional information 56 Financial statements Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The directors are of the opinion that they have made no judgements which have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Where estimates and associated assumptions are made they are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key areas of estimate uncertainty are set out below.
In relation to the Groups cobalt provision costs of future disposal are based on contractual arrangements with third parties and latest disposal cost estimates.
The Group cobalt depreciation policy is based on the actual physical decay of the cobalt 60 isotope.
In relation to the Groups property, plant and equipment note 13, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Impairment tests have been undertaken with respect to goodwill note 11 using commercial judgement and a number of assumptions and estimates have been made to support their carrying amounts.
In relation to the Groups dened benefit pension schemes, actuarial assumptions are established using relevant market benchmark data and with the advice of external qualied actuaries.
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied The IFRSs adopted by the EU applied by the Group in the preparation of these financial statements are those that were effective for the year ended 29 March 2009.
The following Adopted IFRS were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements: Endorsed IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty programmes: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 IFRIC 14 The limits on a dened benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing costs: applicable for year commencing 30 March 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 Amendment to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 Unendorsed Revised IFRS 3 Business combinations: applicable for the year commencing 1 April 2010 Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements: applicable for the year commencing 1 April 2010 IFRIC 16 Hedges of Net Investment in a Foreign Operation: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items: applicable for the year commencing 1 April 2010 Amendment to IAS 39 Reclassication of Financial Assets: Effective Date and Transition: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 Amendment to IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments: applicable for the year commencing 30 March 2009 These amendments and the new standards are not expected to impact the Group signicantly.
However, additional disclosure will be required.

63 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 11 Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired on a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as shown in the table below.
This table also provides the assumptions used by management in assessing the carrying value of these amounts: 2009 2008 Discount Long-term Discount Long-term rate growth rates rate growth rates % % '000 % % '000 UK segment Healthcare solutions 10.9 5 23,156 85 23,184 Decontamination services 10.9 46 4,654 85 4,654 Sterilisation services 10.9 5 33,516 85 33,468 Rest of Europe segment Healthcare solutions 10.9 34 30,858 85 24,594 Sterilisation services 10.9 5 82,997 85 70,379 Rest of World a single CGU 10.9 8 21,933 88 17,758 197,114 174,037 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a CGU, to their recoverable amount based on a value in use calculation.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment results.
During the year the goodwill for each CGU was separately assessed and tested for impairment, with nil 2008: nil impairment charges resulting.
As part of testing goodwill for impairment, detailed forecasts of operating cash ows for a period of up to five years are derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management.
Cash ows for the period beyond the financial forecasts are extrapolated based on estimates of future growth rates as disclosed above.
For each CGU the future growth rates used in the recoverable amount calculation do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets to which the CGU is dedicated.
The directors are of the view that the relative risks of the CGUs are such that it is appropriate to use the same discount rate to calculate value in use for each segment.
A number of key assumptions are used as part of impairment testing.
These key assumptions are made by management reecting past experience combined with their knowledge as to future performance and relevant external sources of information.
In determining the recoverable amount of each CGU the key assumptions are discount rate, long-term growth rate, future sales prices and volumes, new business won and the cost structure of each business.
Sensitivity analysis as at 29 March 2009 has indicated that no reasonable foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model will result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

Other intangibles relate to purchased technology licences and pre-contract costs.
During the year 500,000 of pre-contract costs relating to reimbursed customer expenses have been reclassied to prepayments and accrued income as they are more appropriately recognised in this category.
This reclassication has been netted off additions in the year.
The Group tests other intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The carrying amount of the Groups plant and equipment includes an amount of 14.8 million 2008: 12.8 million in respect of assets held under hire purchase loan contracts.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for impairment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
For further disclosure on credit risk see note 19.

These loans attract a oating rate of interest although xing arrangements have been entered into as described in note 19.
Certain Euro denominated loans outside of the main syndicated facility of 16 million are secured by a mortgage on certain Dutch properties.
The loans attract a oating rate of interest.

19 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Financial statements and additional information 70 Financial statements Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 19 Financial instruments continued b Interest rate risk The Group is subject to uctuations in interest rates on its loans and surplus cash deposits.
At 29 March 2009 the Group held hedging arrangements in order to x an element of interest on a total of 88.8 million of its debt.
Amounts to be paid or received under these arrangements will be recognised in the interest expenses consistent with the terms of the agreement.
The expiry of each agreement is disclosed in the table above.
The arrangements are fully effective in xing the interest on the underlying debt.
In revaluing them to fair value, the Group has recognised 2,524,000 in current liabilities and equity.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the element of the total Group interest which is not subject to xed interest arrangements.
The reasonable change is based on the difference between current market interest rates and one year forward rates: Increase decrease Effect on profit after tax and equity in basis points 000 2009 43 43 314 314 2008 67 67 278 278 c Foreign currency risk The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has investment in overseas operations which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk in respect of its overseas operations.
Whilst the exposure is limited the Groups principal currency exposure is to uctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro.
During the 12 months to March 2009 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro has weakened by 15% in comparison to the 12 month average to March 2008.
A 15% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro over the entire year to March 2009 would have resulted in increased equity and profit after tax of 1,465,000 2008: 921,000.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 15% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro would have an equal but opposite effect.
The costs of mitigating any exposure to movements in foreign currency earnings from subsidiaries currently would outweigh the benets.
71 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 19 Financial instruments continued Where the Group subsidiaries make significant purchases in non-functional currencies, such as US and Canadian Dollars, the Group enters into forward exchange currency contracts to manage this exposure.
During the 12 months to March 2009 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar has weakened by 15% in comparison to the 12 months average to March 2008.
A 15% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar over the entire year to March 2009 would have resulted in reduced equity and profit after tax of 600,000 2008: 322,000.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
A 15% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar would have an impact of 440,000.
Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash ows in foreign currencies and is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in the functional currencies of the Groups trading entities and its suppliers.
At the balance sheet date, the total amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Forward foreign exchange contracts future contracted cash ow 3,991 733 Investment value recognised in balance sheet 55 27 Fair value at balance sheet date 3,936 760 At 29 March 2009, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be approximately 3,936,000 liability.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
In revaluing these contracts to fair value, the Group has recognised 55,000 in current liabilities and equity as all contracts have been designated as fully effective and qualify for cash ow hedge accounting.
At 30 March 2008, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives was estimated to be approximately a 760,000 liability.
In revaluing these contracts to fair value at 30 March 2008 the Group recognised 27,000 in current assets and equity.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specic exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the underlying hedged item until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Additionally, the Group holds Euro denominated loans in UK companies totalling 117 million.
This represents a fully effective designated net investment hedge against the first 117 million of the Groups Euro denominated net assets of 240 million.
The revaluation of these loans resulted in a loss of 11 million which has been posted to the translation reserve.
d Credit risk Financial risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor exposure to risk on an ongoing basis.
These include the use of customer specic credit limits based on third party credit reports and in cases of customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was 48,470,000 2008: 46,996,000 being the total trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
The Groups customer base mainly comprises major medical device companies, commercial distributors, NHS Trusts and healthcare providers, including public sector, private sector and charitable organisations, throughout the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.
No single customer or top 10 customer grouping accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables.
The Group has in place an insurance policy to cover a larger portion of its Healthcare solutions UK export customers.

The movement in the allowance for impairment of receivables during the year was as follows: 2009 2008 Group 000 000 Balance at 30 March 2008 914 322 Arising in acquisition of subsidiary 504 Impairment loss recognised 277 88 Utilisation of impairment provision 77 Balance at 29 March 2009 1,114 914 The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible, at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.
No further analysis has been provided for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables from Group companies, other trade receivables and other financial assets as there is limited exposure to credit risk and no provisions for impairment have been recognised.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Details of the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities are given in note 18.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are: i. to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benets to other stakeholders: and ii.
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by a pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk and b ensuring the returns on new investment programmes will maintain or increase shareholder returns.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares, if required.
The acquisition of Isotron in 2007 was partially funded by issue of equity to maintain an appropriate capital structure for the Group.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 29 March 2009 and 30 March 2008.
The table below presents the quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2009 2008 000 000 Shareholders funds 252,788 219,867 Bank overdraft 51 Finance leases 11,449 10,469 Bank loans 161,307 135,445 Other interest bearing loans 3,044 3,307 428,588 369,139 73 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 20 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.

Accordingly the previous years acquired balances have been adjusted.
Included in the 2007 UK budget were proposed changes to the capital allowances regime in respect of Industrial buildings which may impact the Group.
The stated intention was to reduce the allowances given from 4% straight line to 3% from April 2008, 2% from April 2009, 1% from April 2010 and nally to abolish Industrial Building Allowances from April 2011.
These changes were enacted during the year ended 29 March 2009.
The accounting implications of the changes have been reviewed and, consistent with the interpretation of IAS 12 Income taxes, no adjustment has been reected.
The Group has deferred tax assets of 1 million 2008: 1 million in respect of tax losses that have not been recognised as their recoverability is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where appropriate.
The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2008 2009 as restated 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 17,001 18,444 The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which no deferred tax has been provided is 191,000,000.
No taxation is expected to arise in respect of this temporary difference.

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 61 days 2008: 53 days.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

Accordingly, the interest to date has been accrued and reected in the income statement.
The cobalt disposal cost provision recognises a potential decommissioning liability in respect of particular types of cobalt used at UK Commercial sites.
It is anticipated that the provision will be utilised as the cobalt to which the provision relates reaches the end of its useful economic life.
Other provisions include provisions against rent payable on properties now vacated and other restructuring costs, mainly in relation to the Shiloh acquisition, which was made in August 2005, and the closure of three linen sites, two in the Netherlands and one in the UK.
These costs will be payable over the next three years.

Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2005.
All executive directors and senior executives nominated by the Remuneration Committee are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under the LTIP.
The awards take the form of an option over shares, where granting the option is conditional upon the performance of the Company over the measurement period.
An award made under the LTIP to a nominated participant will take two forms.
a The first type of award is a right to acquire a specified number of shares by way of an option LTIP Option, with award conditional upon the performance of the Company over the measurement period.
Other than the initial award, the policy will be to make maximum awards not exceeding 200% of basic salary.
The maximum initial award made in July 2005 in respect of R M Steeves and I M Jacques was 450% of basic salary.
85 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 29 Share-based payments continued The vesting of the shares will be dependent on the extent to which the following performance targets have been satisfied: i 50% of the LTIP Option is determined by a comparison of the earnings per share gure at the end of the measurement period with that at the start.
For these purposes earnings per share will be adjusted for goodwill, non-recurring items, share option charges and any other items deemed reasonable by the Remuneration Committee.
ii The other 50% of the LTIP Option is determined by the Total Shareholder Return TSR generated by the Company in comparison to that generated by companies in the FTSE Small Companies excluding investment trusts Index.
A table ranking the companies in order of performance will be produced in July of each year of the measurement period, the ranking of the Company in that table will be established.
b The second type of award takes the form of a co-invest arrangement and requires that the participant to whom the award is to be made invests in Shares in the Company and continues to hold those shares throughout the measurement period LTIP Co-invest.
At the end of the measurement period, depending upon the growth in earnings per share adjusted as above of the Company over the measurement period, the participant will receive a number of matching shares at nominal value under the LTIP Co-invest.

The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.

91 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 30 Retirement benefit schemes continued Scheme 6 Lips Textielservice LTS participates in a multi-employer industry-wide dened benefit scheme.
The plan is managed by the industry pension fund and obligations are reinsured.
In the event that there is an under-funding position the trustees of the scheme can take a range of actions including increasing employee contributions and reducing member benets as well as asking employers to increase their contributions.
LTS is unable to identify the Companys share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan because the plan is industry-wide and cannot accurately determine the Companys share of the overall surplus deficit of the plan.
However, to the extent that a surplus of deficit in the plan may affect the amount of future contributions, the Company will be required to recognise its share of these obligations.
Under the specic exemptions within IAS 19, the scheme is therefore treated as a dened contribution scheme within the Group financial statements.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of this scheme was 2,037,000 2008: 1,519,000.
31 Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
The Groups share of the net assets and income of the jointly controlled entity are disclosed in note 15.
