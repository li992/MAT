The lower effective tax rate is due to a combination of lower corporate tax rates in a number of jurisdictions, in particular Taiwan and Korea, profit mix and prior year adjustments.
Excluding the impact of changes in corporate tax rates on brought forward deferred taxes and adjustments in respect of previous years, the Groups underlying effective tax rate is 33.2% 2008: 30.2%.
A tax charge of 2.3m 2008: 2.8m relating to joint ventures and associates is included in the reported profit before tax.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONTINUED Major adjustment factors affecting the 2009 tax expense: Effect of changes in tax rates The credit of 9.9m relates to reduction in tax rate in Taiwan and Korea.
Adjustments in respect of prior years The Groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The geographical complexity of the Groups structure makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and it is often dependent on the efficacy of the legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
