NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Overview Travis Perkins plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 125.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executives review of the year, the Chief Operating Officers review of the year and the Finance Directors review of the year on pages 10 to 43.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
As such, the results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition.
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007, IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset.
The adoption of IFRIC 13 and IFRIC 14 has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
As a result the segmental information included in note 6 is presented in accordance with IFRS 8.
IAS 1 revised requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income.
As a result a consolidated statement of changes in equity has been included in the primary statements showing the changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
IFRS 7 now requires that an entity should classify its financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in measuring the fair value of those instruments.
The additional disclosures are included in note 25.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not yet been applied in these financial statements, were in issue, but not yet effective: Amendments to various standards arising from annual improvements issued in April 2009: IFRS 2 issued June 2009 Share based payments cash settled transactions: IAS 24 issued November 2009 Related party Disclosures: IAS 27 revised 2008 Amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3: IAS 31 revised 2008 Amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3: IAS 32 revised 2009 Amendments relating to classification of rights issues: IFRS 9 issued November 2009 Financial Instruments.
The Directors anticipate that adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The Directors are currently of the opinion that the Groups forecasts and projections, show that the Group should be able to operate within its current facilities and comply with its banking covenants.
The Group is, however, exposed to a number of significant risks and uncertainties which could impact on the Groups ability to meet the Directors forecast and projections and hence its ability to meet its banking covenants.
The Directors believe that the Group has the flexibility to react to changing market conditions and is adequately placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook and challenging macro economic conditions.
A detailed consideration of going concern, risks and uncertainties is provided on page 38 of the Finance Directors review of the year.
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements are set out below.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when goods or services are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and value added tax.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items of income and expenditure that by reference to the Group are material in size and unusual in nature or incidence, that in the judgement of the Directors, should be disclosed separately on the face of the financial statements or in the notes in the case of a segment to ensure both that the reader has a proper understanding of the Groups financial performance and that there is comparability of financial performance between periods.
Items of income or expense that are considered by the Directors for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, such items as significant restructurings, onerous contracts, write-downs or impairments of current and non-current assets, the costs of integrating acquired businesses, gains or losses on disposals of businesses, investments or individual assets, re-measurement gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to the extent that hedge accounting is not achieved or is not effective and pension scheme curtailment gains.
Business combinations and goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition represents the cash value of the consideration and or the fair value of the shares issued on the date the offer became unconditional, plus expenses.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
It is this fair value, which is incorporated into the consolidated accounts.
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the share of the aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets including intangible assets of a business or a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
All material intangible fixed assets obtained on acquisition have been recognised separately in the financial statements.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset and allocated to cash generating units, then at least annually, is reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed, as such, goodwill is stated in the balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment in value.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Intangible assets Intangible assets identified as part of the assets of an acquired business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over a maximum of 20 years except where they are considered to have an indefinite useful life.
In the latter instance they are reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment properties Investment properties, which are held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, are stated at deemed cost less depreciation.
Properties are depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, up to a maximum of 50 years.
Rental income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Assets are depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Buildings 50 years or if lower, the estimated useful life of the building or the life of the lease Plant and equipment 4 to 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated 80 N O T E S T O T H E F I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S 17334 proof 3 1 4 10 Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds net of expenses and the carrying amount of the asset in the balance sheet and is recognised in the income statement.
Where appropriate, the attributable revaluation reserve remaining in respect of properties revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS is transferred directly to accumulated profits.
Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Reverse lease premia and other incentives receivable for entering into a lease agreement are recognised in the income statement over the life of the lease.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill The carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets other than investment properties, deferred tax assets and inventories are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such an indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to its carrying value.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount a provision for the impairment loss is established with a charge being made to the income statement.
For intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life the recoverable amount is estimated at each annual balance sheet date.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Inventories Inventories, which consist of goods for resale, are stated at the lower of average weighted cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost which is carrying amount less provision for irrecoverable amounts.
Allowances for the estimated irrecoverable amounts are made in the income statement when the receivable is considered to be uncollectible.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are treated as impaired when in the opinion of the Directors, the likelihood of full recovery is diminished either by events or change of circumstance.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank and other borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and other loans are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Finance charges associated with arranging a bank facility are recognised in the income statement over the life of the facility.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling on the date of the transaction.
At the consolidated balance sheet date, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
N O T E S T O T H E F I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S 81 17334 proof 3 1 4 10 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from financing activities.
The Group does not enter into speculative financial instruments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest and exchange rates and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are designated and effective as hedges of the future variability of cash flows, are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in commercial contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the underlying contracts, with unrealised gains or losses being reported in the income statement.
The fair value of hedged derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months, otherwise they are classified as current.
Foreign currency forward contracts are not designated effective hedges and so are marked to market at the balance sheet date, with any gains or losses being taken through the income statement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available-for-sale AFS financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
The Group has defined the classes of financial assets to be other financial assets, cash and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial asset or the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as FVTPL.
A financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if: It has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling or of disposal in the near future: or It is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking: or It is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement unless it is an effective cash flow relationship.
The net gain or loss recognised in the income statement incorporates any interest earned or paid on the financial asset and financial liability respectively.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables which applies to all amounts owed to the Group when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire: or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and the deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible.
The 82 N O T E S T O T H E F I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S 17334 proof 3 1 4 10 Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
This is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits For defined benefit schemes, operating profit is charged with the cost of providing pension benefits earned by employees in the period.
The expected return on pension scheme assets less the interest on pension scheme liabilities is shown as a finance cost within the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the period from the difference between actual and expected returns on pension scheme assets, experience gains and losses on pension scheme liabilities and the effects of changes in demographics and financial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
Recoverable pension scheme surpluses and pension scheme deficits and the associated deferred tax balances are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are included in the balance sheet.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Employee share incentive plans The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees long term incentives, executive share options and Save As You Earn, which do not include market related conditions.
These payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by the use of the Black Scholes option-pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Equity instruments and own shares The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Equity instruments represent the ordinary share capital of the Group and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid by the Group for its own shares is deducted from total shareholder equity.
Where such shares vest to employees under the terms of the Groups share options or the Groups share save schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions.
The Directors constantly re-evaluate these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.
The Directors believe that the following accounting policies are critical due to the degree of estimation required and or the potential material impact they may have on the Groups financial position and performance: Inventory valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
N O T E S T O T H E F I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S 83 17334 proof 3 1 4 10 The level of inventory provisioning required is sensitive to changes in the forecast sales of particular products which is dependent on changes in conditions in the Groups markets.
If changes in actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected, additional inventory provisions may be required: similarly if changes in actual market conditions are more favourable than predicted, it may be possible to release a proportion of the inventory provision.
Debtor recoverability The Group provides credit to a significant number of its customers.
At each period end an assessment is made of the extent to which those customers may not pay amounts due to the Group and a doubtful debt provision is established accordingly.
Determining the likelihood of the Group incurring bad debts requires the Directors to exercise judgement.
To the extent this judgement ultimately proves to be inaccurate it would change the profit for the period.
Provisions for returns and warranty claims The products sold by the Group are covered by warranties given to it by the suppliers from whom the goods are bought.
Should any of those suppliers cease to trade then any liabilities for product warranties would rest with the Group.
In such circumstances the Directors would have to estimate the value of any provision required to meet the obligations of the Group.
At the balance sheet date the Directors have estimated that there is no need for any material warranty and product guarantee provisions to be made.
While the Directors believe that the Groups warranty provisions are adequate and that the judgements applied are appropriate, the ultimate cost of product warranty could differ materially from the estimates.
Income taxes The Group is subject to the income tax laws of the United Kingdom.
These laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and tax authorities.
When establishing income tax provisions, the Directors make a number of judgements and interpretations about the application and interaction of these laws.
Changes in these tax laws or in their interpretation could impact the Groups effective tax rate and the results of operations in a given period.
The process of estimating the Groups tax position requires an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are included within the consolidated balance sheet to the extent that we believe they are recoverable.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group considers profit forecasts including the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on sales and external market conditions.
The Directors judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where the Directors believe there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future to realise deferred tax assets.
Although the deferred tax assets which have been recognised are considered realisable, actual amounts could be reduced if future taxable income is lower than expected.
This can materially affect the Groups reported net income and financial position.
Goodwill In testing for impairment, the Directors have made certain assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and three-year plan.
Whilst the Directors consider these assumptions are realistic should these assumptions regarding the growth in profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
Further details concerning the impairment of goodwill and intangibles are given in note 14.
Pension liabilities The Group has chosen to adopt assumptions that Directors believe are in line with the median.
If the future return on equities is lower than anticipated, or if the difference between actual inflation and the actual increase in pensionable salaries is greater than that assumed, or if the average life expectancy of pensioners increases, then the pension deficit would be greater than currently stated in the balance sheet.
Property leases The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading.
Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible.
Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant if any for the period up until the point it is judged that the lease will no longer be onerous.
The Directors believe that their estimates, which are based upon the current state of the UK property market, are appropriate.
However, it is possible that it may take longer to dispose of leases than they anticipate.
As a result the provisions may be understated, but in the opinion of the Directors this is unlikely to be material.
Insurance provisions The Group has been substantially self-insured since 2001.
The nature of insurance claims is that they frequently take many years to fully crystalise, therefore the Directors have to estimate the value of provisions to hold in the balance sheet in respect of historic claims.
Under the guidance of the Groups insurance advisors, the value of incurred claims is estimated using the Generalised Cape Cod Method.
The provision is determined by deducting the value of claims settled to date from the estimated level of claims incurred.
Whilst the Generalised Cape Cod Method is an insurance industry standard methodology, it relies on historic trends to determine the level of expected claims.
To the extent that the estimates are inaccurate the Group may be underprovided, but in the opinion of the Directors any under-provision is unlikely to be material.

The total charge of 56.2m includes a cost of redundancy and re-organisation 10.5m onerous property lease provisions 39.5m and asset write offs 6.2m.
40.4m and 15.8m were included in selling and distribution costs and administration expenses respectively.
To enable readers of the financial statements to obtain a clear understanding of underlying trading, the Directors have shown separately the exceptional items in the group income statement.

In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical using a risk and returns approach.
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into two operating divisions Merchanting and Retail, both of which operate entirely in the United Kingdom.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reported its primary segment information under IAS 14 and following a review are the segments that are most appropriate to be reported under IFRS 8.
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of share of losses of associates, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
There are no significant inter-segment sales.
During 2009 and 2008 there were no impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss or in equity in either of the reportable segments.

PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit scheme During the year, the Group operated a final salary scheme: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the Scheme, which is a 1 60th scheme.
The Scheme is funded by contributions from group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the Scheme every three years.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the Scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out on 30 September 2008.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2008 valuation, then updated to 31 December 2009 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the Scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
a Major assumptions used by the actuary at the balance sheet date in nominal terms At At 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.5% 4.0% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.4% 2.3% Discount rate 5.7% 6.2% Inflation assumption 3.5% 3.0% In respect of longevity the valuation adopts the PMA PFA92 tables with improvements in life expectancy to continue in the medium term, with base year appropriate to the members date of birth.
This results in the following life expectancies at illustrative ages: Weighted average life expectancy for mortality tables used to determine pension liability at 31 December 2009: Male Years Female Years Member age 65 current life expectancy 21.6 24.8 Member age 45 life expectancy on reaching age 65 23.4 26.7 b Amounts recognised in income in respect of the defined benefit scheme 2009 2008 m m Current and past service costs charged to operating profit in the income statement 5.8 8.9 Interest cost 30.4 31.8 Effect of curtailment 32.7 - Expected return on scheme assets 27.8 36.6 Total pension income costs 24.3 4.1 The total charge to the profit and loss account disclosed in note 7 of 9.0m 2008: 11.9m comprises defined benefit scheme current and past service costs of 5.8m 2008: 8.9m and 3.2m 2008: 3.0m of contributions made to the defined contribution schemes note 8j.
The Company and Trustee agreed to amend the benefits of the TP scheme with effect from 1 December 2009 to include a cap on future pensionable salary increases of 3% per annum.
This has been treated as a curtailment event and the resulting reduction in the benefit obligation has been included as a curtailment gain in 2009 note 5.
The directors have agreed with the Scheme Actuary and the Trustee to pay contributions of 20.4m in excess of the forecast charge to the income statement.
Note 5 shows where pension costs have been charged in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses have been included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The following disclosures relate to share option and SAYE grants made after 7 November 2002.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2009 2008 Executive Nil price Executive Nil price options SAYE options options SAYE options Share price at grant date pence Group 653 794 619 586 702 790 Option exercise price pence Group 663 636 - 589 562 - Share price at grant date pence Company 653 794 619 589 702 790 Option exercise price pence Company 663 636 - 589 562 Volatility % Group and Company 61.0% 50.7% 60.1% 21.3% 21.4% 21.3% Option life years Group and Company 3.0 3.5 3.0 4.0 3.8 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % Group and Company 2.2% 2.1% 2.4% 3.6% 4.2% 3.9% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % Group and Company 1.6% 2.0% 1.6% 2.4% 2.1% 2.4% Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of 3 times.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon the Directors best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is 5.4m for the Group and 0.2m for the Company.
Shares were granted under the share matching scheme on 19 May 2009.
The estimated fair value of the shares at that date was 5.7m for the Group and 2.6m for the Company.

GOODWILL The Group Retail Merchanting Group m m m Cost At 1 January 2008 958.1 371.6 1,329.7 Recognised on acquisitions during the year 11.8 9.9 21.7 At 1 January 2009 969.9 381.5 1,351.4 Recognised on acquisitions during the year - 1.4 1.4 At 31 December 2009 969.9 382.9 1,352.8 Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses during the year was allocated to those cash generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from those acquisitions.
With the exception of the Wickes business no individual CGU is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
At 31 December 2009, before impairment testing, goodwill and intangibles note 15 of 882.4m million was allocated to Wickes, 26.8m to Tile Giant and 606.1m to the Merchanting business.
On the acquisition of the Wickes business, 250m of goodwill, which represented synergies arising from the acquisition, was allocated to the merchanting CGU.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions have been reviewed during the year in light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future and the changing capital structure of the Company.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
As a result of these deliberations the discount rate has been amended to reflect changes in the capital structure arising from the rights issue.
The turnover growth rates in each CGU are based on the Directors expectations for the next 5 years.
Growth is predicted to be lower than in previous years as a result of the difficult economic conditions that are directly affecting the construction and related industries.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs used in the calculations are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
It is anticipated that like-for-like sales volumes which fell during 2009, will flatten out for a period before resuming growth at a point in 2010.
At the beginning and end of the financial period the fair value of goodwill and intangibles in both segments was in excess of its book value.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts which were derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the three years ending 2013, which were approved by the directors.
Cash flows for the following year are extrapolated from cash flows for 2013 using similar assumptions to those applied to 2013: The weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group of 8.6%: Long-term forecast growth rates of 2.5% in line with the average long-term GDP growth trend applied from 2014 onwards.
Whilst the Directors believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results: Changes to the way the assets are used or our strategy for the business: A deterioration in the industry or the economy.
The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
These calculations are sensitive to changes in future cash flows, the discount rate applied and the terminal growth rate.
The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the assumptions that would result in an impairment to goodwill and intangibles of 100m: Merchanting Wickes Weighted average cost of capital 23.2% 13.5% Long term growth rate reduction 29.0 % 4.3 % The Company has no goodwill.

As a leading brand in the DIY sector, with significant growth prospects, it is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is reviewed annually for impairment.
Details of impairment testing are given in note 14.
No impairments were identified in either year.
The Company has no intangible assets.

The investment presents the Group with an opportunity to generate returns through both income and capital gains.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of this investment approximates its fair value.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS T h e G r o u p T h e C o M p A N Y 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Trade receivables 279.5 295.2 - - Allowance for doubtful debts 34.5 32.3 - - 245.0 262.9 - - Amounts owed by subsidiaries - - 49.0 36.9 Other receivables, prepayments and accrued income 130.4 123.3 1.8 19.9 Trade and other receivables 375.4 386.2 50.8 56.8 The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, which for the Group at the balance sheet date comprise principally of amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due in respect of rebates and sundry prepayments.
The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term for sales of goods is 54 days 2008: 57 days.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts of 34.5m 2008: 32.3m, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at 4% above the National Westminster Bank base rate per annum on the outstanding balance.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables outstanding over 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables not receivable for up to 90 days are specifically provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS continued Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts T h e G r o u p 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 32.3 21.5 Amounts written off during the year 10.2 6.0 Increase in allowance recognised in profit and loss 12.4 16.8 At 31 December 34.5 32.3 In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are unprovided debtors with a carrying amount of 20.9m 2008: 28.9m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
Except for some instances of personal guarantees the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the amount it is anticipated will be recovered.
None of the Companys debts are overdue.
The directors do not consider there to be any significant credit risk, as the majority of the debt is due from subsidiaries.
CASH AND CASH EqUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and Company and short-term bank deposits.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
SHARE CAPITAL T h e G r o u p A N D T h e C o M p A N Y Authorised Issued and fully paid Ordinary shares of 10p No.
The total gross proceeds were 313.5m with issue costs of 13.2m.
The issue costs have been charged to the share premium account.
The Company has one class of ordinary share that carries no right to fixed income.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.

The acquisition of these shares was funded by the sale of nil paid rights.
RESERVES Details of all movements in reserves for both the Group and Company are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
A description of the nature and purpose of each reserve is given below.
The other reserve represents the revaluation surplus that has arisen from property revaluations in 1999 and prior years.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have yet to occur.
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares purchased in the market and held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust to satisfy options under the Groups share option schemes.
The cumulative total of goodwill written off directly to reserves for acquisitions from December 1989 to December 1998 is 40.1m.
The aggregate information for the accounting periods prior to this period is not available.

Excluding 999 year leases, the average loan term for these properties is 49 years and the average borrowing rate has been determined at the inception of the lease to be 8.9%.
In addition the Group leases certain fixtures and equipment under finance leases, the obligations for which are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The average lease term is 3-4 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the average implicit borrowing rate was 13.4% 2008: 14.9%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All lease obligations, which are denominated in Sterling, are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
e Loan notes Included in borrowings due within the year are 3.8m 2008: 3.9m in respect of loan notes issued as consideration for the acquisition of two groups during 1999 and 2000.
The loan notes of 0.3m issued in 1999 to acquire Sharpe and Fisher can be redeemed on 31 January and 31 July each year, the final redemption date being 31 January 2010.
The 3.5m of loan notes issued for the acquisition of the business of Broombys Limited are redeemable on 30 June and 31 December each year until the final redemption date of 30 June 2015.
BORROWINGS continued f Interest The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Unsecured senior notes 5.8 5.8 Bank loans and overdraft 2.2 6.3 Other borrowings 5.4 5.1 Bank term loans and revolving credit facilities of 1,000m 2008: 1,000m were arranged at variable interest rates.
The $400m unsecured senior notes were issued at fixed rates of interest and swapped into variable rates.
This exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
As detailed in note 25, to manage the risk the Group enters into interest rate derivatives arrangements, which for the first four months of 2009, fixed interest rates on an average of 635m of borrowings and for the last eight months fixed interest rates on an average of 630m of borrowings.
For the year to 31 December 2009 this had the effect of increasing the weighted average interest rates paid by 2.0%.
In respect of income earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.

There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 25. h Guarantees and security There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts between group companies.
The companies listed in note 18, with the exception of Benchmarx Kitchens and Joinery Limited and Tile Giant Limited, together with Wickes Limited are guarantors of the following facilities advanced to Travis Perkins plc: 525m term loan: 475m revolving credit facility: $400m unsecured senior notes note 24 i : Interest rate and currency derivatives, note 25.
The group companies have entered into other guarantee and counter-indemnities arrangements in respect of guarantees issued in favour of group companies by the clearing banks amounting to approximately 13.7m 2008: 13.2m.
BORROWINGS continued i Unsecured senior notes On 26 January 2006 the Group finalised a US private placement that resulted in it receiving $400m.
$200m of the unsecured senior notes is repayable in January 2013 and $200m in January 2016.
The US borrowings carry fixed rate coupons of between 130 bps and 140 bps over US treasuries.
As described in note 25, to protect itself from currency movements and bring interest rate exposures back into line with the Groups desired risk profile the Group entered into five cross currency swaps.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.

Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is either on a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swaps.
As part of their interest rate management processes, in respect of the facilities described in note 24, the Group and the Company at the commencement of the year, were parties to two amortising interest rate swaps, four non-amortising interest rate swaps, two non-amortising interest rate swaps with a call option, one amortising interest rate floor option and an amortising interest rate cap option.
In May 2009 the Group and the Company paid 28.7m to exit from all the above swaps and options with the exception of one non-amortising interest rate swap with a call option.
In May 2009, as part of their interest rate management processes, in respect of the facilities described in note 24, the Group and Company entered into four amortising swaps each with an initial notional value of 100m, two amortising swaps with an initial notional value of 50m and two non-amortising swaps each with a notional value of 50m.
Contracts with notional values of 530m are designated as cash flow hedges with fixed interest payments at an average rate of 1.51% for periods up until May 2011 and have floating interest receipts equal to 1 month LIBOR.
The non-amortising interest rate swap with a call option has a notional value of 50m with fixed interest payments at a rate of 4.595% for periods up until October 2013 and has floating interest payments equal to 6 month LIBOR.
At 31 December 2009 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate between one year and five years from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties, was estimated at 6.1m 2008: 25.8 m. This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps excluding those with a call option are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
A credit of 4.7m 2008: 8.7 m charge in respect of the fair value movement on interest rate swaps with a call option has been taken to the income statement through net finance charges as the Company has not applied hedge accounting.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts Average contract Notional principle fixed interest rate amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m 1 to 2 years 1.51% 4.95% 530.0 237.0 2.6 4.2 2 to 5 years - 5.02% - 200.0 - 13.5 530.0 437.0 2.6 17.7 The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 1 month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $400m unsecured senior notes described in note 24 i the Group and the Company have entered into five cross currency swaps in varying amounts between 23m and 63m to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of the unsecured loan notes, although there is a mutual break clause on each swap on 1 December 2010.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 231m as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The currency swaps manage the Groups and the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 26 January 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps each of 58m that convert the borrowing rate on $200m of debt from 5.77% to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a weighted average basis point increment of 81.9.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were both at 5.43%.
A further three interest rate swaps of 29m, 23m and 63m convert the borrowing rates on US$50m, US$40m and US$110m of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increments of 86.5, 86.7 and 86.05 respectively.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were at 5.47 weighted average %.
At 31 December 2009 the fair value of currency derivatives was estimated at 44.7m 2008: 80.3m.
All of these currency swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges.
Fair value hedges outstanding receive fixed pay floating contracts Average contract Notional principle fixed interest rate amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m 2 to 5 years 2.9% 6.6% 115.6 115.6 21.6 35.8 Greater than 5 years 2.9% 6.6% 115.6 115.6 23.1 44.5 231.2 231.2 44.7 80.3 The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 6 months LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 39.7m 2008: 108.2m, which was included in the income statement at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was included in the income statement.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$40m 2008: US$46m.
The fair value of these derivatives is 0m 2008: 2.4m.
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.
