IFRS as adopted for use by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB: however, the differences have no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements for the years presented.
Comparative gures in the income statement have been restated to include amounts previously reported as production and manufacturing expenses of $2,427 million for 2008 and $1,690 million for 2007, which we believe are more appropriately classi ed as production taxes.
There was no effect on the group pro t for the year or the group balance sheet.
