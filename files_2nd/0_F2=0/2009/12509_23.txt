Fixed asset investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their value.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.

The Company discounts its deferred tax liability as appropriate.
Cash and liquid resources Short-term cash deposits, which can be called on demand without any material penalty, are included within cash balances in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using an option-pricing model.

The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
