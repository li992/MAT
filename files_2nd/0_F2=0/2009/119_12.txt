A. L. Memmott ceased his accrual under the defined benefit plan on 1st March, 2008.
His accrued benefit retains a link to his final pensionable salary.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he retired at the year end.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The figures showing the transfer value of net increase in year include an allowance for the costs of providing death in service benefits.
The change in the amount of the transfer value during the year is made up of the following elements: a transfer value of the increase in accrued pension: b change in the transfer value of accrued pension at the start of the year due to ageing: and c the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liabilities in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, accordingly, have been excluded from the remuneration table.
