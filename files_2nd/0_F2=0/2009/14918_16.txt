The impact on the Groups financial statements of the future adoption of these standards and interpretations is still under review, but the Group does not expect any of these changes to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are fide-consolidated from the date when control ceases.
Disposals of minority interests result in gains and losses for the Group that are recorded in the income statement.
Purchases from minority interests are accounted for using the parent company method.
Goodwill is calculated as being the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary.
SThree plc 51 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that subsidiary operates its functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Groups presentation currency.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all of the Groups subsidiaries none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the Groups presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows: Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date: Income and expenses for each income statement are translated using the average rate of exchange unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions : and All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
The Group treats specific inter-company loan balances, which are not intended to be settled for the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment in the relevant subsidiaries.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Revenue and revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services provided in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is shown net of value added tax and other sales taxes, returns, rebates and discounts and after elimination of sales within the Group.
Contract revenue for the supply of professional services is recognised based on the number of hours worked by a contractor.
Revenue for permanent placements is recognised when candidates commence employment.
A provision is established for nonfulfilment of permanent placement obligations.
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Segment reporting The Group operates in one business segment being that of recruitment services primary segment.
The Group operates in two geographic segments secondary segment being the United Kingdom and Europe and the Rest of the World.
SThree plc 52 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Dividends Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements at the time they are paid.
The final dividends declared to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Companys and Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
The Company recognises dividends from subsidiaries at the time that they are received.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the depreciable value of property, plant and equipment to the income statement over their useful economic lives as follows: Computer equipment 33.33% per annum Leasehold improvement 20% per annum Fixtures and fittings 20% per annum Motor vehicles 33.33% per annum Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Assets under construction Purchased fixed assets or internally generated intangible assets that are still under development are classified as Assets under construction.
These assets are reclassified over the phased completion dates and are amortised from the date they are reclassified.
SThree plc 53 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Computer software The cost of acquired computer software licenses is capitalised.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives up to three years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense to the income statement when incurred.
Software and system development costs Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design or improvement of systems are recognised as intangible assets when the IAS 38 Intangible Assets recognition criteria are met.
Capitalised software and system development costs are amortised from the date the system is available for use over their expected useful lives not exceeding five years.
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense to the income statement as incurred.
Trademarks Trademarks are initially recognised at cost.
They have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks over their estimated useful lives up to twelve years.
Impairment of assets Assets that are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, by analysing individual assets or classes of assets that naturally belong together.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is measured based on the expected future discounted cash flows DCF model attributable to the asset.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in using DCF models to forecast operating cash flows, e. g. with respect to factors such as market growth rates, revenue volumes, market prices for services and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cash flows are based on best estimates of future revenues and operating expenses using historical trends, general market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Board of Directors.
The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate pre-tax discount rate derived from the Groups cost of capital.
Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on the Directors best knowledge of the amounts, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty made by the Directors in these financial statements are set out below.
i The determination of the carrying amount of capitalised software and systems development costs and assets under construction with the related amortisation, estimation of useful economic life and recoverability of such assets is deemed to be judgemental.
SThree plc 54 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued ii The Group follows the guidance of IAS 39 to determine when trade and other receivables are impaired.
This determination requires significant judgement.
In making this judgement, the Group evaluates, amongst other factors, the duration and extent to which the carrying values of a receivable is less than its cost, the risk profile of the client and other credit rating factors, the financial health, historical experience of and near-term business outlook for the client.
iii Revenue is recognised when the supply of professional services has been rendered, it also includes an assessment of professional services received by the client for the placement of temporary services between the date of the last received timesheet and the year end.
Unsubmitted timesheets are estimated to the extent that an open contract has not expired during the period under assessment.
Management apply judgement to several factors in estimating the revenue and cost of sales accruals: any difference compared to actual experience would result in the amount payable to the contractor and receivable from the client being adjusted in the next financial year.
The judgement applied, and the assumptions underlying these judgements are considered to be appropriate.
However, a change in these assumptions would impact upon both the amount of revenue and cost of sales recognised.
iv The Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of 5.5m 2008: 3.1m, of which 4.4m 2008: 1.3m related to trading losses that arose during the year that are to be carried forward and relieved against profits arising in future periods.
The judgement to recognise the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Groups expectations regarding future profitability based upon subsidiary revenue and cost forecasts for future years which contain a degree of inherent uncertainty.
Investments The Companys investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by the parent company, they are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Companys investment in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either held to maturity, available for sale financial assets or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Held to maturity financial assets Held-to-maturity financial assets comprises investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity for which there is a positive intention and ability to hold to maturity and which have not been designated at fair value through the income statement or as available for sale.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
SThree plc 55 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realisable value after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Group makes judgements on an entity by entity basis as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of significant outstanding invoices.
For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing percentages based on the age of the receivable.
In determining these percentages, the Group analyses its historical collection experience and current economic trends.
Trade receivable balances are written off when the Group determines that it is unlikely that future remittances will be received.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within current financial liabilities on the balance sheet unless they form part of a cash pooling arrangement in which case they are reported net of related cash balances.
Financial instruments The Group uses financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges of the risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Such financial instrument transactions are stated at their fair value.
Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising any resulting gain or loss depends on whether the financial instrument is designed as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Changes in the fair value of any financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial liabilities All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Net investment hedging Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Groups net investment in an overseas operation.
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Leases Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease periods.
SThree plc 56 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Short term financial liabilities and overdrafts Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Financial liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are recognised as the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
No provision is recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligation as a whole.
A provision may be recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Taxation Corporation tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profits for the period.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
SThree plc 57 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
Pension obligations the Group has defined contribution plans and pays contributions to privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on the Directors best estimate of the amounts due.
The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice of payments that has created a constructive obligation.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for those benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Employee Benefit Trusts The Employee Benefit Trusts EBT were funded by gifts from certain of the Companys shareholders and Directors.
The assets and liabilities of the EBT are consolidated into the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The EBTs main assets are the ordinary shares in the Group which were gifted and hence no cost is attributed to those shares and no amounts are shown in the Groups financial statements.
The EBT also holds shares which were subsequently newly issued in order to satisfy awards under the share option schemes and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The shares in the EBT are held for awards and grants under the employee share award, share option schemes and LTIP.
Share-based compensation The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which equity instruments are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
SThree plc 58 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid, up to the fair value of the award, at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Exceptional items Items which are of a non-recurring nature and material, when considering both size and nature, have been disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These items are shown as exceptional items on the face of the income statement.
Restructuring costs Provision is made for restructuring costs, including the costs of redundancy, when the Group has an actual or constructive obligation to pay amounts to third parties.
An obligation exists when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation of those affected by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features.
SThree plc 59 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 2 Segmental analysis As the Group operates in one business segment, being that of recruitment services, no additional business segment information is required to be provided.

SThree plc 62 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 3 Administrative expenses a Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items which, because of their size, incidence or nature, are separately disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying results for the period.
Items classified as exceptional are as follows: 29 November 30 November 2009 2008 000 000 Exceptional items charged to operating profit Corporate and divisional restructuring 9,050 Exchange loss on settlement of financial instruments 1,957 Exceptional items before taxation 9,050 1,957 Corporate and divisional restructuring On 15 April 2009, the Company announced a number of changes relating to corporate and divisional restructuring.
The total cost of this restructuring including redundancy, relocation and consolidation of business, is considered exceptional by virtue of its size.
The Group has charged the restructuring cost incurred in the current period to the income statement.
Exchange loss on settlement of financial instruments During the prior period, some complex financial instruments transactions were undertaken to mitigate certain foreign currency exposures.
These resulted in a 2.0m loss arising when a series of equal and opposite positions were taken during the previous financial year in order to reduce the Groups total exposure from these positions to a minimal level.
The Board has undertaken a review of its currency hedging strategy to ensure that it is appropriate and currently the Group does not actively manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk by the use of financial instruments.
The impact of foreign exchange will become a more significant issue for the Group as we expect the business mix to move further towards our international business.
The Group will continue to monitor its policies in this area.
As a result of earlier mitigation, the Group no longer has net exposure to complex derivative financial instruments, which the Board believes are not appropriate for the Group going forward.

SThree plc 68 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 8 Earnings per share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share EPS is based on the following data.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the EBT which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Impairment of goodwill Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of that cash-generating unit.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and an average annual growth rate of 2% over the next five years, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets.
A terminal value of the cash flow is then calculated by assuming growth of 2%, discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating-unit is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Software and system development cost In 2008, the Group began a phased rollout of a Customer Relationship Management CRM system to complement the front-office system.
Costs directly attributable to the development of the new systems were capitalised.
Additions during the year represent development of automated commission calculations system that will integrate to ERP payroll module.
Investments were also made to develop integration of web portals with candidate CV details.
This allows contractors to file online time sheets and also enables the development of a candidate client management system.
The Group has also developed and configured Human Resource, Payroll and Business Consolidation modules within the ERP system.
SThree plc 72 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 10 Intangible assets continued Recoverable amounts The recoverable amounts used for impairment testing of intangible fixed assets is based on value-in-use calculations using a pre-tax discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 10.1% 2008: 12.8%.
The future cash flow projections are based on approved financial budgets.
Average growth rates used to estimate cash flows for the first five years are in line with Board approved forecast, with the growth rate assumption thereafter limited to the expected growth rate of the local economy.

In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget and an average annual growth rate of 5% 2008: 2%, discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generatingunit is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to projected future net cash flows to arrive at the valuation was 10.1% 2008: 12.8%.
IFRS 2 requires that any options or awards granted to employees of a subsidiary company will increase the carrying value of the investment held.

Corporate and divisional restructuring On 15 April 2009, the Company announced a number of changes relating to corporate and divisional restructuring.
The Group has charged the restructuring cost incurred of 9.1m to the income statement in the current period.

This provision is expected to be utilised within 2 years.
Property Dilapidations The Group is obliged to pay for dilapidations at the end of its tenancy of various properties.
Provision has been made based on independent professional estimates of the likely costs based on current conditions and these have been spread over the relevant lease term.
The liability is expected to crystallise as follows: 29 November 30 November 2009 2008 000 000 Within one year 683 332 One to five years 782 713 After five years 139 243 1,604 1,288 SThree plc 80 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 17 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Other Other provisions principally include amounts in respect of liabilities resulting from indemnities given to Group clients in continental Europe arising in the normal course of business in respect of the employment status of contractors.

The main features of the LTIP are discussed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
d The weighted average fair value of the equity-settled share awards granted in 2007 amounted to 226.64p per award.
The fair value of the share awards was calculated using the Monte-Carlo simulation model.
The Monte-Carlo simulation model reflected the historical volatilities of the Companys share price and those other companies to which the Companys performance is compared, over a period equal to the vesting period.
The average share price on the date of grant was 402.0p, the vesting period in which performance of the TSR is assessed is 3 years.
e The weighted average fair value of the equity-settled share awards granted during the year amounted to 117.42p per award.

The SAYE was implemented in order to promote share ownership amongst all UK employees of the Company, linking employee benefit to the performance of the Company, and to aid retention of staff.
All UK employees and Executive Directors who have continuous service of more than six months, ending on the date of grant, or such shorter period as the Board may decide, with the Company, or any subsidiary in the Group nominated to join in the SAYE, are eligible to participate in the scheme.
The Board has discretion to reduce the period of qualifying service and to invite other employees of the Group to participate.
Under the SAYE, employees can save up to 250 per month for three or five years and receive options to purchase the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% on the market value.
During 2009, 233 employees 30% of those eligible applied to participate in the SAYE.
Options awarded under SAYE scheme are not subject to any performance conditions.
For the purpose of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, the Binomial option pricing model has been used for schemes with total shareholder return performance targets.
The assumptions used in the models are as follows: Weighted average fair value 61.24p Key assumptions used: Weighted average share price 198.00p Exercise prices 158.40p Range of expected volatility 40% Risk-free interest rate 4.75% Range of expected option term life 3 years Dividend yield 6.06% SThree plc 84 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 19 Share Capital continued b Share options continued Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP was approved by shareholders on 24 April 2009.
Under the SIP employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, wherever available, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
Best estimates have been used where historical data is not available in the respect.

SThree plc 91 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors Financial risk factors The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits.
The role of Corporate Treasury is to manage and monitor external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors, most recently on 27 November 2009.
Treasury management chaired by our Chief Financial Officer meets on a monthly basis to review treasury activities.
Its members receive management information relating to treasury activities.
Our internal auditors regularly review the Treasury internal control environment.
In previous years, the Group treasury entered into few derivative transactions, principally currency swaps and forward currency contracts with the purpose to manage the currency risks arising from operations and financing.
During 2008, a series of equal and opposite derivative positions were taken to reduce the Groups total exposure to derivatives to nil.
All above derivate transactions were closed during the year with minimal impact on income statement.
The Board undertook review of its currency hedging strategy to ensure it is appropriate and currently does not actively manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk by the use of financial instruments.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and our Treasury policies specifically prohibit such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and thus not engaged in speculative trading.
The Group has nil 2008: 46 derivative financial instruments open at the year end.
The Group is exposed to a number of different financial risks including foreign currency exchange rates, liquidity, interest rates, and credit risk.
The Groups objective and strategy in responding to these risks is set out below.
a Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
b Foreign currency exchange risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the Euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenues, cost of sales, the translation of the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from the value of net investments outside the United Kingdom.
The settlement of intercompany balances held with foreign operations is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Therefore, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investments are taken into equity.
The Groups businesses generally raise invoices and incur expenses in their local currencies.
Local currency cash generated is remitted via intercompany transfers to the United Kingdom.
The Group generally converts foreign currency balances into Sterling to manage its cash flows.
The anticipated impact on the Groups results if the Euro strengthened against Sterling by a movement of more than 10% in terms of transactional exposure amounts to an increase in profit before tax by 3.1m 2008: 3.1m.
If the Euro weakened against Sterling by more than 10% this would result in a decrease in profit before tax of 3.1m 2008 3.1m.
The effect to Equity would result in a movement of 3.3m.

The Group invests surplus cash in floating rate interest-earning deposit accounts with UK and European banks note 17.
The Groups treasury function centrally co-ordinates relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign exchange requirements and cash management.
The Group believes it has access to sufficient funding through an invoice financing arrangement that provides a committed borrowing facility of 20m.
The table below shows the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on the contractual amounts payable on the date of repayment: Trade and other payables Financial liabilities Group Company Group Company At 29 November 2009 000 000 000 000 Within one year 76,056 53,194 At 30 November 2008 Within one year 81,246 66,376 1,167 SThree plc 93 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued d Interest rate risk The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally financial liabilities.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit, the invoice discounting facility and, when required, bank overdrafts.
The Group does not hedge the exposure to variations in interest rates presented by the above instruments.
Based on the composition of the net debt as at 29 November 2009, and taking into consideration all variable rate borrowings and cash in place if the interest rate payable or receivable moved by a 100 basis points in either direction then the effect to the Group would be minimal.
Profit is more sensitive to interest rate decrease than increase because of borrowing with uncapped interest rates.
The sensitivity is lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of reduction in outstanding borrowings that has occurred as the entitys debt has matured.
e Credit Risk In the normal course of business, the Group participates in cash pooling arrangements with its counterparty bank.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 45.2m 2008: 24.4m.
Trade and other receivables of the Group are analysed in the table below.
With respect to the trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.
The Group mitigates its credit risk by using a credit rating agency to assess new clients and payment history to assess further credit extensions to existing clients.
In addition, the spread of SME client base circa 7,000 clients helps to mitigate the risk of individual client failure having a material impact on the Group.
The Group does not typically renegotiate the terms of trade receivables, hence the outstanding balance is included in the analysis based on the original payment terms.
There were no significant renegotiated balances outstanding at year end.

Important risk variables are stock exchange prices or indices.
As of 29 November 2009, the entity did not hold any material investments to be classified as available for sale or as held for trading.
Therefore there are no financial instruments which would be materially impacted by risk variables affecting the price of financial instruments.

These included foreign currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts with extension options and forward foreign exchange contracts with options based on foreign exchange rate movements.
Although these were not designated as hedges under the definitions as set out by IAS 39, they acted as economic hedges of the Groups foreign currency exposures and were accounted for at fair value through the income statement.
On 1st February 2008, the Group closed out these positions early, crystallising a 2.0m exceptional charge.
To close out these positions, exactly equal and opposite transactions were entered into, the last of which matured on 28 September 2009.
These resulted in a notional value of 24.6m.
SThree plc 97 5 SThree plc Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 29 November 2009 25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued i Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are equal to their fair values.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
A summary of the assumptions used for each category of financial instrument is set out below.
Summary of methods and assumptions Short-term deposits and borrowings Approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents Approximates to the carrying amount.
Receivables and payables Approximates to the carrying amount for current balances: there are no material longer term balances.
Financial instruments Market valuations at the balance sheet date.
