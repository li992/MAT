INVESTMENT PROPERTIES As at 31 December 2008, investment properties owned by the Group include office and commercial space and comprised only completed investment properties.
Investment properties under construction were carried at cost less impairment and presented within property, plant and equipment.
As a result of the adoption of the amendment to IAS 40, as at 1 January 2009 the Group has reclassified investment properties under construction Sunnyvale residences from property, plant and equipment to investment properties, at net book value of 10.3 million, which represents the net book value as at 31 December 2008.
Investment properties under construction are carried at cost less impairment if the fair value cannot be determined reliably until such time as the fair value becomes reliably determinable or completion is completed whichever is the earlier.
The Group has adopted this approach with Sunnyvale residences and has not taken any fair value adjustment.
