10 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per share for the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009 is based on the pro t after taxation of 85,440,116 2008: 47,178,969.
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a weighted average number of 345,895,311 2008: 342,198,365 shares in issue during the year.
The number of shares used in these calculations and the reconciliation of denominators used for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations is set out in the table below: Effect of Basic share options Diluted Year ended 31 January 2009 345,895,311 1,128,717 347,024,028 Year ended 31 January 2008 342,198,365 3,405,544 345,603,909 Additional disclosure has been provided in respect of earnings per share before non-recurring costs as the Directors believe this gives a better view of ongoing maintainable earnings in the prior year.

There are no anti-dilutive share options in the current or prior years.
The related depreciation charge for the year was 579,056 2008: 1,284,695.
The main finance leases are for EPOS equipment and motor vehicles.
The amount of interest capitalised during the year amounted to nil 2008: nil, bringing the total amount of capitalised interest to date to 741,500.
The related depreciation charge for the year was 31,500 2008: 31,500.
The goodwill is allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to cash-generating units as follows: 000 UK and Ireland 135,033 International 25,419 Total 160,452 The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The growth rates are based on industry forecasts, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash ows for no more than 13 years using a steady growth rate applicable to the relevant market.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The cash ows were discounted using pre-tax discount rates between 8 per cent and 13 per cent dependent on the territories concerned and GAMEs operations in those territories.
No impairments were recognised in the year.
To cause the carrying value of any of the Groups business units to exceed their recoverable amount would require material and signi cant adverse changes in one or a number of the assumptions made.
The Board do not consider these to be reasonably possible changes.
13 Inventories 2009 2008 000 000 Finished goods and goods held for resale 181,965 145,041 The Directors consider that the replacement value of inventories is not materially different from their carrying value.

GAME bears no risk of recovery and as a result, the risk of impairment of accounts receivable is not considered by the Directors to be signi cant.
As at 31 January 2009 and 31 January 2008 there were no amounts which were past due and no amounts which were impaired.

The Group holds a Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 70 million to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.
As at 31 January 2009 an amount of nil 2008: 15 million was drawn down for use in Spain.
The interest rate on the RCF is based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The oating rate sterling borrowings comprise a 55 million Term Loan taken out in order to fund the purchase of Gamestation and re finance the existing debt at GAME.
The interest rate on the loan is based on LIBOR.
The second repayment was made in January 2009 and two further instalments are due.
The terms of the loan facility includes a xed charge over the freehold property and a oating charge over assets.

In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example a change in interest rate and a change in foreign currency interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis prepared by management for foreign currency risk and interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 31 January 2009, if interest rates on the oating rate borrowings denominated in sterling had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, pro t after tax for the period would be 1,137,427 lower 2008: 1,037,910 lower.
At 31 January 2009, if interest rates on the oating rate borrowings denominated in euros had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, pro t after tax for the period would be 145,682 lower 2008: 173,231 lower.
The Directors consider that 100 basis points is the maximum likely change to sterling and euro interest rates over the next year, being the period up to the next point at which the Group expects to make these disclosures.
The tables in a and b above present financial liabilities and assets denominated in foreign currencies held by the Group in 2009 and 2008.
If the euro weakened or strengthened by 10 per cent against sterling, with all other variables held constant, pro t after tax and equity would reduce by 850,255 2008: reduce by 352,146. d Fair value of borrowings and financial assets Set out below is an analysis of all the Groups borrowings and financial assets by category.
The fair value of oating rate borrowings is the amortised cost because the interest rate payments are based on market value.

The Group expects increased competition from food retailers who are expanding their range of non-food items.
Seasonality The Groups business is highly seasonal with the key trading period being the Christmas season.
Turnover, operating pro t and cash ow may be adversely impacted by variations in demand during this period.
Technology Playing games online is a growing part of the market, whereby software content is sent digitally, direct from the publisher to the gamer.
This may lead to reduced product sales for mainline retailers.
