BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Supplementary information on oil and natural gas unaudited Net oil and gas wells completed or abandoned The following table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells completed or abandoned in the years indicated by the group and its equity-accounted entities.
Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.
Suspended development wells and long-term suspended exploratory wells are also included in the table.
