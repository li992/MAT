Included in borrowings due within one year are credit support obligations.
When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank counterparties, Diageo may, where appropriate, enter into certain agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefi t of the other if the net valuations of the derivatives are above a pre-determined threshold.
At 30 June 2009, the collateral received under these agreements amounted to $84 million 51 million 2008 $nil, nil.
The interest rates shown in the table above are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any interest rate protection see note 22.

For this calculation, the interest charge excludes fi finance charges unrelated to net borrowings, the forward element on derivative fi financial instruments and fair value adjustments to borrowings.
