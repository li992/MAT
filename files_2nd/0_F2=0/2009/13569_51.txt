7 The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme the Scheme.
The purpose of the Scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes by the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the Scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
Andrew Shilston is a member of this Scheme.
He joined the Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary.
Employer contributions to the Scheme during 2009 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2009 for the registered defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the first table.
8 Colin Smith receives a cash allowance in lieu of future pension accrual.
Mike Terrett also received a cash allowance until he started to receive his pension from November 1, 2009.
Had they elected to continue to accrue pension the estimated cost of that accrual would be higher than the cash allowance to be paid in lieu.
9 Mike Terrett started to receive his pension from November 1, 2009.
The total accrued pension entitlement at December 31, 2009 is after allowance for early payment of pension and taking a part of his pension as lump sum.
The transfer value is the value of benefits in payment as at December 31, 2009 increased by cash taken on retirement.
10 The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year.
11 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
12 Benefits are translated at 1 US$1.615.
13 James Guyette is a member of two defined benefit plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified.
He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans.
The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these two plans, and the transfer values of these benefits, are shown in the second table.
In addition, James Guyette is a member of two 401 K Savings Plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc. contribute.

Employer contributions to these three plans during 2009 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2009 for the defined benefit plans and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the second table.
