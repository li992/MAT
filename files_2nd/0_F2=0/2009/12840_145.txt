Contingent liabilities balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
The Company is party to cross guarantee arrangements relating to an overdraft facility for certain group companies accounts at Barclays Bank Plc.
The maximum exposure at 31 May 2009 was 10.0 million 2008: 10.0 million.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings and current asset investments approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The financial instruments held by the Company do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash flow interest rate risk.
An interest rate swap contract was entered into to hedge the cash flow interest rate risk inherent in liabilities with a notional value of 30.0 million.
This swap ensures an average effective fixed rate payable of 5.11% until June 2011.
At 31 May 2009, the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of 1.8 million 2008: nil.
