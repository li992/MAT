A list of these items is included in note 2 a of the Group financial statements.
e Currency translation The functional currency of the Company is the US dollar and is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are initially recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
f Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
The investment is reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
g Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
Investments in associates are accounted at acquisition cost.
h Dividends The dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.
i Other receivables Current receivables are carried at the original amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost.
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three months or less and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
k Share capital Ordinary Shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue.
The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
138 Accounts 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Share based payments The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between accounting dates are recognised as an expense.
The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each accounting date to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
m Finance income and costs Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments.
Interest income and costs are recognised as they accrue, taking into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, respectively.
n Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes: Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
o Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it.
The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: 139 A Accou ccoun nt ts s Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Accounts Notes to the parent company financial statements continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss includes financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit and loss.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract which is not measured at fair value through profit or loss when the analysis shows that the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contract.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments or a financial guarantee contract.
Gains or losses on financial assets held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified as loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Fair values The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
These include using recent arms length market transactions: reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same: discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models.
Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, through the use of an allowance account.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
140 Accounts 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Assets carried at cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, or on a derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Available-for-sale financial assets If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Derecognition of financial instruments A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised when: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either: a the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset: or b the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, a new asset is recognised to the extent of the Companys continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset, is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.
A financial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
p Dividends distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
q Convertible bond The relevant standards within the accounting framework governing the treatment of this transaction are: a IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and b IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The convertible bond is a compound financial instrument that includes a financial liability and an equity instrument.
At initial recognition the Company determines the fair value of the liability component, and the equity component as a residual amount that is never remeasured after initial recognition.
Derecognition of the convertible bond issued by the Company will be done when the debt is cancelled.

17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have an impact on the achievement of financial and economic objectives.
These risks include strategic, operational and financial risk and are further categorised into risk areas to facilitate risk assessment.
a Foreign currency risk A proportion of the Companys costs are incurred in pounds sterling and Canadian dollars.
Accordingly, the Companys financial results may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar, pounds sterling and Canadian dollars.
The Company does not use derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risks.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax and the Companys equity.
Increase decrease in Effect US$ other on profit Effect currencies before tax on equity Year rate US$000 US$000 2009 Pounds sterling 10% 174 2008 Pounds sterling 10% 433 150 Accounts 17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED b Credit risk Credit risk arises from debtors inability to meet their payment obligations to the Company as they become due without taking into account the fair value of any guarantee or pledged assets.
The Company is primarily exposed to credit risk in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable at the balance sheet date.
As a result of the recent and ongoing financial crisis, the Company has evaluated and introduced additional efforts to try to mitigate credit risk exposure.
To manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Company is using implementing the following options: Increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk.
Investing cash to the extent possible with counterparties with whom the Group has debt outstanding.
Investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments money market accounts.
Maintaining excess cash abroad in hard currency.
Credit risk concentrations exist when changes in economic, industrial or geographic factors take place, affecting in the same manner the Companys counterparties whose added risk exposure is significant to the Companys total credit exposure.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in notes 8 and 9. c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Companys inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value.
Management constantly monitors the Companys level of shortand medium-term liquidity and their access to credit lines on reasonable terms in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations.
The table below analyses the Companys financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date: Between Between Less than 1 and 2 2 and 5 Over 1 year years years 5 years Total US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 At 31 December 2009 Trade and other payables refer to note 11 7,183 7,183 Borrowings 7,118 35,957 208,214 251,289 At 31 December 2008 Trade and other payables refer to note 11 2,313 2,313 Borrowings 4,260 71,000 151,523 226,783 d Interest rate risk The Company has financial assets which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily loans and borrowings by changing either their fair value fixed rate debt or their future cash flows variable rate debt.
The Company does not have a formal policy of determining how much of its exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Company over the expected period until maturity.
It is important to note that currently all existing financial obligations are either at fixed rates or have been fixed with the use of derivatives.

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Company that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the financial instruments with a floating rate.
This assumes that the amount remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2009 and 2008 and that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year.
In reality, the floating rate will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will change accordingly: Increase Effect on decrease in profit before Year interest rate tax US$000 2009 50bps 530 2008 50bps 570 e Capital risk management The Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Management considers as part of its capital, the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third parties.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company, management monitors capital thoroughly and evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.
