Eight of these CGUs are within the banking division: four are within the asset management division and the remaining two are within the securities division.
Details of the CGUs in which the goodwill carrying amount is significant in comparison with total goodwill are disclosed separately in the table below where applicable: Net book value of goodwill Foreign 31 July 2008 Additions exchange Impairment Disposals 31 July 2009 million million million million million million Winterflood Securities 23.3 23.3 Close Private Bank 17.4 17.4 Close Brothers Cayman 13.3 2.6 15.9 Close Asset Management 17.6 10.4 7.2 Corporate Finance 11.2 22.4 33.6 OLIM 10.5 6.6 3.9 Close Asset Finance 5.9 1.4 0.1 7.4 Other 27.6 0.3 0.3 2.0 1.3 24.9 126.8 24.1 3.0 19.0 34.9 100.0 Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at least annually using value in use calculations.
This calculation uses discounted cash flows, based on the most recent budgets and three year plans, to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
For cash flows beyond the groups three-year planning horizon, a terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity growth model with a conservative annual growth rate of 2.5% for each CGU, except where circumstances warrant a different rate.
The resulting cash flow projections were then discounted assuming a starting rate of 9.3%, which takes into account the weighted average cost of capital and the rates an investor would require to invest in the asset.
This starting point is then increased as applicable to take into account the statutory corporate tax rate in effect in the country in which each CGU primarily operates.
This is appropriate due to the use of pre-tax operating cash flows in the model.
The 19.0 million of impairments detailed in the table above were all written off against goodwill at 31 January 2009.
It was determined at that time that a review for impairment was warranted due to the significant deterioration in the economic conditions which affected the markets these CGUs operate in, and the resultant reductions in expected revenues and profits.
At the reporting date, management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
