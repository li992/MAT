2 Segmental analysis Business segments The Group operates one class of business: rental of equipment.
Operationally, the Group is split into two business units, Sunbelt and A-Plant which separately report to, and are managed by, the chief executive and align with the geographies in which they operate, being the US and UK, respectively.
The Group also owned Ashtead Technology, which was sold during the year and therefore has been classi ed as a disposal group refer note 7.
These business units are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
The Group manages debt and taxation centrally, rather than by business unit.
Accordingly, segmental results are stated before interest and taxation which are reported as central Group items.
This is consistent with the way the chief executive reviews the business.
Segment assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, acquired intangibles, inventory and receivables.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude taxation balances, corporate borrowings and accrued interest.
Capital expenditure represents additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and includes additions through the acquisition of businesses.
Segmental analysis by geography The Groups operations are located in North America and the United Kingdom.
Until the disposal of Ashtead Technology, the Group also operated in Singapore.
The following table provides an analysis of the Groups revenue, segment assets and capital expenditure, including acquisitions, by country of domicile.

a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 25.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk pro les of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 30-60 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a signi cant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
In the US the allowance account for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience re ecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, this cannot be attributed to speci c receivables so the aged analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is shown gross of the allowance for bad and doubtful receivables.
On this basis, the ageing analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is as follows: Trade receivables past due by: Less than 30 60 60 90 More than Current 30 days days days 90 days Total m m m m m m Carrying value at 30 April 2009 27.8 55.7 28.4 8.1 21.6 141.6 Carrying value at 30 April 2008 27.8 69.4 28.2 8.1 16.2 149.7 In practice, Sunbelt operates on 30 day terms and considers receivables past due if they are unpaid after 30 days.

These financial plans were updated during the 2009 10 budgeting cycle and re ect the current economic environment.
The growth rate assumptions used in the plans were based on past performance and managements expectations of market developments.
The annual growth rate used to determine the cash ows beyond the three year period is 2% and does not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash ows is 9%.
A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by changing the key assumptions used for both Sunbelt and A-Plant.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the assumptions resulted in the carrying value of the goodwill in Sunbelt or A-Plant being reduced to the recoverable amount.

First priority senior secured credit facility The $1.75bn first priority asset-based senior secured loan facility ABL facility consists of a $1.5bn revolving credit facility and a $250m term loan and is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolver loan is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 225bp to LIBOR plus 150bp.
At 30 April 2009 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 175bp.
The term loan is priced at LIBOR plus 175bp.
The ABL facility carries minimal amortisation of 1% per annum $2.5m on the term loan and is committed until August 2011.
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are tested only if available liquidity is less than $125m.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2009 was 371m $550m re ecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 21m $32m.
As the ABL facility is asset-based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.
The maximum amount which could be drawn at 30 April 2009 was 899m $1,332m.
8.625% second priority senior secured notes due 2015 having a nominal value of $250m On 3 August 2005 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead Holdings plc, issued $250m of 8.625% second priority senior secured notes due 1 August 2015.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2008: 15.5m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The ESOT has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not signi cant.
The Group has recognised the fair value of share-based payments to employees based on grants of shares since 7 November 2002 the transitional date for IFRS 2, Share-based payments.
Cash Incentive Plan The Cash Incentive Plan CIP is an award of units which are subject to the same performance conditions as apply to the Companys unapproved share option scheme.
Awards were granted under this plan in 2000 and 2001 and are exercisable up to February 2010 and 2011, respectively, as all performance conditions have been satis ed.
On exercise by the option holder, the difference between the mid-market price of Ashtead Group plc shares on that day and the grant prices of 94.09p and 115.31p, for the 2000 and 2001 awards respectively, multiplied by the number of units held will be paid by way of a cash award to the holder, net of applicable taxes.
In 2009 the charge in respect of the CIP was nil 2008: 179,000 credit.
The fair value of the awards at 30 April 2009 was based on the share price on that date.
Performance Share Plan Details of the Performance Share Plan PSP are given on pages 41 and 42.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2009, there was a net credit in respect of the PSP of 907,000 2008: charge of 2,070,000.
This re ected the Companys assessment that it was unlikely that the 2006 or 2007 PSP awards would vest due to the economic downturn.
The performance criteria related to these awards were non-market performance measures and the amounts charged in prior years in relation to these awards have therefore been reversed.
The fair value of awards granted during the year is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 56.5p, nil exercise price, a dividend yield of 4.42% volatility of 39.85%, a risk free rate of 4.16% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.
Discretionary share option schemes Details of the discretionary share option schemes are given on page 41.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the Group has not recognised any expense for these schemes as they were all granted prior to 7 November 2002.

The Group reports in sterling and pays dividends in sterling.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas, the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as fide ned in IFRS 7.
Interest rate risk Management of xed and variable rate debt The Group has xed and variable rate debt in issue with 52% of the drawn debt at a xed rate.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result the carrying value of xed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds plus 175bp for revolver borrowings and term borrowings.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2009, the Group had no such outstanding swap agreements.
The Group also may at times hold cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2009, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax pro ts would change by approximately 5m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and, after tax effects, equity would change by approximately 3m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may uctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the revolving tranches of the senior secured credit facility.
Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, a majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs is denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its nancing such that approximately 99% of its debt is also denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenues in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas pro ts into sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on signi cant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2009, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound exchange rate would have impacted our pre-tax pro ts by approximately 0.3m and equity by approximately 2.4m.
At 30 April 2009, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial risk management continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table.
2009 2008 m m Cash and cash equivalents 1.7 1.8 Trade and other receivables 148.3 159.9 150.0 161.7 The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving over 680,000 during the financial year, and does not have any signi cant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit reference agencies and the maintenance of credit control functions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience dif culties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates signi cant free cash ow fide ned as cash ow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash ow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash ow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2009, availability under this facility was $550m 371m.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity pro le for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
In order to manage the short and long-term capital structure, the Group adjusts the amount of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, returns capital to shareholders for example, share buy-backs and arranges appropriate nancing to fund business investment and mergers and acquisitions.
The Group seeks to maintain leverage of between 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA over the economic cycle.
Fair value of financial instruments Net fair values of derivative financial instruments At 30 April 2009, the Groups embedded prepayment options included within its secured loan notes had a combined fair value of nil 2008: nil.
At 30 April 2009, the Group had no other derivative financial instruments.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The table below provides a comparison, by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at 30 April 2009.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

28 Contingent liabilities Sunbelt Rentals is subject to a class action lawsuit in Florida alleging, inter alia, that NationsRent prior to its acquisition by Sunbelt in 2006 improperly charged its customers an environmental fee.
In February 2009 the court certi ed a class of all persons charged an environmental fee by NationsRent in the period between June 2003 and August 2006.
The plaintiffs are asking that the environmental fee be returned to class members an estimated $20m, plus interest and legal costs.
The plaintiffs claim is based on the theory that because NationsRent did not place the environmental fee revenue into an escrow account, it spent no money on environmental related expenses and the fee was pure pro t. Sunbelts legal advisers believe that the merits of the lawsuit are weak because there is no legal obligation to place the environmental fee into a segregated account.
Moreover, NationsRent never indicated to its customers the environmental fee was hypothecated to any particular expenditure and, regardless, NationsRent incurred substantial environmental related costs.
On 28 May 2009, a similar case was led in the North Carolina Court against Sunbelt by a plaintiff represented by the same plaintiff attorneys acting in the Florida case.
The Group is also subject to periodic legal claims and tax audits in the ordinary course of its business, none of which, including the NationsRent environmental matter, is expected to have a signi cant impact on the Groups financial position.
The Company has guaranteed the borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings under the Groups senior secured credit and overdraft facilities.
At 30 April 2009 the amount borrowed under these facilities was 505.7m 2008: 561.1m.
Additionally, subsidiary undertakings are able to obtain letters of credit under these facilities which are also guaranteed by the Company and, at 30 April 2009, letters of credit issued under these arrangements totalled 21.3m $31.6m.
Additionally the Company has guaranteed the 8.625% second priority senior secured notes with a par value of $250m 169m and 9% second priority senior secured notes with a par value of $550m 371m, issued by Ashtead Holdings plc and Ashtead Capital, Inc. respectively.
The Company has guaranteed operating and finance lease commitments of subsidiary undertakings where the minimum lease commitment at 30 April 2009 totalled 76.6m 2008: 66.6m in respect of land and buildings and 5.2m 2008: 8.2m in respect of other lease rentals of which 7.1m and 3.4m respectively is payable by subsidiary undertakings in the year ending 30 April 2010.
The Company has guaranteed the performance by subsidiaries of certain other obligations up to 1.0m 2008: 1.4m.
29 Capital commitments At 30 April 2009 capital commitments in respect of purchases of rental and other equipment totalled 11.3m 2008: 108.1m, all of which had been ordered.
There were no other material capital commitments at the year end.
30 Related party transactions The Groups key management comprise the Companys executive and non-executive directors.
Details of their remuneration together with their share interests and share option awards are given in the Directors Remuneration Report and form part of these financial statements.
During the period until his employment terminated on 6 April 2009, Sunbelt reimbursed Cliff Miller accommodation costs of 13,580 2008: 10,460.
This related to an apartment leased on an arms length basis from CE Property Management, a partnership in which Cliff Miller is a partner.
31 Employees The average number of employees, including directors, during the year was as follows: 2009 2008 North America 6,742 7,324 United Kingdom 2,318 2,462 Rest of World 12 9,060 9,798 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 New accounting standards The Group has not adopted early the following pronouncements, which have been issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, but have not yet been endorsed for use in the EU with the exception of IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in foreign operation.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements was issued in September 2007 and will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The revised standard introduces the concept of a statement of comprehensive income, which enables users of the financial statements to analyse changes in a companys equity resulting from transactions with owners separately from non-owner changes.
The revised standard provides the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other comprehensive income either as a single statement of comprehensive income or in two separate statements.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this revised standard will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in foreign operation was issued on 3 July 2008 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
This interpretation clari es that in respect of net investment hedges that relate to differences in functional currency and not presentation currency, hedging instruments may be held anywhere in the group and that the requirements of IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates do apply to the hedged items.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations was issued on 10 January 2008 and will apply to business combinations occurring on or after 1 April 2010.
The revised standard introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that a business acquisition occurs and future reported results.
Assets and liabilities arising from business combinations before 1 April 2010 will not be restated and thus there will be no effect on the Groups results or financial position on adoption.
However, this standard is likely to have a signi cant impact on the accounting for business acquisitions post adoption.
Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements was issued on 10 January 2008 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The amendment requires that when a transaction occurs with non-controlling interests in Group entities that does not result in a change in control, the difference between the consideration paid or received and the recorded non-controlling interest should be recognised in equity.
In cases where control is lost, any retained interest should be remeasured to fair value with the difference between fair value and the previous carrying value being recognised immediately in the income statement.
Transactions occurring before 1 April 2010 will not be restated and thus there will be no effect on the Groups results or financial position on adoption.
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate was issued on 3 July 2008 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This interpretation clari es whether a real estate sale agreement is within the scope of IAS 18 Revenue or IAS 11 Construction contracts.
In accordance with IAS 18, revenue is recognised when property is transferred to the customer, but under IAS 11, revenue is recognised over the period of construction.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement: eligible hedged items was issued on 31 July 2008 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and must be applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies.
The amendment prohibits designating in ation as a hedgeable component of xed rate debt and also prohibits including time value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges.
IFRIC 17 Distributions of non-cash assets to owners was issued on 27 November 2008 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This interpretation clari es how an entity should measure distributions of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners.
IFRS 1 Revised First time adoption of IFRS was issued on 27 November 2008 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The revised standard does not contain any technical changes but there is an improvement to its structure, which had become complex due to the numerous amendments in recent years.
As the Group has already adopted IFRS, there will be no effect on the Groups results or financial position on adoption.
Amendment to IAS 39 Reclassi cation of financial assets: effective date and transition was issued on 27 November 2008 and is effective on adoption of original amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement refer to page 54 under Note 1: Accounting policies.
The original amendment that has now been reworded to clarify the effective date and transition requirements of adoption will have no effect on the Groups results or financial position on adoption.
IFRIC 18 Transfer of assets from customers was issued on 29 January 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The interpretation addresses the diversity in practice that arises when entities account for assets received from a customer in return for connection to a network or ongoing access to goods or services.
Amendment to IFRS 7 Improving disclosures about financial instruments was issued on 5 March 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendment increases disclosure requirements by introducing a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosures and requires some speci c quantitative disclosures for financial instruments where fair value is not determined using observable market data.
The amendment also requires enhanced liquidity risk disclosure, including a separate maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities and financial assets.
The Group currently determines the fair value of its financial instruments using observable market data and therefore believes that the adoption of this amendment will have a limited impact on the disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.
81 Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 Embedded derivatives were issued on 12 March 2009 and are effective for annual periods ending on or after 30 June 2009.
The amendment applies to entities that reclassi ed financial assets out of the at fair value through pro t and loss category under the original amendment to IAS 39 refer to page 54 under Note 1: Accounting policies and clari es that on reclassi cation of these financial assets all embedded derivatives should be reassessed and if necessary, accounted for separately.
Improvement to IFRSs 2009 was issued in April 2009 and its requirements are effective over a range of dates, with the earliest effective date being for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This comprises a number of amendments to IFRSs, which resulted from the IASBs annual improvements project.
The Group does not believe the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
