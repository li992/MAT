Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2009 1.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables, the net realisable value of inventory, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, the reserves in respect of self-insured insurance, the consideration received from vendors, onerous lease provisions, taxation and the cost and liability for pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
Allowance for doubtful accounts Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired.
Within each of the businesses assessment is made locally of the recoverability of accounts receivable based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable and the creditworthiness of the customer.
The provision is assessed monthly with a detailed formal review of balances and security being conducted at the full year and half year.
Determining the recoverability of an account involves estimation as to the likely financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently make payment.
If the Group is cautious as to the financial condition of the customer the Group may provide for accounts that are subsequently recovered.
Similarly if the Group is optimistic as to the financial condition of the customer the Group may not provide for an account that is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable.
Furthermore, while the Group has a large geographically dispersed customer base, a slowdown in the markets in which the Group operates may result in higher than expected uncollectible amounts and therefore higher or lower than anticipated charges for irrecoverable receivables.
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2009 in respect of doubtful accounts represented 0.9 per cent of revenue 2008: 0.5 per cent.
Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2009 amounting to 81 million 2008: 79 million.
Inventories For financial reporting purposes the Group evaluates its inventory to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged inventories.
Damaged inventories are identified and written down through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each business.
Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories is assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial reporting.
Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales.
Future sales are assessed based on historical experience, and adjusted where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue to manufacture the particular item.
To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary significantly.
For example, changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and requiring such inventory to be fully written off.
The Group held allowances in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2009 amounting to 151 million 2008: 160 million.
Impairment of long-lived assets Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible fixed assets, relying on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans and projected future cash flows.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.
Estimates are used in deriving these cash flows and the discount rate.
As disclosed in notes 14, 15 and 16, the Group has charged 879 million in respect of the impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended 31 July 2009 2008: 186 million.
The results of these tests for impairment are sensitive to the assumptions made in the value in use calculations.
The Group has estimated the effect of increasing the discount rate by one percentage point, and of decreasing the trading margin for each asset group by one percentage point in the final year of the cash flow forecast.
The additional impairment charge that would arise under either of these alternative assumptions is less than 5 per cent of the carrying amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets of 2,057 million at 31 July 2009.
Self-insured insurance The Group operates a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited, which is registered and operational in the Isle of Man.
This company provides reinsurance exclusively to certain companies within the Group, principally to cover US casualty and global property damage risks.
Provision is made based on actuarial assessment of the liabilities arising from the insurance coverage provided.
The actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims necessarily includes estimates as to the likely trend of future claims costs and the estimates as to the emergence of further claims subsequent to the year end.
An actuarial review of claims is performed annually.
To the extent that actual claims differ from those projected the provisions could vary significantly.
At 31 July 2009, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was 57 million 2008: 51 million.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Consideration received from vendors The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates primarily upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels with many of these agreements applying to sales in a calendar year.
For certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made.
The Group accrues the receipt of vendor rebates as part of its cost of sales for products sold, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through to the end of the qualifying period.
Rebates are accrued for each reporting period with an extensive reassessment of the rebates earned being performed at the end of the financial year and half way through the financial year.
The Group has agreements with numerous and geographically dispersed suppliers, but a slow down in the markets in which the Group operates, or a significant change in the profile of products purchased may result in purchases for the remainder of the year differing significantly from those projected.
Consequently the rebate actually received may vary from that accrued in the financial statements.
Onerous lease provisions When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount of the assets, and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract.
Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.
To the extent that actual cash flows received differ from those estimated, the amount of provision recognised could differ materially.
During the year ended 31 July 2009 the number of vacant properties has increased significantly due to branch closures.
At 31 July 2009, the provision for onerous leases was 124 million.
Impairment of construction loan receivables and foreclosed properties held for sale A provision for impairment of construction loan receivables is made when management estimates that the present value of future cash flows recoverable in respect of these receivables is less than the carrying amount.
Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating the amount and timing of such future cash flows, which requires an assessment of the financial condition of the debtor: the ability of the debtor to meet contractual payments: and in the event that the Group forecloses on the property on which the receivable is secured, the likely cost of enhancing the marketability of the property, the likely disposal proceeds, and the likely period for which the property will be held to maximise such proceeds.
To the extent that actual amounts recovered differ from those estimated, the amount of provision recognised could differ materially.
At 31 July 2009, the provision for impairment of construction loans receivables was 39 million 2008: 18 million and the provision against foreclosed properties held for sale was 18 million 2008: 4 million.
Taxation Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and exposures.
Amounts accrued are based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of the potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
All such provisions are included in creditors due within one year.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 32.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and life expectancy.
The Group has estimated the sensitivity of the financial statements to changes in these assumptions as follows: Increase decrease in liability 2009 Effect of a change in discount rate m Increase of 0.5% 92 Decrease of 0.5% 104 Effect of an increase in life expectancy Increase of one year 34 Wolseley plc 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2009 2.
Segmental analysis Wolseleys reportable segments, which are those reported to the Board, are the operating businesses overseen by distinct continental and divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution and supply of construction materials and services.
In 2009 management responsibility for heavy-side businesses in Eastern Europe was transferred from Central and Eastern Europe to the Nordic management team.
These businesses are therefore now included in the Nordic segment results.
The comparative figures for 2008 have been restated to reflect the transfer of 93 million of revenue and 3 million of operating loss from Central and Eastern Europe to Nordic.
The effect on trading profit is not material.
The amounts reported in 2008 for the US building materials segment have also been restated.
The part of the business sold is presented as discontinued operations and the construction loan business retained is shown as North America loan services.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal but revenue and trading profit are normally slightly higher in the second half.
The Groups customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer.
The revenue, trading profit and operating loss profit of the Groups reportable segments are detailed in the following three tables.

Loss earnings per share Basic loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations of 558.0 pence 2008: earnings per share of 41.0 pence is calculated on the loss for the year attributable to shareholders of 1,173 million 2008: profit of 74 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Basic loss per share from continuing operations of 348.2 pence 2008: earnings per share of 134.0 pence is calculated on the loss after tax from continuing operations of 732 million 2008: profit of 242 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, of 210 million 2008: restated number of 181 million.
As detailed in note 12 below, the Group believes that profit measures before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements.
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table: 2008 Continuing operations 2009 restated Before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 95.6p 240.3p Add back: exceptional items net of tax 170.3 p 24.9 p Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles net of deferred tax 273.5 p 81.4 p Basic loss earnings per share 348.2 p 134.0p The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 211 million 2008: restated number of 181 million.
The diluted loss per share from continuing operations is also 348.2 pence 2008: earnings per share of 133.8 pence.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 95.5 pence 2008: 239.9 pence.

Exceptional items are material non-recurring items which are excluded from trading profit to enable a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying financial performance.
In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 where no amortisation or impairment of acquired intangibles was recognised, businesses that have developed organically where no intangibles are attributed and those businesses more recently acquired where amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance indicators, calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

Intangible assets goodwill continued All goodwill has arisen from business combinations.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to cash-generating units CGUs.
These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market ranging from 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and discounted back to present value.
The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital, based on the five year historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates, adjusted for the risk attributable to individual CGUs.
The pre-tax discount rate ranges from 11 per cent to 14 per cent.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2009.
These impairment reviews have resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of 490 million in respect of continuing operations and 288 million in respect of discontinued operations relating to goodwill and acquired intangible assets held by the following businesses: DT Group Nordic DT Group has experienced a significant downturn in its markets and is forecasting this to continue over the short and medium terms, with a gradual recovery to levels of activity below those it experienced in recent years.
As a result of reflecting these reduced expectations in its value in use calculations, the Group has recognised a goodwill impairment charge of 359 million in respect of the Stark, Silvan and Starkki divisions of DT Group.
UK Wolseley UK has experienced a significant deterioration in its markets in the year and is forecasting this to continue over the short and medium term.
As a result of reflecting these reduced expectations in its value-in-use calculations, the Group has recognised a goodwill impairment charge of 109 million in respect of the Electric Center, Build Center, Brandon Hire and Encon divisions of UK and Ireland.
Benelux Central and Eastern Europe The Groups business in Benelux has performed below expectations at the time of the acquisition of the Centratec business in Belgium, and the Group has reappraised the likely levels of revenue and margin that can be achieved in the long term.
An impairment loss of 22 million goodwill 21 million and other intangible assets 1 million has been calculated on a value-in-use basis.
Stock discontinued operations Prior to its disposal, the Group announced its intention to exit the US Building Materials sector and performed an impairment review at that time.
Accordingly, the Group regarded Stock as a single CGU and considered it appropriate to write off all the remaining goodwill and intangible assets of the business, resulting in an impairment charge of 288 million goodwill 180 million and other intangible assets 108 million.

Other intangible assets arise on business combinations.
Included in the amounts above are 134 million 2008: 132 million relating to assets under construction.
The Group continues to restrict capital expenditure on its Business Change Programme and as a consequence, certain software assets under development with a book value of 41 million will not be implemented and used as was originally intended and have therefore been impaired.
In addition a further 2 million of software assets have been impaired as a result of restructuring actions.
More details on the impairment charge for the year in respect of trade names and brands and customer relationships is provided in note 14.

There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 96 million 2008: 93 million that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in Italy of 13 million and the Czech Republic of 14 million expire after five years.
The remaining tax losses of 69 million can be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 567 million 2008: 679 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption and therefore no tax liability is expected to arise.

Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
Trade receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established with customers as follows: 2009 2008 m m Amounts not yet due 876 1,269 Past due not more than one month 530 763 Past due more than one month and less than three months 211 316 Past due more than three months and less than six months 25 40 Past due more than six months 14 34 Amounts individually determined to be impaired 66 57 1,722 2,479 Other receivables include an amount of 42 million 2008: 36 million which has been discounted at a rate of 4.3 per cent 2008: 4.6 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.

Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Groups bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.
Interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on notional principal of 900 million 2008: $300 million and 1,000 million and basis point swaps with notional principal of 900 million 2008: $300 million and 400 million are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.
The contracts expire between August 2009 and August 2011 2008: September 2008 and August 2011, and the fixed interest rates range between 2.59 per cent and 4.59 per cent 2008: 2.49 per cent and 5.42 per cent.

Interest rate swaps contracts comprising fixed interest receivable on notional principal of $729 million 2008: $729 million are designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings.
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge, and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings see note 6.
The contracts expire between November 2012 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent 2008: 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent.

These loans are generally settled when completed homes are sold, rather than at a fixed term.
The average age since origination is 20 months 2008: 14 months.
As the contractual maturity of these loans, which did not exceed 12 months from the reporting date, was set at origination to correspond to the normal operating cycle of the construction business, and the Group expects to realise the loans within their contractual maturity, these loans have all been classified as current assets.
As at 31 July 2009, the effective rate of interest thereon was 8 per cent 2008: 9 per cent.
The fair value of construction loan receivables and borrowings to finance construction loans approximates to book value.

Construction loans continued Construction loan receivables on which payments are delinquent are subject to foreclosure of the property on which the loan is secured, such that the disposal proceeds of the property can be applied in settlement of the outstanding liability.
After foreclosure, the balance of receivables net of provisions for impairment is transferred to assets held for sale.
Provisions for impairments of receivables comprise: a provision for amounts that have been individually determined not to be collectable in full, because of known financial difficulties of the debtor or evidence of default or delinquency in payment, amounting to 13 million at 31 July 2009 2008: 6 million : and a provision based on historic experience of the shortfall of disposal proceeds of foreclosed properties to the outstanding balance due, amounting to 26 million at 31 July 2009 2008: 12 million.
Management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
In addition to the exceptional charge of 25 million for impairment of construction loan receivables shown above, an exceptional charge of 6 million was made to write down assets held for sale to their recoverable amount.
Construction loan receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established with customers as follows: 2009 2008 m m Amounts not yet due 107 186 Past due not more than one month 20 22 Past due more than one month and less than three months 10 12 Past due more than three months and less than six months 10 6 Past due more than six months 42 23 Amounts individually determined to be impaired 13 6 202 255 Construction loan receivables at 31 July 2009 includes 54 million in respect of loans on which foreclosure proceedings have been started 2008: 24 million.
The fair value of collateral held in respect of construction loans receivable is sufficient to cover the net amount of construction loans receivable.
During the year ended 31 July 2009 disposal proceeds of 36 million 2008: 10 million were realised from the sale of foreclosed properties, in respect of loans with a carrying value of 46 million 2008: 12 million.

The average maturity of short-term bank deposits was three days 2008: 12 days.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate to book value due to their short maturities.

The weighted average interest rate paid on fixed interest borrowings is 5.1 per cent 2008: 5.0 per cent.
Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
The fair value of fixed interest rate loans is 613 million, compared to their carrying value of 606 million 2008: 602 million compared to their book value of 600 million.
The floating rate loans payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.
Thus the fair value of these instruments approximates to their book value.

The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2008 and 2009.
By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses.
There has been no change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
The Treasury Committee of the Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies are regularly reviewed.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to hedge movements in the price paid for lumber.
These options and futures hedging contracts mature within one year and all are with organised exchanges.
The Groups policy is to control credit risk by only entering into financial instruments with authorised counterparties after taking account of their credit rating.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
The Group aims to maintain this ratio in the range of 1.50 to 2.25.
The Groups main borrowing facilities all contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to 3.5:1.
In addition, the Group monitors the ratio of net debt to shareholders funds such that it is consistent with the Groups targeted ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
At 31 July 2009 the ratio of net debt to shareholders funds was 28.4 per cent 2008: 73.5 per cent.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and bolt-on acquisitions for the following financial year with an additional contingent safety margin.
Large acquisitions are funded shortly before the acquisition is made.
As at 31 July 2009, the Group had undrawn centrally managed facilities maturing as follows: 2009 2008 facility facility m m Less than one year 100 200 Between two and three years 683 Between three and four years 43 759 Between four and five years 852 200 Wolseley plc 111 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2009 29.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows including interest payable in respect of its bank and construction loan borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows: Construction Interest rate loan Interest on and currency Debt borrowings debt swaps Total As at 31 July 2009 m m m m m Due in less than one year 5 163 61 29 258 Due in one to two years 125 56 6 187 Due in two to three years 830 33 1 864 Due in three to four years 49 30 79 Due in four to five years 1 29 30 Due in over five years 614 188 802 Total 1,624 163 397 36 2,220 Construction loan Interest on Interest rate Debt borrowings debt swaps Total As at 31 July 2008 m m m m m Due in less than one year 274 237 122 8 641 Due in one to two years 2 116 118 Due in two to three years 106 112 218 Due in three to four years 1,625 40 1,665 Due in four to five years 159 31 190 Due in over five years 548 166 714 Total 2,714237587 83,546 During the year ended 31 July 2009 facilities amounting to 1,017 million matured, were cancelled or were repaid early.
A forward start multi-currency syndicated facility of 1 billion 853 million was arranged, which was a restatement and extension of the Groups existing 2.8 billion facility.
This facility will commence when the existing facility matures on 1 August 2011 or is cancelled by the Group prior to this date, and will expire on 1 August 2013.
Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 40 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars and 24 per cent in euros.
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposure.
However, those that do arise are generally hedged with either forward contracts or currency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Groups overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund growth in those territories.
The Groups policy for the year ended 31 July 2009 and subsequently is to adjust the currencies in which its debt is denominated to match the currencies in which its trading profits are generated, as this hedges the ratio of net debt to EBITDA in the covenant calculation.
Net debt at 31 July 2009 can be analysed by currency as follows: Cash, overdrafts Currency Trading Interest Finance lease and bank bought sold investment rate swaps obligations loans forward Total As at 31 July 2009 m m m m m m Sterling 4 218 251 37 US dollars 38 11 457 230 660 Euros 25 49 566 440 200 Other 155 7 259 49 62 Total 155 13 71 1,064 8 959 112 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors report Business review Directors report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 29.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Groups policy for the year ended 31 July 2008 and earlier was to maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies of its operating companies as this hedged both the net assets and cash flows of the Group.
Net debt at 31 July 2008 could be analysed by currency as follows: Cash, overdrafts Currency Trading Interest Finance lease and bank bought sold investment rate swaps obligations loans forward Total As at 31 July 2008 m m m m m m Sterling 4 54 119 169 US dollars 5 1 21 695 89 621 Euros 6 52 1,424 361 1,831 Other 10 330 154 186 Total 57 87 2,395 1 2,469 Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary on page 141.
The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by 2,439 million 16.5 per cent 2008: 324 million, or 2.0 per cent and to increase trading profit by 147 million 18.7 per cent 2008: 18 million, or 2.0 per cent.
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against each of the major currencies with which the Group is involved as follows: 2009 2008 Strengthening Strengthening weakening weakening of sterling of sterling US dollar 27.3% 2.6 % Euros 16.2% 10.0% Interest rate risk To manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Groups policy is that at least 20 per cent of bank borrowings required during the next two years should be at fixed rates.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at both Treasury Committee and Board meetings.
The Treasury Committee gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are exposed to both fair value interest rate risk fixed rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk floating rate borrowings.
The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt at 31 July 2009 and 31 July 2008, after including the effect of interest rate swaps, is set out in the following tables.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Credit risk Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding balances.
North American Loan Services also provides loans to finance the construction of properties.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding loan balances.
At 31 July 2009 the maximum exposure to credit risk was 2,031 million 2008: 2,830 million of which 163 million 2008: 237 million is secured against homes under construction or completed homes awaiting sale.
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In many cases, protection is provided through lien rights on projects, or through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based.
Historic write-off rates are low and appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
North American Loan Services construction loans are secured on the related properties and are managed by a dedicated lending team within that business.
Policies are also applied to provide further protection and KPIs are monitored regularly by management outside the business.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of 850 million 2008: 346 million.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, all of which have credit ratings equivalent to Standard & Poors A or higher.
The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that the maximum effect of a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates on the Groups continuing businesses would result in a charge to the income statement of 4 million 2008: 25 million and a charge to equity of 4 million 2008: 9 million.
Similarly, it is estimated that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does business would result in a charge to the income statement of 2 million 2008: nil and a charge to equity of 122 million 2008: 293 million.
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Groups exposure to any of the macro-economic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.

The environmental and legal provision includes known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated.
Included in this provision is an amount of 42 million 2008: 36 million related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies.
This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2009 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
Asbestos related litigation is covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables note 21.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 4.3 per cent 2008: 4.6 per cent.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow impact is expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
There were 273 claims outstanding at 31 July 2009 2008: 293.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs, future lease rentals on closed branches and asset write-downs.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately five years.
Other provisions mainly consist of separation costs relating to the disposal of Stock, rental commitments on vacant properties other than those arising from restructuring actions, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.

Retirement benefit obligations i Description of plans United Kingdom The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes retirement benefits are funded by a salary sacrifice arrangement from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
Employees salary sacrifice either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits accruing.
The Group contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
During the year, this scheme was closed to new members and a defined contribution plan was established.
However employees in the eligibility period on 31 May 2009 are still able to join when they reach the end of their eligibility period.
Outside the United Kingdom North America The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2009 the cost of defined contribution plans of continuing operations charged to the income statement was 21 million 2008: 17 million.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada, a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
One of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded: two plans are closed to new entrants.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme.
The remaining schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
Europe Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2009 the cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was 22 million 2008: 20 million.
Post-retirement healthcare There are no material obligations to provide post-retirement healthcare benefits.
The Group expects to contribute 40 million to the UK defined benefit schemes in the year ending 31 July 2010 and 11 million to the non-UK defined benefit schemes.

The expected equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return determined by reference to government bond rates in the countries in which the plans are based plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities.
For the UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 3.2 per cent per year as at 31 July 2009 2008: 3.4 per cent over the expected return from government bonds.
For the principal overseas schemes in USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities and 25 per cent in other asset classes, principally bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group.
For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

Allotment of shares during the year On 1 April 2009 the Company issued 225 million ordinary 25 pence shares by way of a share placing at 120 pence per share.
On 2 April 2009 the Company reorganised its share capital.
The 886,988,540 ordinary 25 pence shares then in issue were split into 886,988,540 ordinary 1 penny shares and 886,988,540 deferred 24 pence shares.
The 1 penny shares were then consolidated into 88,698,854 ordinary 10 pence shares.
On 21 April 2009 the Company issued 195,137,478 ordinary 10 pence shares by way of an 11 for 5 rights issue at a price of 400 pence per share.
The share placing and rights issue generated net proceeds to the Group of 994 million after costs of 52 million and excluding shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
In addition, from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009, shares in the Company were issued to satisfy options exercised under the Companys share schemes.
A summary of the movements in the year is detailed in the following table: 2009 2008 Number of 25 pence ordinary shares in issue at 1 August 661,982,888 661,165,224 Exercise of savings related share options 5,652 394,962 Exercise of executive share options 422,702 Share placing April 2009 225,000,000 Capital reorganisation 886,988,540 Number of 25 pence ordinary shares in issue at 31 July 661,982,888 Number of 10 pence ordinary shares in issue after capital reorganisation in which ordinary 1 penny shares converted to ordinary 10 pence shares April 2009 88,698,854 Rights issue of 10 pence ordinary shares April 2009 195,137,478 Exercise of savings related share options 3,034 Number of 10 pence ordinary shares in issue at 31 July 283,839,366 Number of 24 pence deferred shares in issue after capital reorganisation 886,988,540 Number of 24 pence deferred shares in issue at 31 July 886,988,540 The deferred shares have no voting rights, no entitlement to a dividend and cannot be traded.
Employee Benefit Trusts Three Employee Benefit Trusts have been established in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme.
During the year the trusts participated in the rights issue and consequently purchased 1,361,760 shares for 5.4 million.
The market value of the 1,978,037 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts at 31 July 2009, which have a nominal value of 0.25 million, was 26 million 2008: 21 million.
During the year, 6,413 shares have been allocated from the Employee Benefit Trust to employees under the Restricted Share Plan.
Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.

Share-based payments The Group operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 collectively, the Executive Option Schemes : the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1981, the Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2000 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 collectively, the Employees Savings Option Schemes : and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 the ESPP.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years.
Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years.
Awards granted under the ESPP vest over a one-year period.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan RSP for senior executives.
Under the LTIS, executives are awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies.
The vesting period is three years.
The maximum award under the scheme is determined at grant date and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition.
Under the RSP, executives excluding Directors are granted free shares.
The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment.
Following the capital reorganisation and share issue which was completed during April 2009, appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect of both transactions on outstanding awards.
The calculations were made in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs recommendations HMRC.
Such calculations were reviewed by the Companys auditors, who performed specific procedures to recalculate the adjustments made to outstanding awards, on the basis that the Directors of the Company deemed the adjustments to be fair and reasonable.
After adjustments had been made to outstanding awards to reflect the capital reorganisation, a further adjustment was made using the theoretical ex-rights price calculation TERP as agreed with HMRC.
All outstanding awards made under the Companys share plans were multiplied by a TERP factor of 2.398177677 and the respective option prices and market prices at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.416983283.
These formulae were designed to minimise the effect of the capital reorganisation and the share issue upon outstanding awards and, subject to roundings, ensured that the overall value of outstanding awards was the same after adjustment.

The fair value of shares granted under the RSP was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Long Term Incentive Executive Share Options Employee Share Options Schemes 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Risk free interest rate 4.09% 4.93% 2.17% 4.19% 3.66% 4.93% Expected annual increase in dividends n a 10.00% n a 10.00% n a n a Expected dividend yield n a n a n a n a 1.04% 2.94% Expected volatility 35.82% 26.15% 47.86% 31.03% 45.00% 25.00% Expected life 5.8 years 5.7 years 17 years 17 years 3 years 3 years The initial assumption was a dividend yield of zero up to 31 July 2010 2008: 11.94 pence and 23.71 pence for interim and final dividends respectively.
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due to the capital reorganisation and rights issue.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

However, the rights issue was effected through a structure which resulted in the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued being recognised within retained earnings under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting standards and interpretations that are not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2009 or later periods, but which the Group has not early adopted.
The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Groups operations are as follows: Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment applicable from 1 August 2009 This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Groups future financial statements.
IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations and amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements applicable from 1 August 2009 These amendments make a number of changes to the method of accounting for business combinations, including a requirement to expense acquisition costs and to measure contingent consideration at fair value at acquisition date, and then record subsequent changes to the estimate in the income statement.
IAS 1 revised Presentation of financial statements applicable from 1 August 2009 This amendment requires information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and introduces a statement of comprehensive income.
Preparers will have the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements a separate income statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this interpretation on the Groups future financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs applicable from 1 August 2009 This amendment requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs, to the extent they are directly attributable to the acquisition, production or construction of assets that need a period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation applicable from 1 August 2009 IFRIC 16 provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: where, within a group, hedging instruments that are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation can be held to qualify for hedge accounting: and how an entity should determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
