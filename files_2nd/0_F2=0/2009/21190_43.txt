Financial statements MCEV 289 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M1 Basis of preparation The condensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of financial position on pages 284 to 286 present the groups results and financial position for the life and related businesses on the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV basis and for its non-life businesses on the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
The MCEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the MCEV Principles published by the CFO Forum in October 2009.
The directors consider that the MCEV methodology gives useful insight into the drivers of financial performance of the groups life and related businesses.
This basis values future cash flows from assets consistently with market prices, including more explicit allowance for the impact of uncertainty in future investment returns and other risks.
Embedded value is also consistent with the way pricing is assessed and the business is managed.
The results for 2009 and 2008 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young.
Their report in respect of 2009 can be found on page 316 in the Report and Accounts.
CFO Forum principles update The CFO Forum issued updated MCEV Principles and Guidance in October 2009, replacing the guidance issued in June 2008.
The main change was to permit the use of liquidity premium on contracts with predictable cashflows.
Avivas methodology of applying liquidity premium to contracts where backing assets can be held to maturity is unchanged.
Further details are given on page 308.
Avivas methodology is compliant with the updated CFO Forum Principles.
Covered business The MCEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
Covered business includes the groups share of our joint ventures including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG and our associated undertakings in India, China, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.
In addition, the results of group companies providing significant administration, fund management and other services and of group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
New business premiums New business premiums include: premiums arising from the sale of new contracts during the period: non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums: and expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts.
The groups definition of new business under MCEV includes contracts that meet the definition of non-participating investment contracts under IFRS.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are considered to represent new business where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-defined and reasonably predictable.
For group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Life and pensions operating earnings For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns.
The use of asset risk premia reflects managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes.
Within the 2008 results, the normalised investment returns were calculated by reference to the one year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium for bonds, equities and properties.
For 2009, the group considers that the return over the typical duration of the assets held is more appropriate and is more consistent with the groups expectation of longterm rates of return.
Therefore, the expected return on equities and properties has been calculated by reference to the 10 year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium.
The expected return on bonds has been calculated by reference to the swap rate consistent to the duration of the backing assets in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium.
This assumption does not impact the embedded value as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned.
MCEV methodology Overview Under the MCEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
290 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash flows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
Where gross results are presented, these have been calculated by grossing up post-tax results at the full rate of corporation tax for each country based on opening period tax rates, apart from the US, where a nil tax rate has been used in the post-tax results, and consequently for grossing up.
Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any nonadmissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
Required capital is the market value of assets attributed to the covered business over and above that required to back liabilities for covered business, for which distribution to shareholders is restricted.
Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity level.
The level of required capital for each business unit is set equal to the higher of: The level of capital at which the local regulator is empowered to take action: The capital requirement of the business unit under the groups economic capital requirements: and The target capital level of the business unit.
This methodology reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business, and includes any additional shareholder funds not available for distribution, such as the reattributed inherited estate in the UK.
The same definition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus is the market value of any assets allocated to, but not required to support, the in-force covered business at the valuation date.
The level of required capital across the business units expressed as a percentage of the EU minimum solvency margin or equivalent can be found on page 308.
Value of in-force covered business VIF The value of in-force covered business consists of the following components: present value of future profits: time value of financial options and guarantees: frictional costs of required capital: and cost of residual non-hedgeable risks.
Present value of future profits PVFP This is the present value of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis.
Distributable profits generally arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with any local statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using assumptions of future experience.
Future profits are projected using best estimate non-economic assumptions and market consistent economic assumptions.
In principle, each cash flow is discounted at a rate that appropriately reflects the riskiness of that cash flow, so higher risk cash flows are discounted at higher rates.
In practice, the PVFP is calculated using the certainty equivalent approach, under which the reference rate is used for both the investment return and the discount rate.
This approach ensures that asset cash flows are valued consistently with the market prices of assets without options and guarantees.
Further information on the risk-free rates is given in note M18.
The PVFP includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
Financial statements MCEV 291 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M1 Basis of preparation continued Time value of financial options and guarantees TVOG The PVFP calculation is based on a single base economic scenario.
However, a single scenario cannot appropriately allow for the effect of certain product features.
If an option or guarantee affects shareholder cash flows in the base scenario, the impact is included in the PVFP and is referred to as the intrinsic value of the option guarantee.
However, future investment returns are uncertain and the actual impact on shareholder profits may be higher or lower.
The value of in-force business needs to be adjusted for the impact of the range of potential future outcomes.
Stochastic modelling techniques can be used to assess the impact of potential future outcomes, and the difference between the intrinsic value and the total stochastic value is referred to as the time value of the option or guarantee.
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash flows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Under a market consistent approach, the economic scenarios generated reflect the markets tendency towards risk aversion.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
Stochastic models are calibrated to market yield curves and volatility levels at the valuation date.
Tests are performed to confirm that the scenarios used produce results that replicate the market price of traded instruments.
Where evidence exists that persistency rates are linked to economic scenarios, dynamic lapse assumptions are set that vary depending on the individual scenarios.
This cost is included in the TVOG.
Dynamic lapses are modelled for parts of the US and French businesses.
Asymmetries in non-economic assumptions that are linked to economic scenarios, but that have insufficient evidence for credible dynamic assumptions, are allowed for within mean best estimate assumptions.
Frictional costs of required capital The additional costs to a shareholder of holding the assets backing required capital within an insurance company rather than directly in the market are called frictional costs.
They are explicitly deducted from the PVFP.
The additional costs allowed for are the taxation costs and any additional investment expenses on the assets backing the required capital.
The level of required capital has been set out above in the net worth section.
Frictional costs are calculated by projecting forwards the future levels of required capital.
Tax on investment return and investment expenses are payable on the assets backing required capital, up until the point that they are released to shareholders.
Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR The cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR covers risks not already allowed for in the time value of options and guarantees or the PVFP.
The allowance includes the impact of both non-hedgeable financial and non-financial risks.
The most significant risk not included in the PVFP or TVOG is operational risk.
The methodology includes a cost of non-hedgeable risk equivalent to a charge of 2.5% applied to group-diversified capital.
The cost has been calculated as a 1.5% charge applied to business unit-level capital that is, allowing for diversification within a business unit, but not between business units.
The charge was set so as to give an aggregate allowance that was in excess of the expected operational risk costs arising from the in-force covered business over its remaining lifetime.
The capital levels used are projected to be sufficient to cover non-hedgeable risks at the 99.5% confidence level one-year after the valuation date.
The capital is equal to the capital from the ICA results for those risks considered.
The capital has been projected as running off over the remaining life of the in-force portfolio in line with the drivers of the capital requirement.
In addition to the operational risk allowance, financial non-hedgeable risks and other product level asymmetries have been allowed for.
These allowances are not material as significant financial non-hedgeable risks and product level asymmetries are either modelled explicitly and included in the TVOG or are included in the PVFP through the use of appropriate best estimate assumptions.
Asymmetric risks allowed for in the TVOG or PVFP are described earlier in the Basis of preparation.
No allowance has been made within the cost of non-hedgeable risk for symmetrical risks as these are diversifiable by investors.
Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future market-consistent returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the TVOG.
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benefits and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, the apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders and shareholders reflect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Under certain economic scenarios where additional shareholder injections are required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the TVOG.
The embedded value of the US spread-based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees.
This includes the ability to change the crediting rates and indexed strategies available within the policy.
Consideration is taken of the economic environment assumed in future projections and returns in excess of the reference rate are not assumed.
Anticipated market and policyholder reaction to management action has been considered.
The anticipated management action is consistent with current decision rules and has been approved and signed off by management and legal counsel.
292 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 M1 Basis of preparation continued Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between group life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements have been included in the results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the MCEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non-insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the MCEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and value of new business calculations for the relevant business, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non-insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing statement of financial positions, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
The assessments of goodwill, intangibles and pension schemes relating to life insurance business utilise the IFRS measurement basis.
Restatements i Following a review, the scope of business using adjusted swap rates has been increased to cover all contracts that contain features similar to immediate annuity contracts.
Prior year results have been restated to include the effect of adjusting the risk free rates on paid-up and single premium group deferred annuity business in Delta Lloyd and immediate annuities in France and Spain.
At 31 December 2008, this increased the embedded value by 467 million and increased total earnings by 234 million in 2008.
The impact of these changes by country at 31 December 2008 was Delta Lloyd 352 million, France 48 million and Spain 67 million.
ii The 2008 figures for present value of new business premiums and value of new business have been restated to reclassify premium on Annual Renewable Term ART business in Spain as other operating existing business variances rather than new business.
There is no impact on profit.
iii The 2008 embedded value has been restated for the US, primarily reflecting modelling corrections in the valuation of assets on a market consistent basis identified in 2009. iv During 2009, the Group undertook a review of our accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents.
Previously, we defined these as normally having a maturity of three months or less from date of acquisition.
To avoid ambiguity, our accounting policy has been refined to impose a cut-off date of exactly three months, allowing us to delete normally from the policy wording.
This refinement of policy has resulted in a reclassification of certain short-dated instruments between cash and cash equivalents and financial investments.
The impact of this refinement has been to increase financial investments and reduce cash and cash equivalents in 2008 by 538 million compared to the amounts previously stated.
As a consequence of this, cash flows from operating activities in 2008 have decreased by 58 million, with the effect of exchange rate movements accounting for the remaining 50 million.
v During 2009, the Groups Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, carried out a review of the way it had been applying IAS 19, Employee Benefits, in its own financial statements where the corridor method of smoothing actuarial gains and losses in its pension schemes is followed: in accounting for its self-insured pension obligations and intercompany eliminations: and in its reporting to Group where the corridor accounting is reversed.
The review concluded that errors had been made locally in applying IAS 19 on the transition to IFRS and in subsequent years, such that gains on certain assets had been reported in provisions, to be released over time, rather than through other comprehensive income.
The impact of correcting these errors is to reduce provisions by 129 million as at 1 January 2008, increase deferred tax liabilities by 33 million and increase retained earnings at that date by 96 million.
Exchange rates The groups principal overseas operations during the period were located within the Eurozone and the United States.
The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated at the average rates for that period and the assets and liabilities have been translated at the period end rates.
Please refer to note 1 on page 151 of the IFRS financial statements.
Maintenance expense experience in the UK relates to profits from existing business administration.
Project and other related expenses in the UK reflect project costs associated with strategic initiatives, including developments designed to offer a wider range of products to customers, and the simplification of systems and processes.
Project and other related expenses in Delta Lloyd relate to integration costs in Belgium.
Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across a number of our businesses.
Persistency experience has been volatile across most of our businesses, in part reflecting wider economic volatility.
In France, positive persistency experience including the release of a short term provision, in line with positive underlying experience.
In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both Life and Pension products.
Other experience is favourable overall.
Both France and Italy include one off adjustments reflecting final commission payments from prior years.
The favourable impact in Italy reflects to one-off profit sharing on a reinsurance treaty.
The favourable impact in Delta Lloyd relates to the revised investment and bonus strategy in Germany following the decision to close this operation to new business.
The adverse impact in the USA relates to the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates.
Favourable expense assumption changes reflect the impact of cost reductions in Delta Lloyd and Poland, together with the impact of revisions to expense allocations in Delta Lloyd.
The adverse impact in Spain relates to the capitalisation of certain governance costs in respect of bancassurance joint ventures.
Favourable mortality assumption changes in France, Poland reflecting recent experience.
The adverse impact in the Delta Lloyd reflects the net impact of using updated mortality tables in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, following the issuance of revised advice from the respective actuarial associations.
Persistency assumptions have been strengthened across most of our businesses, in light of experience.
In Poland, persistency assumptions have been weakened following sustained favourable experience.
Other assumption changes in the US primarily relate to the timing of management action in setting policyholder credited rates.
In Delta Lloyd, the change represents tax effects resulting from a reallocation of assets.
Other operating variances in France, Poland and Asia have arisen as a result of more accurate modelling.
In the Delta Lloyd, these relate to revisions to investment and bonus strategies and expenses in Delta Lloyd Germany following the decision to close this operation to new business.
In Spain, these reflect the impact of re-pricing actions on risk products.
In Spain 34 million has been reclassified from value of new business to other operating variances.
Expenses in Delta Lloyd reflect an overrun in Belgium following the acquisition of Swiss Life Belgium, and restructuring within the intermediary division.
Lapse experience has been volatile, in part reflecting wider economic volatility.
In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both life and pension products.
In France, other experience profits include the reduction in value arising from reductions in fees and commissions received.
In Ireland, certain statutory provisions were increased following a review.
The movement in Delta Lloyd reflects changes on group pension scheme contribution.
In the USA, other experience reflects the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates.
In Delta Lloyd, expense assumptions have been updated following a review of expense allocations.
In UK, favourable mortality assumption changes are in respect of mortality and morbidity changes across a range of products.
In Delta Lloyd, mortality assumption changes reflect the impact of using a new industry mortality basis.
In the UK, an additional lapse provision has been set up in anticipation of higher short-term recession related withdrawals pre tax 50 million and higher mortgage and income protection claims pre tax 20 million to reflect rising unemployment.
In France, persistency assumptions have been weakened following continual favourable experience on AFER products.
In the UK, other operating assumption changes include the impact of the with-profit special distribution.
In Ireland, other assumption changes reflect a reduction in the assumed future tax charges.
In Poland, other assumptions reflect a change in the pattern of future mortality charging structure.
Other operating variances in France are mainly in respect of the impact of the mutualisation of funds following the merger of two legal entities.
In Delta Lloyd, changes are mainly in respect of aligning the profit sharing policy for existing group business in Belgium, following the acquisition of Swiss Life Belgium.

We have reported other non operating variances of 264 million for 2009 2008: loss 232 million.
This represents the impact on the Life MCEV of the reattribution of the inherited estate in the UK and the adverse impact of legislation changes relating to the capping of management changes on pension funds in Poland.
In 2008 the impact related to the settlement agreed by Delta Lloyd for its unit-linked policyholders, following an industry-wide challenge on the level of fees.
Acquired divested businesses consist of the disposal of our Australian life and pensions business and the IPO of Delta Lloyd in 2009.

The restatement in Spain of 38 million in 2008 is due to the reclassification of incremental premiums on annual renewable term contracts from new business to existing business.
For Delta Lloyd, the 2008 value of new business is a loss on a real world basis and so it is not possible to calculate a meaningful payback period.
Consequently the total and Europe average payback period excludes Delta Lloyd.

The cash flows projected are the expected future cash flows including expected investment cash flows from equities, bonds and properties earning a risk premium in excess of risk free, statutory reserves and required capital.
The risk premiums used are consistent with those used in the expected existing business contribution within operating earnings.
As the risk premiums are positive, a discount rate higher than risk-free is required to give a value equal to the market-consistent embedded value.
Average derived risk discount rates are shown below for the embedded value.

Financial statements MCEV 307 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M18 Pri ncipal economic assumptions a Economic assumptions Deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each reporting period.
In setting the risk-free rate we have, wherever possible used the mid-price swap yield curve for an AA-rated bank.
The curve is extrapolated if necessary to get rates suitable to the liabilities.
For markets in which there is no reliable swap yield curve the relevant government bond yields are used.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
The adjustments made to swap rates to derive a risk-free rate for immediate annuity type contracts and all US contracts are shown below the reference rate table.
The economic assumptions used in Delta Lloyd differ from those in the Eurozone as the Dutch bank swap rate is used by Delta Lloyd.
In current markets, the following adjustments are made to the swap rate for immediate annuity type contracts and all US contracts.
For 2008, the normalised investment returns were expressed as one year swap returns plus an asset risk premium.
For 2009, the normalised investment returns are expressed as a swap rate based on the typical duration of the assets held plus an asset risk premium.
More detail is given in note M1 Basis of Preparation.
The use of asset risk premia only impacts operating earnings as expected returns reflect managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the reference rate from investing in different asset classes.
This assumption does not impact the embedded value or value of new business as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned.
The asset risk premia set out in the table below are added to the ten year swap rate to calculate expected returns.
All territories 2009 2008 2007 Equity risk premium 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Property risk premium 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Future returns on corporate fixed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an adjustment for credit risk.
The required capital in the United Kingdom under MCEV is 100% for unit-linked and other non-participating business and 110% for annuity business.
with 200% for an immaterial amount of BPA business.
In addition, the reattribution of the inherited Estate has led to additional capital being locked in to support the with profit business, and this has been included within required capital.
Required capital in Italy under MCEV is 184% of the EU minimum for Eurovita and 115% for other companies.
Required capital in Spain is 125% of the EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.
This capital level is the aggregate capital required for Delta Lloyd.
Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is generally assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Where the fund is insufficient, and additional shareholder support is required, this is included within required capital, including the RIEESA in the UK.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
b Economic Assumptions Stochastic calculations The calculation of time value of options and guarantees allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix, bonus rates and rates of interest and other guarantees granted to policyholders.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
The embedded value of the US spread based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees.
Financial statements MCEV 309 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M18 Pri ncipal economic assumptions continued Model United Kingdom, Europe excluding Delta Lloyd and North America Swap rates are generated by a model, the LIBOR Market Model LMM, that projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals.
Forward rates are assumed to have a log-normal distribution which guarantees non-negative interest rates.
The model is calibrated to at-the-money swaptions of a variety of terms and tenors.
Swaption volatilities are taken from Bloomberg.
Tests have been performed to ensure that sufficient scenarios have been used that the result converges to the stochastic value of the business being valued.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year swaps plus an excess return.
This excess return is modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon.
This allows the model to capture the term structure of implied volatilities.
The model is calibrated to at-the-money options of a variety of terms.
Option volatilities are taken from a survey of investment banks.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
In the absence of liquid market data, the volatilities of these asset classes are based on historic data.
Assumptions for correlations between asset classes have been set based on historic data.
Model Delta Lloyd In Delta Lloyd, yield curves are based on fide Nederlandsche Bank DNB yield curve data.
The interest rate model used is a short rate G2 model.
The model is calibrated to the DNB yield curve and the swaption implied volatilities.
Swaption implied volatilities are taken from Bloomberg.
The equity model is a Heston model.
Asset classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds.
The most significant assumption is the distribution of future long-term interest rates, since this is the most important factor in the cost of guaranteed annuity options.
For many businesses, including US, France and Delta Lloyd, the most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various durations.

For the UK and Delta Lloyd, model property implied volatility is 15% for 31 December 2009 31 December 2008: 15%.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience with a view to giving a best estimate of future experience.
We have anticipated future changes in experience where that is appropriate, e. g. we have allowed for improvements in future policyholder longevity.
We have set the assumptions based on a best estimate of shareholder outcomes.
In particular, where the policyholder behaviour varies with economic experience, we have set assumptions which are dynamic, i. e. vary depending on the economic assumptions.
For example, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Additionally, where demographic experience is not driven by economic scenarios but is asymmetric on a stand-alone basis, the best estimate assumption considers the weighted-average expected experience, not simply the median or most likely outcome.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the MCEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business inforce and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to our life businesses, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and value of new business.
Non-hedgeable risk A charge of 2.5% has been applied to the group-diversified capital required on a 1-in-200 one-year basis over the remaining lifetime of in-force business.
c Other assumptions Valuation of debt Borrowings in the MCEV consolidated statement of financial position are valued on an IFRS basis, consistent with the primary financial statements.
At 31 December 2009 the market value of the groups external debt, subordinated debt, preference shares including General Accident plc preference shares of 250 million classified as minority interests and direct capital instrument was 6,634 million 31 December 2008: 4,911 million.

Financial statements MCEV 311 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M19 Sensitivity analysis a Economic assumptions The following tables show the sensitivity of the embedded value and the value of new business to: 10 basis point increase in the adjustment to risk free rates for immediate annuity type contracts and all US contracts: one and two percentage point increase and decrease in the risk-free rate, including all consequential changes including assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : 10% increase and decrease in market values of equity and property assets: 25% increase in equity and swaption volatilities: 50 basis point increase and decrease in credit spreads: and decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum or equivalent.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reflect sensitivity changes to future investment returns.
Some of the sensitivity scenarios may have consequential effects on valuation bases, where the basis for certain blocks of business is actively updated to reflect current economic circumstances.
Consequential valuation impacts on the sensitivities are allowed for where an active valuation basis is used.
Where businesses have a target asset mix, the portfolio is re-balanced after a significant market movement otherwise no re-balancing is assumed.
For new business, the sensitivities reflect the impact of a change immediately after inception of the policy.
In general, the magnitude of the sensitivities will reflect the size of the embedded values, though this will vary as the sensitivities have different impacts on the different components of the embedded value.
In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held.
The credit spread sensitivities assume that the change relates to credit risk and not liquidity risk: in practice, credit spread movements may be partially offset due to changes in liquidity risk.
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.
This can be seen in the sensitivity of a 1%2% movement in the interest rate for Delta Lloyd and US, where there is a significant amount of business with investment return guarantees.

Where there is a look through into service company expenses the fee charged by the service company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases: 10% decrease in lapse rates a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% pa would represent a lapse rate of 4.5% pa : and 5% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates disclosed separately for life assurance and annuity business.
No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions.
In each sensitivity calculation all other assumptions remain unchanged.
No changes to valuation bases have been included.
