BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes on financial statements 31.
Derivative financial instruments An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 24.
In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
IAS 39 prescribes strict criteria for hedge accounting, whether as a cash flow or fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and requires that any derivative that does not meet these criteria should be classified as held for trading and fair valued, with gains and losses recognized in the income statement.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 24.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.

This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all of the remaining contract term can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.
Changes in valuation from this initial valuation are recognized immediately through the income statement.
The following table shows the changes in the day-one profits and losses deferred on the balance sheet.

Derivative financial instruments continued The following table shows the fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities held for trading, analysed by maturity period and by methodology of fair value estimation.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy which consists of three levels that describe the methodology of estimation as follows: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 using inputs for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data such as prices based on internal models or other valuation methods.
This information is presented on a gross basis, that is, before netting by counterparty.
Derivative financial instruments continued The following table shows the changes during the year in the net fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included either within sales and other operating revenues or within purchases in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all of these items was a net gain of $3,735 million 2008 $6,721 million net gain and 2007 $376 million net gain.
Embedded derivatives Prior to the development of an active gas trading market, UK gas contracts were priced using a basket of available price indices, primarily relating to oil products, power and inflation.
After the development of an active UK gas market, certain contracts were entered into or renegotiated using pricing formulae not directly related to gas prices, for example, oil product and power prices.
In these circumstances, pricing formulae have been determined to be derivatives, embedded within the overall contractual arrangements that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity.
The resulting fair value relating to these contracts is recognized on the balance sheet with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
All the embedded derivatives are valued using inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from active market pricing data.
Where necessary, these are extrapolated to the expiry of the contracts the last of which is in 2018 using all available external pricing information.
Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are interpolated using historic and long-term pricing relationships.

Note 24 outlines the management of risk aspects for currency and interest rate risk.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
There were no highly probable transactions for which hedge accounting has been claimed that have not occurred and no significant element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges the pre-tax amount removed from equity during the period and included in the income statement is a loss of $366 million 2008 loss of $45 million and 2007 gain of $74 million.
Of this, a loss of $332 million is included in production and manufacturing expenses 2008 $1 million loss and 2007 $143 million gain and a loss of $34 million is included in finance costs 2008 $44 million loss and 2007 $69 million loss.
The amount removed from equity during the period and included in the carrying amount of non-financial assets was a loss of $136 million 2008 $38 million gain and 2007 $40 million gain.
The amounts retained in equity at 31 December 2009 are expected to mature and affect the income statement by a $146 million gain in 2010, a loss of $26 million in 2011 and a loss of $65 million in 2012 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2009, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The effectiveness of each hedge relationship is quantitatively assessed and demonstrated to continue to be highly effective.
The loss on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in 2009 was $98 million 2008 $2 million gain and 2007 $334 million gain offset by a gain on the fair value of the finance debt of $117 million 2008 $20 million loss and 2007 $327 million loss.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps have an average maturity of four to five years, 2008 three to four years and are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar denominated borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt.
Note 24 outlines the groups approach to interest rate risk management.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group held currency swap contracts as a hedge of a long-term investment in a UK subsidiary that expired in 2009.
At 31 December 2008, the hedge had a fair value of $2 million and the loss on the hedge recognized in equity in 2008 was $38 million 2007 $67 million loss.
US dollars had been sold forward for sterling purchased and matched the underlying liability with no significant ineffectiveness reflected in the income statement.
