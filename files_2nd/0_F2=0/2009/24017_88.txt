5 Recoverable VAT 2009 2008 000s 000s Recoverable VAT 1,350 A case has recently been brought against HMRC to seek to recover the amounts relating to the intervening period, 1997 to 2000, together with interest on a compound basis.
The Companys Auditors, PwC, have provided services in connection with this case for a fee of 35,000 see note 6.
Additional fees may become payable to PwC in the event of a successful outcome to the case, up to a maximum of 230,000.
No amounts have been accrued in this regard.
The potential recoveries of VAT and interest would be a significant multiple of the potential additional fees payable to PwC.
No VAT or related interest recovery has been accrued or recognised as a contingent asset, as the outcome of the case is expected to remain uncertain for several years.
