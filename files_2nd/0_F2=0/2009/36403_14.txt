26 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2009 Our financial position Financial results The Groups financial performance has been affected by the extremely difficult market conditions experienced during the financial year.
329p Net assets per share have fallen substantially since 31 March 2008 as a result of the fall adjusted net assets per share in value of the portfolio.
The underlying income statement results have been slightly more resilient primarily due to lower administration and interest costs.
Property sales and operational cash flow have reduced net debt over the year and the Groups leverage ratios remain at relatively conservative levels.
Net asset value Adjusted net assets per share fell by 43.5% in the year to 329 pence, largely because of the reduction in the value of the property portfolio.
At 31 March 2009, the Groups net assets were 568.6 million, down from 1,049.4 million at March 2008.

Triple net assets per share NNNAV was 336 pence at 31 March 2009 compared to 590 pence a year earlier.
At year end the difference between adjusted net assets per share and NNNAV was the positive mark to market of debt of 7 pence arising from the low interest rate of the Groups 2029 debenture partially offset by a negative value of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
There were no movements in deferred tax provisions during the period.
Income statement and earnings per share Rental income and joint venture fees for the year were 42.4 million and 4.7 million respectively, generating a combined income of 47.1 million, 6.2% lower than last year.
Rental income was 2.0 million down on last year partly due to the lease expiries at Buchanan House, EC1 and Pollen House, W1.
Rent reviews, lease renewals and new lettings added 10.3 million to rental income during the year.
The estimated rental value of the portfolio declined by 18.5% in the year, due to the challenging occupational market.
The Groups joint ventures generated management fees of 4.7 million down 19.0% on last year, as a result of disposals and constrained development activity at GVP2, GWP and GCP.
Adjusted profit before tax of 21.9 million was 1.9 million or 8.0% lower than 2008.
The decline was caused by reduced development management profits and lower underlying joint venture profits partly mitigated by a fall in administration and interest costs.
