Profits made overseas will not be able to be offset by costs elsewhere in the Group.
This could lead to a higher than expected tax rate for the Group.
Taxation in Ukraine The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
Ukrainian tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development, with new laws coming into effect at times which can conflict with others and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
Managements interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may at times not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
Since PPCs inception in 1994 the Company has operated in a regime where conflicting laws have often existed, including in relation to effective taxes on oil and gas production.
Various laws and regulations have existed and have implied a number of variable rates.
