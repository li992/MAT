b derivatives: foreign currency forward purchase contracts The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US dollar.
The Groups policy is to reduce the risk associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The foreign exchange contracts do not meet the criteria for treatment as an effective hedge and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 26 april 2009 27 april 2008 000 000 Fair value of derivative financial instruments - liabilities 34,993 47,638 60 Financial Statements The sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 26 april 2009 27 april 2008 000 000 US dollar purchases 350,000 1,081,668 Contracted rates 1.46-1.88 1.86 2.00 US dollar sales 250,000 397,000 Contracted rates 1.92-1.94 1.92-1.98 Euro sales 202,179 259,716 Contracted rates 1.08-1.40 1.25 1.40 Euro purchases 223,662 - Contracted rates 1.12-1.12 - Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
At 26 April 2009 no purchase contracts and no sale contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2008: 250 million of purchase contracts.
c sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity: income statement equity 26 april 2009 27 april 2008 26 april 2009 27 april 2008 000 000 000 000 Sterling strengthens by 5% US dollar 11,044 32,603 11,044 32,603 Euro 4,580 12,367 4,580 12,367 Sterling weakens by 5% US dollar 11,596 34,233 11,596 34,233 Euro 4,809 12,986 4,809 12,986 Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
