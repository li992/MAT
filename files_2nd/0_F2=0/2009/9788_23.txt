The Group does not use derivatives to hedge income statement translation exposures.
In determining the fair value of a derivative, the appropriate quoted market price for an asset held is the bid price, and for a liability issued Critical accounting estimates and judgements is the offer price.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application At inception of a hedging relationship, the hedging instrument and of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are the hedged item are documented and prospective effectiveness continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and testing is performed.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as set out above.
The selection of these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement.
See note 14 for further details.
D. Post-retirement benefits The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes depends on the selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, mortality and expected return on scheme assets.
Differences arising from actual experiences or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods.
See note 11 for further details.
E. Refunds and loyalty scheme accruals Accruals for sales returns and loyalty scheme redemption are estimated on the basis of historical returns and redemptions and these are recorded so as to allocate them to the same period as the original revenue is recorded.
These accruals are reviewed regularly and updated to reflect managements latest best estimates, however, actual returns and redemptions could vary from these estimates.
Non-GAAP performance measures The directors believe that the adjusted profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business.
These measures are consistent with how underlying business performance is measured internally.
The adjusted profit before tax measure is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax are to exclude the following: exceptional income and charges These are one-off in nature and therefore create significant volatility in reported earnings: and profits and losses on the disposal of properties These can vary significantly from year to year, again creating volatility in reported earnings.
86 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Segmental information The Groups primary reporting segments are geographic, with the Group operating in two geographic areas being the UK and International.
The International segment consists of the Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with franchised operations.
The geographic segments disclose revenue, operating profit and segment assets and liabilities by destination and reflect management responsibility.
Within each geographic segment the Group sells both food and general merchandise and secondary segment disclosure is given for revenue.
Given that both food and general merchandise are sold from the same locations it is not practical to provide segmental information on operating assets and capital expenditure at this level.
2 Owned stores consist of the Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong, China and, since 29 February 2008, Greece, a number of other Balkan states and Switzerland, and since 20 March 2008, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were included in franchised stores up to that date.
3 Non-operating assets and liabilities include balances in respect of financing and taxation.
Revenue originates in the following geographical segments: United Kingdom 8,436.6m last year 8,595.3m and International 625.5m last year 426.7m.
The value of goods exported from the UK, including shipments to international subsidiaries, amounted to 560.7m last year 499.7m.

The exceptional pension credit has arisen due to changes in the UK defined benefit pension plan relating to how members benefits build up.
In January 2009 the Group announced that it had made changes to the scheme by capping employees annual increases in pensionable pay to 1% and changing the early retirement benefits for members who joined the scheme before 1996.
There is a credit to the income statement to reflect the impact of adjusting employees projected final pensionable salaries.
Last year the exceptional pension credit arose due to changes in the plan where, to the extent that members chose the option to limit their future pensionable salary increases to inflation, there was also a credit to the income statement.

90 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The adjusted earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings excluding the effect of property disposals and exceptional items.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

92 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Retirement benefits The Group provides pension arrangements for the benefit of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
This has a defined benefit section, which was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002, and a defined contribution section which has been open to new members with effect from 1 April 2003.
The defined benefit section operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 21,000 active members last year 24,000, 57,000 deferred members last year 58,000 and 42,000 pensioners last year 39,000.
At the year end, the defined contribution section had some 8,000 active members last year 8,000 and some 1,000 deferred members last year 1,000.
The Group also operates a small funded defined benefit pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
Retirement benefits also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement benefits.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost, excluding the exceptional pension credits, of 31.8m last year 44.2m, 14.0m last year 28.0m relates to the UK defined benefit section, 13.0m last year 11.7m to the UK defined contribution section and 4.8m last year 4.5m to other retirement benefit schemes.

Financial assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme was carried out at 31 March 2006 and showed a deficit of 704.0m.
The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Retirement Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes: 2009 2008 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 3.1 to 4.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service pre April 1997 2.6 2.8 between April 1997 and July 2005 2.9 3.5 post July 2005 2.3 2.4 Discount rate 6.8 6.8 Inflation rate 2.9 3.5 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.9 8.5 The amount of the deficit varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 deficit would decrease increase by c. 75m.
C. Demographic assumptions The demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme.
One of the most significant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2006 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the PMA92 and PFA92 tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 93 11 Retirement benefits continued 2009 2008 years years Current pensioners at age 65 males 21.2 21.0 females 23.6 23.5 Future pensioners at age 65 males 22.0 21.9 females 24.3 24.3 D. Analysis of assets and expected rates of return The major categories of assets as a percentage of total plan assets are: 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m % % Property partnership interest 529.8 506.6 13 10 UK equities 480.8 792.1 12 16 Overseas equities 644.3 1,116.6 16 22 Government bonds 127.2 465.4 3 9 Corporate bonds 2,278.0 2,058.5 58 41 Cash and other 83.1 106.3 2 2 3,977.0 5,045.5 100 100 The expected long-term rates of return are: 2009 2008 % % Property partnership interest 7.1 6.0 UK equities 8.0 8.3 Overseas equities 8.0 8.3 Government bonds 4.2 4.6 Corporate bonds 6.8 6.0 Cash and other 4.2 5.0 Overall expected return 7.2 6.7 The overall expected return on assets assumption is derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking views of financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
Consideration is also given to the rate of return expected to be available for reinvestment.
At year end, the UK scheme indirectly held 369,793 last year 479,356 ordinary shares in the Company through its investment in an Aquila Life UK Equity Index Fund.

The prepayment is in respect of annual contributions to the UK scheme at the rate of 23.7% of pensionable salaries up to 30 September 2009 and then 23.2% up to the next financial year.
It is estimated that approximately 66m of the prepayment will relate to the year ended 3 April 2010.

Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 62 to 71.
Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
HMRC rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the scheme.
2009 2008 Weighted Weighted Number of average exercise Number of average exercise options price options price Outstanding at beginning of the period 28,444,760 403.1p 33,241,616 327.6p Granted 42,551,459 203.0p 7,716,437 517.0p Exercised 2,075,204 232.7p 10,212,015 234.8p Forfeited 10,958,637 456.4p 2,207,700 450.7p Expired 99,317 261.8p 93,578 235.2p Outstanding at end of the period 57,863,061 252.2p 28,444,760 403.1p Exercisable at end of period 6,169,324 296.9p 948,372 262.9p For SAYE share options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 296.2p last year 535.2p.
The fair values of the options granted during the year have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below: 2009 2008 3-year plan 5-year plan 3-year plan 5-year plan Grant date Nov 08 Nov 08 Nov 07 Nov 07 Share price at grant date 253p 253p 646p 646p Exercise price 203p 203p 517p 517p Option life in years 3 years 5 years 3 years 5 years Risk-free rate 2.9% 3.2% 4.6% 4.6% Expected volatility 39.2% 33.4% 21.6% 25.2% Expected dividend yield 8.9% 8.9% 2.7% 2.7% Fair value of option 54.6p 43.9p 167.5p 201.8p Volatility has been estimated by taking the historic volatility in the Companys share price over a three or five year period.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years on the assumption that 20% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Group.
Executive Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme, last approved by shareholders in 2005, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to executive directors and senior managers at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the offer.
No further options may be granted under any schemes other than the 2005 scheme.
No awards have been made under the 2005 scheme.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 66.
Performance targets are assessed over a three year period from the date of grant with no ability to retest any grants.
Once options have vested they can be exercised during the period up to ten years from grant date.

The resulting fair value is expensed over the expected service period of five years on the assumption that 30% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Company.
Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on adjusted earnings per share growth over three years.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting.
Awards under this scheme have been made in each year since 2005.
During the year, 6,835,938 shares last year 3,414,413 were awarded under the plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 368.9p last year 704.0p.
D. Deferred Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005 06 as part of the Annual Bonus Scheme for approximately 450 of the most senior managers.
As part of the scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three years.
There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment, and the value of any dividends earned during the deferred period will be paid on vesting.
During the year, 288,656 shares last year 2,182,379 were awarded under the plan in relation to the annual bonus.
The fair value of the shares awarded was 381.6p last year 706.6p.
E. Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who are vital to the success of the business.
The plan operates for senior managers below executive director level.
Awards under the plan are made as part of ongoing reviews of reward packages, and for recruitment.
The shares are held in trust for a period of between one and three years, at which point they are released to the employee, subject to them still being in employment.
The value of any dividends earned during the restricted period will also be paid at the time of vesting.
During the year, 1,755,667 shares last year 328,165 have been awarded under the plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 337.8p last year 604.6p.
F. United Kingdom Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is a discretionary, all-employee plan, approved by HMRC, under which Freeshares may be allocated by the Company.
The last award was made in June 2003, which vested in June 2008.
G. Share Matching Deal Plan The Share Matching Deal Plan was introduced in 2006 for those employees who were eligible to receive a cash-only bonus.
The scheme was not open to those employees who participated in the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The plan allows employees to invest a proportion of their bonus in shares of the Company.
These investment shares must be held by the participant for three years, during which time they will receive dividends.
At the end of the three year holding period, if the participant is still in employment with the Company, and still holds the investment shares, they will receive one matching share for every four that they bought.
No shares were awarded under the Share Matching Deal Plan during the year.
H. Marks and Spencer Employee Benefit Trust The Marks and Spencer Employee Benefit Trust the Trust holds 4,203,250 last year 8,795,896 shares with a book value of 27.8m last year 60.0m and a market value of 11.1m last year 34.9m.
These shares were acquired by the Trust in the market.
In addition, the Trust has entered into a call option to purchase up to 6.3 million of the Companys shares.
The Trust used funds provided by Marks and Spencer plc to meet the Groups obligations.
Awards are granted to employees at the discretion of Marks and Spencer plc and shares awarded to employees by the Trust in accordance with the wishes of Marks and Spencer plc under senior executive share schemes, including the Restricted Share Plan.
Dividends are waived on all of these plans except for the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan where dividends are paid via a Dividend Reinvestment Plan for awards made in the form of forfeitable shares.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and changes in income and costs.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a three year period, which takes account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
Cash flows beyond this three year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital is used to discount the future cash flows.
A risk adjustment is then made for the countries in which the business unit operates: per una discount rate 10.2% last year 9.5% : Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. 12.2% and Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. 13.2%.
Based on the discounted cash flows the valuations indicate sufficient headroom that any reasonably possible change in the assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment.
Brands consist of the per una brand which is being amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
Additions to property, plant and equipment during the year amounting to 32.8m last year 23.5m were financed by new finance leases.

All such valuers are chartered surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The properties were valued on the basis of market value calculated based on subleases in place at the year end.
All valuations were carried out in accordance with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards.
As the investment properties are held at depreciated historical cost, this valuation has not been reflected in the carrying value of the assets.
No impairment has been recognised on the one property which is carried at a higher value than its market value at 28 March 2009.
However, the Group intends to re-occupy the property during 2009 10 at which point its value in use will exceed the net book value.
The Group received rental income of 1.2m last year 1.5m in respect of these investment properties.

Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is six years and 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
102 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Borrowings and other financial liabilities continued Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme Last year the partnership liability of 723.2m related to an amortising liability in respect of obligations of the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
During the year an interest charge of 38.0m was taken to the income statement representing the unwinding of the discount included in this obligation at an implied average interest rate of 5.7% last year 5.7%.
On 25 March 2009 the terms of the Scottish Limited Partnership agreement were amended to make the payment by the Scottish Limited Partnership of annual distributions to the Pension Scheme discretionary at the instance of Marks and Spencer plc in relation to financial years 2010 11 onwards.
This discretion is exercisable if the Group does not pay a dividend or make any other form of return to its shareholders.
As a result, the distributions to the Pension Scheme in 2009 and 2010 remain as financial liabilities, while the remaining financial instrument is now an equity instrument see note 26.
The agreement includes a clause such that, following a default event including the appointment of an administrator, liquidator, receiver or similar officer in respect of Marks and Spencer plc or Marks and Spencer Group plc and the winding up or dissolution of Marks and Spencer plc or Marks and Spencer Group plc or on a relevant change of law, the net present value of the outstanding distributions becomes payable to the Pension Scheme by the Scottish Limited Partnership at the option of the Pension Scheme.
On the basis of the expected cash flows associated with such an event, the related financial liability has been fair valued at nil.
22 Financial instruments Treasury policy and financial risk management The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
Group treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: a Liquidity funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due at a reasonable price.
The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.2bn set to mature on 26 March 2013.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable: to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
In addition, the term out option under the 400m credit agreement which expired on 13 February 2009 was converted into a committed facility for the same period, expiring on 11 February 2010.
This facility has the same financial covenant as the main 1.2bn facility.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 105m last year 155m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of 764m last year 614m was drawn under the committed facilities and nil last year a further 29m was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.4bn last year 1.4bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
b Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suffer financial loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions.
Exposures are managed through Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings A A1 or better assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively, unless approved on an exception basis by a Board director.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.
The table below analyses the Groups cash and cash equivalents and derivative assets by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash and cash in transit.
2 Excludes derivative asset option which is embedded within the 250m puttable callable reset medium-term notes due 2037.
3 Exposure to A A2 counterparty approved as an exception to treasury policy.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 84m last year 85m, other receivables 64m last year 46m, cash and cash equivalents 423m last year 318m and derivatives 347m last year 37m.
104 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedge these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate hedge cover can be taken out longer than 18 months with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in equity.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables then associated fair value movements previously recognised in equity are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 768m last year 619m with a weighted average maturity date of six months last year seven months.
The translation exposures arising on the overseas net assets are hedged with foreign currency debt.
As at the balance sheet date, 276m last year 243m and HK$178m last year HK$107m currency debt was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 108m last year 80m.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 28 March 2009 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 14 months last year 19 months from the balance sheet date.
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities is as set out below excluding short-term payables and the Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. put option: 2009 2008 Fixed Floating Fixed Floating rate rate rate rate Total Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 2,252.4 629.9 2,882.3 2,665.9 673.0 3,338.9 Euro 7.6 286.1 293.7 192.5 192.5 Hong Kong dollar 16.4 16.4 6.9 6.9 Other 0.3 7.9 8.2 2,260.3 940.3 3,200.6 2,665.9 872.4 3,538.3 The floating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and three months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases but including the partnership liability, the fixed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 6.0% last year 6.0% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is nine years last year ten years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the sterling, US dollar, euro and Hong Kong dollar variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date fixed rate borrowings amounted to 2,260.3m last year 2,665.9m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, and amounting to 71% last year 75% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 4.0 5.5 Medium-term notes 6.2 6.2 Finance leases 4.8 5.0 Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme 5.7 5.7 105 22 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that a 2% last year 1% - movement in interest rates and a 20% last year 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling represents reasonable possible changes.
However, this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on the Groups floating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity reflects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact from foreign exchange movements reflects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash flow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.

The attributes of these derivatives match the characteristics of the underlying debt hedged with rates of 7.034% 2017 bond and 7.238% 2037 bond.
The amounts reported as options held for trading in derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of the call option with the puttable callable reset notes mirrored by the fair value of the sold option to have this call assigned.
During the year the Group entered into energy swap contracts to fix a portion of the forecast energy usage for the 2009 10 financial year.
These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Fair value of financial instruments With the exception of the Groups fixed rate bond debt, there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups fixed rate bond debt was 2,018.5m last year 1,859.2m, the fair value of this debt was 1,616.6m last year 1,740.7m.

Undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries amount to 380.6m last year 295.1m.
The Group is claiming UK tax relief for losses incurred by some of its current and former European subsidiaries.
In light of continuing litigation, no asset has been recognised in respect of these claims.
