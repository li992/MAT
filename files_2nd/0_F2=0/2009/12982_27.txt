THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C 36 Contingent assets Group The Group has lodged a claim for the repayment of VAT alleging that the tax treatment of gaming machines was inconsistently applied and therefore breached the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality.
In August 2008, the VAT and Duties Tribunal ruled that, from November 2003 at least, the UKs VAT treatment of certain types of gaming machine was inconsistent with the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality.
This was an interim decision and a second stage was heard at the VAT and Duties Tribunal in October 2009.
The latest ruling was also in favour of the Group.
Consequently, the Groups claim is valid for the entire period under dispute 2002-2005.
The Group has requested payment of the claim, although HMRC have appealed and final resolution may take a number of years.
The claim is estimated to be worth as much as 26m plus interest.
In December 2009, HMRC issued guidance that claims for VAT overpaid on main stage bingo will be treated in the same way as the Groups successful claim for overpaid VAT on interval bingo received in November 2008.
The Group has submitted a claim for VAT overpaid on main stage bingo for periods from July 2004.
If successful, the Group estimates the net cash benefit to be as much as 16m plus interest.
HMRC are continuing to appeal the ruling of the VAT and Duties Tribunal that the application of VAT on some games of interval bingo contravened the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality and its appeal will be heard at the Court of Appeal in April 2010.
In the event of an adverse ruling on the interval bingo claim, the Groups main stage bingo claim will not be paid and the interval bingo claim will have to be repaid see note 37.
The Group has lodged a number of claims following the House of Lords decision in the Conde Nast Fleming cases on the applicability of the three year cap that HMRC introduced to limit VAT reclaims.
These claims, which had to be submitted by March 2009, are based on managements best estimates from the information available and the Group expects the valuation of each claim to be reviewed by HMRC before settlement.
In a number of cases, the Conde Nast claims are subject to successful outcomes of other claims for the repayment of VAT including the claims in the preceding paragraphs, the outcome of which is not certain.
One of the claims identified above is for the repayment of VAT on some games of interval bingo covering the period from 1996 back to 1980, when the interval bingo product was introduced.
This claim has been made under the Conde Nast Fleming ruling detailed above and HMRC issued guidance in January 2010 that this type of claim could be paid once the amount has been verified.
As a result, the Group anticipates receiving as much as 35m plus interest during 2010.
The Group has not recognised any gain in its financial statements at 31 December 2009 in respect of the above items.
37 Contingent liabilities Group On 10 November 2008, the Group received 59.1m in overpaid VAT from HMRC, following the VAT and Duties Tribunals ruling in May 2008 that the application of VAT to some games of interval bingo contravened the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality.
HMRC appealed the ruling of the Tribunal at a High Court hearing in March 2009, but the judgement found in favour of the Group.
The benefit from the ruling on interval bingo continued to be recognised in the accounts for the first 17 weeks of 2009, covering the period to 26 April 2009, when bingo became exempt from VAT.
HMRC lodged an appeal to the Court of Appeal on 6 July 2009, but the hearing is not due to be held until April 2010.
In the event of an adverse ruling, Rank would be required to repay the 59.1m and amounts not paid over for the period from July 2008 to 26 April 2009 plus interest.
Company 2009 2008 m m Guarantees of advances to subsidiary undertakings 236.8 166.6 No security has been given in respect of any contingent liability.
