Tax losses with a net tax value of $517m 2008 $553m, including capital losses with a value of $196m 2008 $160m, have not been recognised.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely with the exception of $1m which expires after 15 years, $1m which expires after nine years and $14m which expires after seven years 2008 $1m which expires after three years.
Deferred tax assets with a net tax value of $9m 2008 $4m in respect of share-based payments, $13m 2008 $13m in respect of employee benefits and $7m 2008 $8m in respect of other items have not been recognised.
These losses and other deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the Group does not anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benefits may arise depending on future profits arising or on the outcome of EU case law and legislative developments.
At 31 December 2009, the Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Following introduction of a UK dividend exemption regime, the tax which would arise upon reversal of the temporary differences is not expected to exceed $20m.
Other short-term temporary differences relate primarily to provisions and accruals and share-based payments.
