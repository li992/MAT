Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The Companys share of the schemes assets at the balance sheet date were: 2009 2008 m m Equities 13.6 16.7 Property currency 2.3 3.2 Bonds 10.2 12.2 Other 3.5 1.8 29.6 33.9 The expected return on schemes assets is determined by considering the long-term returns and the balance between risk and reward on the various categories of investment assets held.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
In conjunction with its investment advisers, the trustees have structured the schemes investments with the objective of balancing investment returns and levels of risk.
The asset allocation has three main elements: holding of bonds which is expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects the schemes liabilities a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a relatively small proportion of the schemes assets circa 10% in alternative asset classes which give the potential for gaining higher returns property and currency.
Equities held by the scheme are spread between the UK and international markets circa 50% each.
The Group provides retirement benefits to some of its former and approximately 42% 2008 49% of current employees through defined benefit schemes.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on final annual salary earned in employment.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
An alternative method of valuation to the projected unit credit method is a solvency basis, which is estimated using the cost of buying-out benefits with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the on-going liabilities.
The Group estimates the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date was 566m.
