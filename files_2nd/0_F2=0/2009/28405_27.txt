All of the above activities relate to continuing operations as defined in IFRS 5.
Consistent with the treatment in prior years, the Yes Car Credit operation has been classified as part of continuing operations on the basis that revenue and impairment has continued to be generated from the loan book up until full collect-out of the loan book and closure of the collections operation in 2009.
Revenue between business segments is not material.
All of the groups operations operate in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Segment net assets are based on the statutory accounts of the companies forming the groups business segments adjusted to assume repayment of intra-group balances and rebasing the borrowings of the Consumer Credit Division to reflect a borrowings to receivables ratio of 80%.
The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to the Consumer Credit Division of 129.1m 2008: 66.7m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
For share options and awards, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options and awards.

The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2009 was 100% for the Consumer Credit Division 2008: 100%, 40% for Vanquis Bank 2008: 38% and 23% for Yes Car Credit 2008: 21%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within the Consumer Credit Division is 6.2 months 2008: 6.5 months and within Yes Car Credit is nil months 2008: 4.1 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is the higher of 5 or 4.5% of their outstanding balance.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 1.4 billion 2008: 1.3 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
This value approximates to market value.

There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank, Yes Car Credit or in respect of the unsecured direct repayment loans within the Consumer Credit Division which are past due but not impaired.
In the home credit business of the Consumer Credit Division, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate significantly.

In the year ended 31 December 2009, the group entered into various interest rate swaps which have been designated and were effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2009 2008 m m Liability asset at 1 January 20.0 0.7 Credited charged to the hedging reserve 1.2 20.0 Movement in fair value of ineffective interest rate swaps credited charged to the income statement 1.0 0.7 Exceptional finance cost recycling of previously deferred losses note 3 6.8 Liability at 31 December 24.6 20.0 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of average Weighted Range of average average interest period to average interest period to interest rate rates maturity interest rate rates maturity Group % % years % % years Sterling 4.2 3.1-5.2 1.2 4.4 3.25.2 1.9 Euro 3.8 3.8 1.7 3.8 3.8 0.6 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of average Weighted Range of average average interest period to average interest period to interest rate rates maturity interest rate rates maturity Company % % years % % years Sterling 4.2 3.1-5.2 1.2 4.4 3.25.2 1.9 Euro 3.8 3.8 1.7 3.8 3.8 0.6 Provident Financial plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 107 continued 16 Derivative financial instruments continued d Cross-currency swaps The group and company use cross-currency swaps in order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising on the groups US private placement loan notes issued in 2001, 2003 and 2004.
2001 and 2003 private placement loan notes The group and company have put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the 2001 and 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes see note 21 e. These swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 December 2009 and the fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange movements on the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes have a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% 2008: 7.6%, a range of interest rates of 7.6% 2008: 7.6% and a weighted average period to maturity of 1.4 years 2008: 2.4 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group and company 2009 2008 m m Liability at 1 January 0.1 17.1 Exchange rate movements 1.5 16.7 Charged credited to the hedging reserve 0.3 0.3 Liability at 31 December 1.9 0.1 The exchange rate movements reflect the movement in the year of the difference between the translation of the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year end exchange rate compared to the contracted rate.
A corresponding entry is made to borrowings.
The amount charged credited to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the crosscurrency swaps and the exchange rate movements described above.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes have a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% 2008: 6.7%, a range of interest rates of 6.6% to 6.8% 2008: 6.6% to 6.8% and a weighted average period to maturity of 2.2 years 2008: 3.2 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2009 2008 m m Asset liability at 1 January 6.8 16.5 Exchange rate movements 7.7 21.6 Charged credited to the hedging reserve 1.6 1.7 Liability asset at 31 December 2.5 6.8 The exchange rate movements reflect the movement in the year of the difference between the translation of the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year end exchange rate compared to the contracted rate.
2004 private placement loan notes The group has put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the US dollar private placement loan notes issued in 2004 into floating rate sterling interest liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes see note 21 e. The swaps comprise both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.
The cash flow hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges in the year and the movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged credited to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge credit within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss gain on the fair value hedge in the year.
The swaps have a range of interest rates from LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% 2008: LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 3.7 years 2008: 4.7 years.

Provident Financial plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 109 continued 18 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme covers 63% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
Following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements, from 1 April 2006 members were provided with a choice of paying higher member contributions to continue accruing benefits based on final salary or paying a lower member contribution and accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary which would be revalued each year.
The most recent actuarial valuation of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 1June 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
A valuation as at 1 June 2009 is currently in progress but is not yet finalised.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on the preliminary results of the 2009 valuation updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect anticipated long-term real rates of return.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate should be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds and that the term of the instruments chosen should be consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligations.
In the UK, this is usually interpreted to mean the yield on AA-rated corporate bonds of an appropriate term.
A movement of 0.1% in the discount rate would increase or decrease the retirement benefit asset by approximately 9m 2008: 8m.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of selfadministered pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The group now uses the S1PA standard tables as the basis for projecting mortality adjusted for the following factors: A 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females is made in order to reflect lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes: and The projections are combined with the medium cohort improvement factors in order to predict future improvements in life expectancy, subject to an annual minimum rate of improvement of 1%.
In more simple terms, it is now assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 23 years if they are male 2008: 22 years and for a further 25 years if they are female 2008: 25 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for the scheme, the retirement benefit asset would have been reduced by approximately 14m 2008: 10m.
The actual return on scheme assets compared to the expected return is as follows: Group Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Expected return on scheme assets 24.9 29.8 7.9 9.5 Actuarial movement on scheme assets 29.9 78.9 10.6 24.5 Actual return on scheme assets 54.8 49.1 18.5 15.0 Provident Financial plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements 112 Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Retirement benefit asset continued Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group and company.
The pension charge in the consolidated income statement represents contributions payable by the group in respect of the plan and amounted to 3.2m for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 1.5m.
Contributions made by the company amounted to 0.2m 2008: 0.1m.
