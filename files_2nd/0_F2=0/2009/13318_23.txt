Inter group revenue represents trading with other Rentokil Initial business units which is eliminated on consolidation.
IFRS 8, Operating Segments is effective for all accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
It covers the publication of segmental information and is applicable to Rentokil Initial plc for the period ended 31 December 2009.
To comply with the new standard the group has aligned its segmental information, with effect from 1 January 2009, with the new operational organisation structure implemented on 1 July 2008.
As a result the group has restated the 2008 comparative segmental information on the new basis.
Reported segments represent groups of businesses providing similar products and services and are headed by a divisional managing director.
Businesses in Asia Paci c are grouped together under one segment and one divisional managing director.
Central items represent corporate expenses that are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.
A description of the segments is provided on pages 8 and 9.

The main changes result from a change in the internal organisational structure with certain business units now reporting through different divisional structures coupled with some minor changes to the allocation of divisional overheads.
The principal changes are the relocation of the UK Washrooms business and the UK Shared Service Centre to the Facilities Services division, the transfer of the South African business to the Pest Control division and the transfer of the Medical and Specialist Hygiene businesses from Facilities Services to the Textiles and Washroom Services division.
In addition, revenues are now stated gross of inter group trading rather than net and revenues and pro ts are shown at constant exchange rates consistent with our internal reporting and review processes.

Financial statements 61 Notes to the accounts Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identi ed according to country of operation and reportable segment.
A summary of the 2009 goodwill allocation by reportable segment is shown below: North Asia 2009 2008 UK Europe America Pacific Africa Total Total m m m m m m m Textiles and Washroom Services 3.9 73.1 77.0 80.0 Pest Control 15.5 60.2 0.2 75.9 83.4 Asia Pacific 79.9 79.9 84.2 Ambius 2.9 12.9 15.8 17.3 City Link 203.1 203.1 203.1 Facilities Services 18.3 18.3 18.3 31 December 2009 225.3 91.5 73.1 79.9 0.2 470.0 31 December 2008 225.3 95.9 80.7 84.2 0.2 486.3 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash ow projections based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management covering a five-year period which are prepared as part of the groups normal planning process and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 0% and 2% and pre-tax discount rates of between 10% and 13% 2008: 12% and 18%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for speci c risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
During the year an impairment charge of 4.3 million in respect of prior years acquisitions was made.
The charge related to our electronic security businesses and three smaller pest control and washrooms businesses in Asia Paci c. The remaining goodwill balance at 31 December 2009 amounts to 470.0 million with 203.1 million of this relating to the acquisition of the City Link franchises and Target Express in previous years.
The most signi cant assumption surrounding the recoverability of this goodwill balance relates to the future cash ows of the enlarged City Link business and the extent of the success of the initiatives implemented to return this business to pro tability.
The impairment test assumes operating cash in ows in 2014 of some 36 million with future years growing at rates consistent with the longer-term growth rates disclosed above.
These cash ows would need to be approximately 33% below these levels before goodwill is impaired.
The remaining balance of 266.9 million is spread across a number of CGUs and no reasonable change in the key assumptions above would give rise to a signi cant impairment in these businesses.

Any ineffectiveness on the fair value and cash ow hedges are taken directly to finance costs.
The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 3.1 million 2008: loss of 3.4 million note 5.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges or those derivatives in a cash ow hedge relationship.
The group has 300 million xed to oating LIBOR plus spread interest rate swaps for which fair value hedge accounting was applied and whose critical terms match those of the bonds disclosed in note 21.
On 1 April 2009, the group entered into a set of 300 million oating LIBOR plus spread to xed interest rate swaps whose critical terms matched those of the original 300 million xed to oating interest rate swap.
At this date the fair value hedge was revoked and both interest rate swaps are non-hedge accounted.
Upon ceasing hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment attributable to the risk being hedged is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the bond.
The group has 75 million and 50 million oating LIBOR plus spread to xed interest rate swaps for which cash ow hedge accounting is applied and whose critical terms match those of the bonds disclosed in note 21.
A charge of 3.6 million 2008: nil has been recognised in reserves during the year in respect of the interest rate swaps which are cash ow hedge accounted.
66 Financial statements Notes to the accounts The group has outstanding forward rate agreements maturing in between three to six months with nominal values of 200 million 2008: 464.7 million attracting an average xed interest rate of 2.05%.
These forward rate agreements are cash ow hedge accounted.
A charge of 1.4 million 2008: 4.2 million has been recognised in reserves during the year in respect of the forward rate agreements which are cash ow hedge accounted and a 4.2 million 2008: nil charge recognised in reserves in prior periods has been recycled to the income statement in the year.
The effective nominal value of foreign exchange swaps is 516.6 million 2008: 1,009.0 million and foreign exchange forwards is 30.7 million 2008: nil.
Fair value hierarchy of derivative financial instruments For all financial instruments held by the group, those that are held at fair value are to be classi ed by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following hierarchy is used: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices: Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The group holds all derivatives at fair value using discounted cash ow valuation models based on market rates which are observable.
Therefore all derivative financial instruments held at fair value by the group fall into Level 2.
No financial instruments have moved between levels in the year.

Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next ten years.
Self-insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks.
The group has historically self-insured its risks but during the latter part of 2008, other than for third party motor liability and workers compensation in the USA and the global property damage business interruption, this practice was stopped and these became fully covered in the insurance market.
Provision is still held for self-insured past cover.
For the continuing self-insured programmes, individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses together with amounts set aside to cover certain legal and regulatory claims.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next five years.
The above provisions have been discounted where appropriate using a discount rate of 1.9% 2008: 3.0% for the UK, 3.0% 2008: 3.0% for Europe and 3.8% 2008: 2.1% for the USA.

In September 2008, 75 million was raised through the issue of 25-year Floating Rate Reset Notes.
From the date of the issue until August 2013 the Reset Notes will bear interest at three-month LIBOR 3.98%.
Thereafter the interest rate will be 4.55% plus a credit spread which will be reset every two years by auction.
In October 2008, 50 million was raised through the issue of Floating Rate Notes due 2013.
In June 2009, oating to xed interest rate swaps were entered into on the 75 million and 50 million oating rate notes that are designated in a cash ow hedge.
Floating rate loans bear interest at rates, based on the relevant national borrowing rate benchmark equivalents e. g. LIBOR, which are xed in advance usually for periods of between one and twelve months.
Floating rate exposure is managed using forward rate agreements which all mature within one year as disclosed in note 16.
Other borrowings represent bank loans and overdrafts and are held at amortised cost.
Any ineffectiveness on the fair value and cash ow hedges is taken directly to finance costs.
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, all the notes and related derivatives have been marked as NH non-hedge and any changes are taken to finance costs.

Net investment hedging The group has designated a portion of the 500 million bond as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge of its subsidiaries in the eurozone along with foreign currency swaps with a notional value of 200 million.
The carrying value of the euro note at 31 December 2009 was 453.3 million 2008: 487.7 million.
The group has foreign currency swaps which were entered into in 2008 to manage currency debt exposure.
These swaps achieve hedge accounting and are accounted for as net investment hedges.
They had a fair value loss as at 31 December 2009 of 0.8 million 2008: 0.3 million gain with a maturity of between one and four months.
The foreign exchange gain of 30.6 million 2008: 103.2 million loss on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.

Foreign currency risk The group uses debt denominated in foreign currencies to provide either a natural offset in the income statement of the translation of foreign currency assets or to designate borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements as net investment hedges of the foreign currency assets of subsidiaries, with translation gains or losses taken to equity.
Similarly, the groups businesses do not undertake signi cant cross-border trade and therefore are not subject to signi cant foreign currency transaction risk.
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities including letters of credit of 22.6 million 2008: 45.7 million available at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 in respect of which all continuing conditions precedent had been met at that date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Retirement bene t obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes are of the fide ned bene t type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the United Kingdom, which has a number of fide ned bene t sections which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No 2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
The most recent full valuation was at 31 March 2007.
These fide ned bene t schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2009 2008 Weighted average % Discount rate 5.7% 6.4% Expected return on plan assets 6.0% 6.0% Future salary increases 4.5% 3.7% Future pension increases 3.5% 2.9% Financial statements 75 Notes to the accounts The expected return on plan assets in the above table is a long-term rate of return.
Assets with higher historic volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected return for each asset class over the benchmark asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2009, less an appropriate allowance for the cost of maintaining the swap portfolio.
Mortality assumptions At 31 December 2009, standard tables PNMA00 and PNFA00 projected based on the year of the members birth using the PA92 series Medium Cohort projection factors incorporating underpins to annual improvements in mortality rates of 1.0% for males and 0.5% for females.
The mortality rates are scaled by a factor of 130% for non-executive members and by 85% for executive members.
This equates to a man aged 65 living for a further 20.1 years if he is a non-executive member and for a further 23.6 years if he is an executive member.
The corresponding gures for a woman are 22.2 and 25.5 years respectively.
The same assumptions were adopted at 31 December 2008.

Share-based payments The company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Share options are equity settled.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
There are two levels of quali cation under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applies to all senior executives including executive directors, Level 2 and deferred share schemes apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
They are summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of in ation.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of in ation.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a fide ned group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in the group of support services companies.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: Weighted average Number exercise of share price options p per share 000 Outstanding at 1 January 2008 202.825 24,825 Expired 216.409 12,018 Outstanding at 31 December 2008 190.078 12,807 Expired 189.407 5,565 Outstanding at 31 December 2009 190.593 7,242 No options were exercised during the period.

78 Financial statements Notes to the accounts Performance Share Plan The company introduced a new share based Performance Plan in 2006 and granted 9,521,516 shares in May 2006, 10,173,589 at various dates throughout 2007, 10,245,358 at various dates throughout 2008 and 11,703,753 at various dates throughout 2009.
The 2006 grants lapsed at the end of 2009 with the performance criteria not being met.
For 75% of the TSR portion of an award, performance is measured by comparing the companys relative TSR performance to that of constituents of the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies.
For the remaining 25% of the TSR portion of an award, the companys TSR performance is measured against the constituents of an international group of support services companies.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The 2006 grants lapsed at the end of 2009.
The performance conditions for the 2008 awards are share price and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The share price condition is based on the highest average share price of Rentokil Initial plc over any 60 consecutive dealing days during the initial three-year period.
The performance period for the share price element of the award began on 1 April 2008 and ends 61 dealing days following the announcement of the companys results for the financial year ending 31 December 2010.
The annual bonus multiplier measures the extent to which the annual bonus targets have been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2008 awards in the above table assume an on target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
No shares will vest if the share price does not reach 120p per share at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the share price reaches 180p per share and all participants attain maximum of their bonus targets.
The performance conditions for the 2009 awards are total shareholder return TSR and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The TSR condition is measured relative to the TSR achieved by constituents of a comparator group, made up of the FTSE 350 companies at the date of grant but excluding financial services and basic resources companies.
The performance period for the share price element of the award began on 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2012.
The TSR performance is measured using a three-month average with the start period average being 1 January 2009 to 31 March 2009 and the end period average being 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2012.
The 2009 awards in the above table assume a TSR performance in the upper quartile or above is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
No shares will vest if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain maximum bonus targets.
Financial statements 79 Notes to the accounts The fair value of the 2009 awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a model developed by Deloitte LLP.
This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
The signi cant inputs into the model were a share price of 88.5p, an expected share price volatility of 31.2%, a share price correlation of the companies in the comparator group of 28% and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
Given the signi cant volatility of share prices observed over an historic period, an average three-year volatility gure over the three years to the date of grant has been used to determine the historic long-term trend, and this has been taken as a benchmark for the expected share price volatility over the term of the awards.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to re ect dividends paid during the vesting period.
Executive Share Plan In 2008, the company also introduced a long-term incentive plan for the chairman, chief executive and one other executive director and granted 22,500,000 shares during the year.
Number Number Exercise 31 December 31 December Year of Grant period 2008 Granted Lapsed 2009 2008 20112013 22,500,000 22,500,000 The performance condition for the award is share price and will only be satis ed if the share price target is achieved over a sustained period, demonstrating realisable value creation for shareholders.
This will be measured on the basis of an average share price over any 60 consecutive trading days during the performance measurement period.
Until a minimum share price of 120p per share has been met over a sustained period, no shares will be earned.
At 120p per share, 20% of the award would be earned, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting at a share price of 180p per share.
For achieving growth in market value between a share price of 180p per share and 280p per share further shares may be earned up to a maximum of a further 50% of the original award.
The 2008 awards in the same table assume an on 1 3 target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period.
Up to of the award may vest following the end of the 1 1 3 3 third year, another following the end of the fourth year and a further following the end of the fifth year, based on the extent to which performance targets are achieved.
Any unvested portion of the award following the end of the fifth year will lapse.
See the Remuneration report on pages 32 to 38 for further details.
The fair value of the 2008 awards made under the Rentokil Initial 2008 Share Incentive Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation model.
The signi cant inputs into the model were a share price of 102p, an expected share price volatility of 21%, an expected dividend yield of 5% per annum and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices measured until October 2007 therefore excluding the signi cant volatility during the last months of 2007, which the company would not expect going forward.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 5.1 million 2008: 2.6 million.
