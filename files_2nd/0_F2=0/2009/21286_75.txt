26 VAT on management fees In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should be charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgement on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then, HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies.
