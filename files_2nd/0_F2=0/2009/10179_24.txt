Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 december 2009 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies statement of compliance Michael Page International plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the companies Act.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with current International Financial reporting Standards IFrS.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFrS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of Michael Page International plc consolidate the results of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by Section 408 of the companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the company has not been included as part of these financial statements.
The companys profit for the financial year amounted to 73.6m 2008: 320.1m.
The decrease in the companys profit this year is as a result of decreased dividend income.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
refer to page 18 for further details.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company.
control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragr oup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
iii Employee Benefit Trust In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts, shares in Michael Page International plc held by the trust are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the group.
The policies, set out below, have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
new standards and interpretations The accounting policies applied by the group in these consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those applied by the group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2008 except as described below.
In the current financial year, the group has adopted International Accounting Standard 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007 IAS 1 and International Financial reporting Standard 8 Operating Segments IFrS 8.
The implementation of IAS 1 revised 2007 resulted in changes to disclosure with the inclusion of a consolidated Statement of comprehensive Income.
IFrS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment reporting required the group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and rewards approach, with the groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
Information reported to the groups chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on regions and, as such, the implementation of IFrS 8 resulted in no significant changes, as disclosures over and above those required by IAS 14 were previously made.
58 MIchAEl PAgE InTErnATIOnAl 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued new standards and interpretations continued The amendments to IFrS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk.
The group has elected not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance with the transitional reliefs offered in these amendments.
IFrS 2 Share-based Payment Vesting conditions and cancellations has been amended to clarify the definition of vesting conditions.
The concept of non-vesting conditions has been introduced and the accounting treatment for cancellations was clarified.
These amendments have not resulted in significant changes.
Below is a summary of other new and revised Standards and Interpretations that have been adopted in the current year, where their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements, but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
Amendment to IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance IAS 20 has been amended to require that the benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest to be treated as a government grant.
This accounting treatment was not permitted prior to this amendment.
IAS 23 revised 2007 Borrowing Costs The principal change to the Standard was to eliminate the option to expense all borrowing costs when incurred.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation The revisions to IAS 32 amend the criteria for debt equity classification by permitting certain puttable financial instruments and instruments or components of instruments that impose on an entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rate share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation, to be classified as equity, subject to specified criteria being met.
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge accounting: identifying inflation as a hedged risk or portion, and hedging with options.
Embedded Derivatives Amendments to IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The amendments clarify the accounting for embedded derivatives in the case of a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss FVTPl category as permitted by the October 2008 amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and Measurement see above.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation The Interpretation provides guidance on the detailed requirements for net investment hedging for certain hedge accounting designations.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers adopted for transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009 The Interpretation addresses the accounting by recipients for transfers of property, plant and equipment from customers and concludes what item of property, plant and equipment transferred meets the definition of an asset from the perspective of the recipient, the recipient should recognise the asset at its fair value on the date of transfer, with the credit recognised in accordance with IAS 18 revenue.
AnnUAl rEPOrT 2009 59 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued new standards and interpretations continued At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations impacting the group, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue, but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFrS 3 revised 2008 Business combinations IAS 27 revised 2008 consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised 2008 Investments in Associates IFrIc 17 Distributions of non-cash Assets to Owners Improvements to IFrSs April 2009 The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the above Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have little or no impact on the financial statements of the group when the relevant Standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010. going concern The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Business review on page 18. a revenue and income recognition revenue, which excludes value added tax VAT, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the group from its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
These consist of: revenue from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff, including the salary cost of these staff.
This is recognised when the service has been provided: revenue from permanent placements is based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of defined stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate and where a start date has been determined.
The latter includes revenue anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within prepayments and accrued income.
A provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and revenue from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
b Cost of sales cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.
c gross profit gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and consists of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and the margin on advertising income.
d Foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the companys functional and presentation currency.
60 MIchAEl PAgE InTErnATIOnAl 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued d Foreign currency translation continued ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all the group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
e intangible assets i Goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy h. gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
ii Computer software computer software acquired by the group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below.
Included with computer software, are assets under construction which are amortised from the point they go live.
iii Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
goodwill has an indefinite useful life.
computer software is amortised at 20% per annum.
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 is 311.7m 2008: 311.7m.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10-20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum g investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
AnnUAl rEPOrT 2009 61 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued h impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events has had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
i taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
62 MIchAEl PAgE InTErnATIOnAl 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued j Pension costs The group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable by the group to the funds during each period.
k leased assets leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the income statement.
leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classed as operating leases.
rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l segment reporting IFrS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Information provided to the chief Executive is focused on regions and as a result, reportable segments are on a regional basis.
m dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the companys shareholders.
n share-based compensation The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
Their accounting treatments are described below: i Share option schemes The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings per share.
non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised.
The group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
ii Deferred Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans Where deferred awards are made to Directors and senior executives under either the Incentive Share Plan or the Annual Bonus Scheme, to reflect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates.
o repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
AnnUAl rEPOrT 2009 63 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued p Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
q Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are accrued in the income statement on a time basis.
r Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
cash and cash equivalents includes cash-in-hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
The group has derivative contracts at the balance sheet date that have been valued at fair value through the income statement.
s Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFrS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the companys accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management anticipate that any estimates and judgements made do not have a material effect on the results.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: Note 1 revenue recognition In making its judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from permanent placements where a position has been accepted by a candidate, a start date agreed, but employment has not yet commenced.
A provision is made by management, based on past historical experience, for the proportion of those placements where the candidate is expected to reverse their acceptance prior to the start date.
64 MIchAEl PAgE InTErnATIOnAl 1. siGNiFiCaNT aCCouNTiNG PoliCies CoNTiNued s Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Note 13 trade and other receivables In the current economic climate, there is increased uncertainty regarding customers who may not be able to pay as their invoices fall due.
In reviewing the appropriateness of the provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables, consideration has been given to the ageing of the debt and the potential likelihood of default, taking into account current economic conditions.
Note 14 trade and other payables In 2003 Michael Page submitted an initial claim to hMrc for overpaid VAT which was rejected.
Michael Page appealed and subsequently filed amended claims for 26.5m, net of fees, covering the period from 1980 to 2004.
In March 2009, Michael Page filed amended claims for a further refund of an additional 80m, net of fees, of overpaid VAT covering the same period.
In June 2009 Michael Page received a payment from hMrc of 26.5m, net of fees, as part settlement of these claims and in July 2009 received 10.9m, net of fees, of statutory interest.
On 25 September, Michael Page received a letter from hMrc which stated that, hMrc have reviewed the recent payment and are now of the view that the claim in whole or in part should not have been paid.
A number of discussions and meetings with hMrc have since taken place and in respect of the initial claim, subject to legal contract, an agreement has now been reached in principle for Michael Page to retain 28.5 million net of fees of the 37.4 million it received.
however, given the background to the initial receipt and the subsequent review and reversal of its decision by hMrc, the group has not recognised any amount in the Income Statement due to the remaining uncertainty pending formal contractual agreement.
Note 16 deferred tax Management has estimated the likely value of deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses carried forward.
Note 17 called-up share capital The groups policy for share-based payments is stated in note 1 n. The fair value of equity settled share-based payments is partly derived from estimates of factors such as lapse rates and achievement of performance criteria.
It is also derived from assumptions such as the future volatility of the companys share price, expected dividend yields and risk-free interest rates.
2. seGmeNT rePorTiNG All revenues disclosed are derived from external customers.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in note 1.
Segment operating profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of central administration costs and certain recharges.
This is the measure reported to the groups chief Executive for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
AnnUAl rEPOrT 2009 65 2. seGmeNT rePorTiNG CoNTiNued The analysis below is of the carrying amount of reportable segment assets, liabilities and non-current assets.
Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The individual reportable segments exclude income tax assets and liabilities.
non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, computer software and goodwill.

The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2008 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year.
The proposed final dividend of 5.12p per ordinary share will be paid on 7 June 2010 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7 May 2010, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
AnnUAl rEPOrT 2009 69 9. earNiNGs Per ordiNary share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2009 2008 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 12,430 97,339 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 321,643 321,475 Dilution effect of share plans 000 7,412 4,178 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 329,055 325,653 Basic earnings per share pence 3.9 30.3 Diluted earnings per share pence 3.8 29.9 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and held in the reserve.
diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.
Potential future ordinary share transactions It remains the companys intention to use surplus cash to repurchase and cancel its shares.
A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
2009 2008 000 000 UK 1,274 1,274 USA 214 214 Singapore 51 51 1,539 1,539 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget, management projections for five years, followed by an assumed growth rate of 3%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets and reflects long-term wage inflation fee growth.
Management applied a discount rate of 10% to the estimated future cash flows to calculate the terminal value of those cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2009 there was no impairment of intangible assets.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2009 2008 000 000 Deferred tax assets 10,179 6,496 Deferred tax liabilities 327 897 9,852 5,599 At 31 December 2009, unremitted earnings of overseas group companies amounted to 52.2m 2008: 104.6m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas tax, but should not be liable to UK tax if they were to be distributed as dividends.
certain of the groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 5.5m 2008: 1.4m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
All of the deferred tax asset for losses of 3.0m is dependent on generating future taxable profits.
Of the recognised deferred tax asset, 2.3m is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.
Called-uP share CaPiTal CoNTiNued share option Plans The group currently has share option awards outstanding under an Executive share option scheme ESOS and a share option scheme SOS.
These plans are described below.
At 31 December 2009 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the companys ordinary shares of 1p under both the Michael Page Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Option Scheme.
All options granted are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Share options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of the grant.
Two grants under the ESOS were made before 7 november 2002.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFrS 2 have been applied to all grants after 7 november 2002.
They have not been applied to the two grants made prior to 7 november 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFrS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial reporting Standards and IFrS 2 Share-based Payment.
no awards were made under the ESOS scheme in 2009.
Called-uP share CaPiTal CoNTiNued esos plan details Note 1 Pre flotation options On flotation, options over 33,750,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the Executive Directors and 427 employees.
An individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satisfied over a period of at least 3 years.
none of these options will vest unless the companys share price has achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
At that point one third of this portion of the options vest.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 200% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
These hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.45% and 24.57% respectively.
At 31 December 2009, the performance conditions were met for 81.8% 2008: 81.8% of the outstanding share price dependent options.
At 31 December 2009, 18.2% of the options remained unvested 2008: 18.2%.
In order for these remaining options to have vested by 31 December 2009 a share price of 10.96 2008: 9.64 would have been required.
At this stage it is not expected that the remaining 18.2% of options will vest prior to the awards lapsing on 30 March 2011.
Note 2 Grants post flotation For grants since 2004, the performance condition is tested on the third anniversary and no retesting will occur thereafter.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK retail Price Index.
The respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table on page 77. share option scheme sos Note 3 Executive Directors of the company are not eligible to participate in this scheme.
Any exercises of awards made under this plan must be settled by market purchased shares.
This new scheme was created in 2009 to provide an effective plan under which to grant awards in 2009.
It was the Boards view that grants made under the existing ESOS plan, which would have required an increase over the 2008 base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK retail Price Index by 2011, would be achievable due to the impact of the global downturn on the groups EPS and thus would not provide the required retention incentive.
The 2009 grant made under the SOS plan is subject to a performance condition that will be tested, initially, three years after the date of grant and then annually until either the entire grant has vested, or ten years from the date of the award have elapsed, in which case any awards outstanding under the grant will lapse.
The performance condition is directly linked to the groups Operating Profit.
If Operating Profit is 30m then 30% of the award would vest.
For every 1m of Operating Profit over 30m, a further 1% would vest.
100% of the award would vest if Operating Profit was 100m.
Called-uP share CaPiTal CoNTiNued share option valuation and measurement In 2009, options were granted on 9 March with the estimated fair values of the options granted on that day of 0.76.
In 2008, options were granted on 6 March.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on that date was 1.17.
Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants other than those on the initial grant in 2001.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 have an exercise price in the range of 81.5 pence to 494.1 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 6.2 years.
The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Plans Incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Share price 1.88 2.85 1.88 2.85 1.88 2.85 Average exercise price 1.91 2.85 Nil Nil Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 0.76 1.17 1.88 2.80 1.88 2.80 Expected volatility 63% 52% 63% 52% 63% 52% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 2 years 2 years Risk free rate 2.19% 5.25% 2.04% 5.25% 1.46% 5.25% Expected dividend yield 4.27% 2.81% Nil Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the companys share price since flotation.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The group recognised total expenses of 8.5m 2008: 6.7m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
other share-based payment plans The company also operates an Incentive Share Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and an Annual Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages 42 to 44, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
18. reserves share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the companys own shares.
There was no movement in the year as any shares repurchased were purchased into the employee benefit trust rather than cancelled.
reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust At 31 December 2009, the reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust consisted of 5,925,597 ordinary shares 2008: 7,010,335 ordinary shares held for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the Incentive Share Plan and deferred shares under the Annual Bonus Plan, representing 1.8% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 22.5m 2008: 15.1m.
AnnUAl rEPOrT 2009 79 18. reserves CoNTiNued reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust continued A total of 4,370,402 shares have been allocated to satisfy share awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, and 881,787 deferred shares have been allocated under the Annual Bonus Plan.
Dividends are paid on these shares and they are included in the EPS calculation.
Following the allocation of awards made under the above mentioned plans, to date 673,408 ordinary shares remain unallocated in the reserve.
Dividends on these shares are waived and are treated as non dilutive.
Currency translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations that are integral to the operations of the company.

currently the main Eurozone subsidiaries and the UK-based group Treasury subsidiary participate in this cash pool, although it is the groups intention to extend the scope of the participation to other group companies going forward.
The structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
This notional pooling does not meet the strict set-off rules under IFrS and as a result the cash and bank overdraft balances have been reported gross on the balance sheet.
On a netted pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents and overdraft balances would have been 43k lower, resulting in 137.2m cash and cash equivalents and nil bank overdraft balances.
Within cash generated from operations is a net balance of 41.0m relating to a VAT refund by hMrc see note 14.
FiNaNCial risk maNaGemeNT The group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: i credit risk ii liquidity risk iii market risk This note presents information about the groups exposure to each of the above risks, the groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the groups risk management framework.
The groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group Audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the group.
The group Audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit committee.
i Credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the groups receivables from clients and investment securities.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
trade and other receivables Total trade receivables net of allowances held by the group at 31 December 2009 amounted to 100.2m 2008: 168.4m.
An initial credit period is made available on invoices.
no interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
The group has provided fully for all receivables over 150 days because historical experience is such that receivables past due beyond 150 days are generally not recoverable.
Trade receivables below 150 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 37.4m 2008: 77.0m that are past due at the reporting date for which the group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 40 days in excess of the initial credit period 2008: 56 days.
FiNaNCial risk maNaGemeNT CoNTiNued trade and other receivables continued The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross trade Gross trade Provision receivables Provision receivables 2008 2008 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 Not past due 62,942 167 91,600 272 Past due 0-30 days 27,880 85 48,883 233 Past due 31-150 days 11,466 1,839 30,414 2,023 More than 150 days 4,868 4,868 5,180 5,180 107,156 6,959 176,077 7,708 The groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client.
The demographics of the groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk.
less than 2% of the groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
The geographic diversification of the groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the groups clients have been transacting with the group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.

The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.

The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 13.
ii liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the group from retained earnings.
cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from group cash resources, group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buy back the companys shares.
The group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.

FiNaNCial risk maNaGemeNT CoNTiNued iii market risk and sensitivity analysis The groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
however, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in Pounds Sterling against the groups main exposure currencies is shown on page 85.
There has been no material change in the groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
For additional information on market risk, refer to Treasury management and currency risk in the Business review.
interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The group does not consider this risk as significant.
The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national lIBOr equivalents.
The average interest rate paid on bank overdrafts was 2.4% 2008: 6.0%.
Currency rate risk We publish our results in Pounds Sterling and conduct our business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of our subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of our foreign subsidiaries.
The main functional currencies of the group are Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.
The group does not have material transactional currency exposures, nor is there a material exposure to foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
In certain cases, where the group gives or receives short-term loans to and from other group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange swap derivative financial instruments to manage the currency and interest rate exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.
Contract amounts Derivatives at fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 Derivatives Financial Instruments m m m m Derivative Assets 10.0 15.1 10.0 16.1 Derivative Liabilities 10.0 15.1 10.1 15.6 sensitivity analysis - currency risk A 10 percent strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown on page 85.
This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2008.
