Retirement benefit schemes 70 Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 27.7m 2008: 17.9m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2009 or 2008 for the defined benefit schemes.
11.9m 2008: 12.2m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2009.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP which is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme.
In the US, the Carleton Technologies defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members from 13 December 2003.
Special contributions of 5.5m were paid in 2009 2008: 6.3m to the CPP as agreed in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which completed in 2005.
Actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries, the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2009.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2009.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
com | Group financial statements For the purposes of IAS 19, the principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2009 2008 UK Schemes US Scheme UK Schemes US Scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 4.13% 4.13% 3.50% 3.50% Discount rate 5.66% 5.91% 6.30% 6.30% Inflation assumption 3.63% 3.63% 3.00% 3.00% Expected return on scheme assets 6.65% 7.06% 5.82% 6.42% Pensions increase unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.63% n a 3.00% n a The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experiences of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality assumption used in 2009 and 2008 is denoted by actuaries as PA92 year of birth projections long cohort.
In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life expectancy Year of birth Year age 65 Male 1944 2009 23.7 years Male 1980 2045 25.4 years At 31 December 2009 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2008: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2008: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2008: 80% of eligible members on retirement.
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions is provided below: increasing the discount rate by 0.1% would decrease scheme liabilities by 9.5m: increasing the inflation rate by 0.1% would increase scheme liabilities by 6.4m: if each scheme member was expected to live for an additional year then scheme liabilities would increase by 11.0m.
71 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes are as follows: m 2009 2008 Present value of funded obligations 561.3 458.4 Fair value of scheme assets 446.1 407.2 Net liability 115.2 51.2 The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$22.8m 2008: US$19.8m and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme is US$16.1m 2008: US$13.6m.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
Amounts recognised in operating profit in respect of the defined benefit schemes are as follows: m 2009 2008 Current service cost included in administrative expenses 4.1 5.2 Past service cost included in administrative expenses Amounts credited charged to other finance income expense: m Note 2009 2008 Expected return on pension scheme assets 3 23.7 28.1 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 3 28.5 26.5 Net return 4.8 1.6 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Amount recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income: m 2009 2008 Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 13.8 49.2 Experience losses arising on scheme liabilities 1.8 5.5 Changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities 88.1 27.5 Actuarial loss recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 72.5 27.2 The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since transition to IFRS is 141.8m loss 2008: 69.3m loss.
Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year for changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities, approximately 53.0m related to the decrease in the discount rate with the remainder primarily due to the increase in the inflation assumption.
The actual return on scheme assets was 37.5m gain 2008: loss 21.1m.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are as follows: m 2009 2008 Opening defined benefit obligations 458.4 457.7 Current service cost 4.1 5.2 Interest cost 28.5 26.5 Actuarial loss gain 86.3 22.0 Contributions by members 3.0 2.2 NI rebates 0.7 1.3 Exchange differences 1.8 3.6 Benefits paid 17.9 16.1 72 Closing defined benefit obligations 561.3 458.4 Changes in the fair value of scheme assets are as follows: m 2009 2008 Opening fair value of scheme assets 407.2 420.5 Expected return 23.7 28.1 Actuarial gain loss 13.8 49.2 Contributions by members 3.0 2.2 NI rebates 0.7 1.3 Contributions by employers 11.3 11.2 Special contributions 5.5 6.3 Exchange differences 1.2 2.9 Benefits paid 17.9 16.1 Closing fair value of scheme assets 446.1 407.2 Including further special contributions, the Group expects to contribute 24.7m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2010.
com | Group financial statements The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices published by, for example, the London Stock Exchange.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolio.
The history of the scheme for the current and previous four periods is as follows: m 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Present value of defined benefit obligations 561.3 458.4 457.7 447.8 451.3 Fair value of scheme assets 446.1 407.2 420.5 418.2 370.3 Deficit 115.2 51.2 37.2 29.6 81.0 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities 1.8 5.5 0.3 0.8 9.9 Experience adjustments on scheme assets 13.8 49.2 31.2 13.2 33.1 Other retirement benefit schemes A number of the Groups subsidiaries based in France contribute to a retirement indemnity scheme.
The liabilities of the scheme were valued by an independent actuary as at 31 December 2008 at 2.9m and are recorded in these financial statements at 2.6m 2008: 2.8m.
These liabilities are included in other liabilities in note 21.
The actuarial loss for the year to 31 December 2008 as recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was 0.8m.
Share-based payments The total expense for share-based payments is as follows: m 2009 2008 Equity settled share-based payment schemes 5.8 6.1 Acquisition related cash settled share-based payments 4.1 3.1 73 Total share-based payment expense 9.9 9.2 Details of the schemes which give rise to these charges are as follows: Equity settled share-based payment schemes The Group operates a number of incentive schemes for certain senior executives as follows: The Cobham Performance Share Plan PSP : The Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS : and The Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan BCP.
The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares which vest 50% based on the Groups three-year Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Groups underlying EPS over the same period.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three-year period.
The scheme also includes a time-only section which is offered to participants based in the US.
This allows for options to be granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
The BCP scheme allows participants to defer up to 50% of their net earned annual performance bonus into Cobham shares in return for an opportunity to earn up to a 2:1 matching award of shares, based on three-year Economic Profit growth targets.
A number of awards were made under the Cobham Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP up to 2006 and the final award under this scheme has vested during 2009.
These awards were made at nil cost, vesting over a three-year performance period based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over the same period.
Further details of the above schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 43 and 44.
Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued In addition, entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave is available to all employees of participating UK subsidiaries.
Employees may purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a two-week period each year, up to a maximum contribution value of 3,000 in any one year.
The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employees share savings plan and will only be released to employees who remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.
The rules of the scheme allow for a matched award based on the gross amount of the bonus, dependent upon satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The exact amount of the entitlement will be ascertained upon vesting of the awards.
Under the LTIP, ESOS and ShareSave schemes, exercises were made at various times throughout the year.

The figures stated above have been restated following a reassessment of the fair values of these awards taking into account the impact of non-vesting conditions as required by IFRS 2 amended.
Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued The fair values in the table above were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model modified by a Monte Carlo simulation for PSP awards to determine the likely impact of market related performance conditions.
The inputs into the model were as follows: PSP BCP ESOS ShareSave 2009 Weighted average share price 1.838 2.060 1.788 1.829 Weighted average exercise price nil nil 1.841 1.730 Expected volatility 18% 26% 28% 24%-26% Expected life 3 years 3 years 5 years 3-7 years Expected employee cancellation rate 2.0% 2.2% Risk free rate 2.9% 4.0% 2.7% 3.8% Expected dividend yield n a 2.1% 2.8% 2.5% 2008 Weighted average share price 2.199 2.210 2.205 1.950 Weighted average exercise price nil nil 2.016 1.630 Expected volatility 27% 25% 24% 24%-26% Expected life 3 years 3 years 5 years 3-7 years Expected employee cancellation rate 2.2% Risk free rate 4.4% 4.4% 4.3% 4.5% Expected dividend yield n a 2.0% 2.0% 1.9% Expected volatility was determined through the assessment of the historical volatility over a period consistent with the expected life of the award.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rate is based on an assessment of historic rates of voluntary 76 cancellations of ShareSave contracts by employees.
Participants of the PSP scheme receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuation model.
Cash settled share-based payment schemes During 2006 and 2007, the Group issued share appreciation rights SARs and awards under a phantom LTIP scheme to certain senior executives that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee at the date of exercise.
These awards vested during 2009 and no further awards have been made under these schemes.
The expense for the year for the SAR and phantom LTIP rights is based on the fair value of the outstanding liability at the balance sheet date of 0.4m at 31 December 2009 2008: 0.4m, together with any additional amounts arising at the date of exercise.
SARs were granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the rights were granted.
As with the ESOS awards, exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three-year period and is possible between three and five years after grant.
Phantom LTIP awards were made at nil cost, vesting over a three-year performance period based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over the same period.
The comparator group and conditions are the same as those which apply for LTIPs.

Acquisition related share-based payments The agreement for the acquisition of SPARTA Inc now trading as Cobham Analytic Solutions by Cobham in 2008 provided for unvested equitysettled options held by employees of SPARTA at the date of acquisition to be replaced with cash-settled option rights.
These were issued on 3 June 2008 and vest over a maximum of three years, based on the vesting date of the original options.
The new awards are conditional only upon an employees continued employment to the vesting date.
The average exercise price based on the original options of each new right granted is 1.160 and the latest vesting date is 9 January 2011.
The rights vest at a price linked to the market price of Cobham plcs shares with a minimum value at the date of vesting, based on the market value of Cobham plc shares on 3 June 2008, of 2.0925.
A portion of the fair value of the rights at the date of issue associated with pre-acquisition service was allocated to the cost of acquisition and, at the balance sheet date, the liability for this element is included within contingent consideration shown in note 22.
Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued The fair value of the total outstanding liability for these cash-settled awards at 31 December 2009 was 4.9m 2008: 8.2m, of which the majority is reflected within contingent consideration.
The total expense for the year impacting the income statement is 4.1m 2008: 3.1m and this is included within acquisition related adjustments and excluded from underlying earnings as described in note 7.

Technology based assets represents the cost of trade secrets and processes, patented and unpatented technology and know how held by the acquired businesses at the date of acquisition, together with purchased technology assets.
Other intangible assets represent purchased and acquired patents, licences and trademarks, software rights and licences and the order backlog of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition.
All of these assets are initially recognised at cost and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
The fair values of acquired intangible assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets, discounted to present value at a post-tax rate of 7.6% 2008: 7.6%.

81 During 2009 the contingent consideration in respect of the purchase of Patriot Antenna Systems was reassessed, resulting in the generation of negative goodwill which has been written back to the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Additionally during the year, the carrying value of intangible assets which arose on the acquisition of Patriot Antenna Systems was reassessed and additional amortisation of 2.6m was charged to the income statement.
This is included within the amortisation charge for the year as shown in note 13.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to approximately 40 cash generating units CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
For both the current and comparative years there have been no such exceptions.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The Group annually prepares cash flow forecasts for the following five years and this is approved by management for the coming year.
The growth rate assumed after this five year period is based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The long term projections used are in the range 2.5% to 3.0%.
The growth rates assume that demand for our products in the US and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment in the long term future.
Taking into account our expectation of future market conditions we believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.6% 2008: 10.6%.
Following detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the period.
The goodwill allocated to each of Cobham Analytic Solutions SPARTA, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale Lansdale are considered to be individually significant as they represent more than 10% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value.
After translation using year end foreign exchange rates, these CGUs have 130.5m, 91.7m and 73.6m of goodwill respectively, representing 41.1% of the total balance.
Within the remaining 423.5m there are no other amounts considered individually significant.
Cobham Analytic Solutions, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale are all within the Cobham Defence Systems Division and they all operate primarily in the US defence market.
Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued The recoverable amounts associated with these goodwill balances have been determined on a value in use basis.
A value in use test requires comparison of asset carrying values where some intangible asset values arising on acquisitions have been grossed up for hypothetical tax benefits with pre-tax cash flows which exclude any tax benefit.
Furthermore, the value in use test ignores the related deferred tax liabilities which IFRS prevents from being included in any value in use calculation.
Key assumptions and sensitivities are as follows: The five year plans for these companies have been extrapolated in perpetuity using a long term US GDP growth rate of 3.0% and discounted using the Groups discount rate.
A key assumption in deriving the growth rate is that market demand in the products and services provided by Cobham Analytic Solutions, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale grow broadly in line with the underlying economic environment for the foreseeable future.
The businesses would need to contract by more than 2.4% each year in order for any of their carrying values to be impaired.
Sensitivity analysis has determined that the discount rate of 10.6% is an influential assumption on the outcome of the recoverable amount calculation.
The recoverable amounts of Cobham Analytic Solutions, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale exceed the total carrying value of assets for the CGU by US$155.8m, US$141.9m and US$80.9m respectively: the discount rate would need to increase to 14.9%, 15.5% and 14.1% for Cobham Analytic Solutions, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale respectively in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
Sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the operating cash flow projections.
Cash flows can be impacted by changes to sales projections, sales prices and direct costs.
In order for the carrying value of goodwill for Cobham Analytic Solutions, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale to be impaired the expected cash flows for every year would need to reduce by 39%, 42% and 34% respectively.
The cash flow projections within the value in use calculations include an allocation of central overheads.
If these were excluded then the discount rate would need to increase to 17.2%, 16.7% and 15.4% for Cobham Analytic Solutions, Cobham Sensor Systems in Lowell and Cobham Sensor Systems in Lansdale respectively in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
These assets are held as security against the finance lease liabilities.

84 Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to 0.9m 2008: 1.4m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the property, save for depreciation.
The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 3 and 25 years, commencing in 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2008.
The fair value of the Groups UK investment properties has been assessed to be 9.5m 2008: 10.2m, excluding the property which has been sold during 2009.
This is based on estimated market prices provided by external valuers, Vail Williams LLP, as at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.
The fair value of the Groups investment property in the US is not considered to be significantly different from its cost at the date of acquisition of US$8.9m.
Investments in joint ventures The Group has the following interests in joint ventures within the Aviation Services Division: a 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Dfense Service SA, a company incorporated in France.
b 50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England.
c 50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England.
d 50% of the voting share capital in FB Leasing Limited, a company incorporated in England.
Notwithstanding the fact that the holding is 45%, governance structures for Aviation Dfense Service SA are such that the group has joint control with its partner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.
During the year a new joint venture was formed, Northrop Grumman Cobham Intercoms LLC.
This is a company incorporated in the US, in which the voting share capital is divided equally between Cobham and Northrop Grumman Corporation.
The joint venture operates within the Cobham Defence Systems Division and is expected to commence operations during 2010, providing vehicular communications systems to the US Army.

The amount provided is therefore the amount considered likely to be payable in the event of these conditions being met.
Arrangements of this nature vary, but may typically extend for up to five years and are discounted where payable after two years.
The provision at 31 December 2009 is not discounted comparatives are stated after a discount of 0.1m and the unwinding of the discount in the year resulted in a finance charge of 0.1m 2008: 0.4m.
com | Group financial statements Under current IFRS standards, addition to or release of contingent consideration provisions in periods after the completion of the related transaction are regarded as purchase price adjustments and are accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill see note 14.
Warranty claims The warranty provision represents managements best estimate of the Groups liability under warranties granted on products sold, based on past experience and industry averages for defective products.
It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next two financial years.
Contract loss provisions Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under those contracts.
The timeframe within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, but is generally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months, and where specific conditions exist regarding the state of a leased aircraft on its return to the lessor at the end of the lease.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity or on incurring the expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Other provisions Other provisions include provisions recognised in connection with the Groups investment in the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, legal claims and warranties given on the disposals of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group in 2005.
All amounts have been determined based on managements current estimates of likely outcomes.
Provisions relating to the Countermeasures and Fluid and Air disposals are likely to unwind over a period of more than one year but, due to the uncertainty over the timing and amounts, have not been discounted.
All other items are likely to be resolved within two years.

Other deferred tax assets and liabilities shown above include balances arising from temporary differences in relation to provisions, share-based payments, goodwill and derivative financial instruments.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes are analysed as follows: m 2009 2008 Deferred tax liabilities fall due as follows: Within one year 1.1 4.5 After one year 36.2 53.5 37.3 58.0 Deferred tax assets are recoverable as follows: Within one year 18.8 4.5 After one year 3.5 4.5 22.3 9.0 Without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances, deferred tax balances are as follows: Accelerated tax Retirement benefit m depreciation obligations Intangible assets Other Total Deferred tax assets 0.1 32.3 25.2 57.6 Deferred tax liabilities 9.9 53.5 9.2 72.6 At 31 December 2009 9.8 32.3 53.5 16.0 15.0 Deferred tax assets 0.1 14.3 17.0 31.4 Deferred tax liabilities 10.6 56.0 13.8 80.4 At 31 December 2008 10.5 14.3 56.0 3.2 49.0 90 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of 73.5m 2008: 72.9m potentially available for offset against future profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 407.8m 2008: 448.2m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Groups share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures was 4.0m 2008: 4.4m.

Draw downs under these arrangements are settled every three months and hence this balance is reported as due within one year.
Other principal borrowing facilities include a US$75.0m credit agreement which runs to December 2031 although the lender has a series of put 91 options exercisable every three years from December 2010.
A number of new floating rate bank borrowing facilities have been agreed during 2009, together with new fixed rate senior notes.
The balance of US$650.0m on the acquisition financing facility agreed in January 2008 was repaid in June 2009.
New bank facilities comprise four separate agreements with total committed facilities of US$250.0m.
The minimum committed period for all facilities falls between 2010 and 2013 during which time interest rates are linked to LIBOR.
The total amount drawn under these agreements at 31 December 2009 was 83.6m.

None of the various loan and note subcription agreements contain any provisions for charges over Group assets, although they do include both financial and non-financial covenants.
The terms of the financial covenants are based on adjusted IFRS results.
There have been no breaches of the terms of agreements or defaults during the current or comparative periods.
All bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.

The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their short term nature.
IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
All financial instruments measured at fair value in the table above are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been determined using significant inputs which are based on observable market data.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by the use of valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates.
As at 31 December 2009, the fair value of the senior notes is 377.7m 2008: 130.0m plus 39.1m for the notes which matured in October 2009.
The Groups investment in the FSTA companies described in note 19e is classified as available for sale.
The Group does not hold any financial assets which would be classified as held to maturity.

Financial instruments and risk management The Groups multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risk and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Financial instruments The Group finances its operations primarily through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use derivative financial instruments these are mainly put in place to manage the currency financing risks arising from normal operations, further details of which are given in note 26, and interest rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk and interest rate risk are the most significant exposures for the Group for which financial instruments are employed as mitigation.
The Group is exposed to other risks such as liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
95 Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the US, with further investments in other European countries, Australia and Canada.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group has transactional currency exposures which arise when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of minimising trading in non-functional currencies, matching non-functional currency revenues with non-functional currency costs and through the use of forward contracts.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities are as follows: 2009 2008 million US$ AUS$ US$ AUS$ Monetary assets 316.3 76.8 58.8 271.4 81.9 50.0 Monetary liabilities 872.1 47.6 98.8 1,070.0 107.8 88.5 The following borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets: million 2009 2008 US dollar borrowings 699.7 838.1 US dollar foreign exchange contracts 172.8 177.4 Euro borrowings 32.9 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which non-US based subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities, and the proportion of the Group based in the US.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December: US$ amount Average US$: exchange rate million 2009 2008 2009 2008 Expiring within one year 176.6 140.0 1.59 1.82 Expiring within one to two years 78.8 70.2 1.57 1.53 Expiring after two years 32.0 75.7 1.68 1.59 287.4 285.9 1.59 1.68 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is September 2014.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on experience over the previous five years.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and includes the effects of derivative financial instruments.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity.

In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency, as follows: 2009 2008 m Sensitivity Profit loss Equity Sensitivity Profit loss Equity US dollars 10% 13.2 13.2 10% 16.3 16.3 Euros 10% 6.3 6.3 10% 2.1 2.1 Australian dollars 10% 10% Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short term borrowings, principally in US dollars and Australian dollars at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to use interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
The Group has fixed rate borrowings under senior notes as described in note 24. www.
com | Group financial statements All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are all designated as cash flow hedges and are as follows: Period of swap contract 2009 2008 Hedged item Fixed rate from to Currency value m m US dollar bank loans 4.48% January 2006 June 2010 US$260.0m 161.0 180.8 3.49% March 2008 March 2013 US$139.0m 86.1 96.7 3.49% March 2008 US$139.0m 96.7 3.61% August 2008 August 2013 US$211.0m 130.7 146.8 3.61% August 2008 US$211.0m 146.8 Australian dollar bank loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$90.9m 50.6 48.1 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$17.8m 9.9 7.2 During the year, US$350.0m of fixed rate senior notes were issued with maturities between 2014 and 2019.
These were hedged as a highly probable forecast transaction using forward starting floating to fixed interest rate swaps notional value of US$350.0m.
As the debt issued was at a fixed rate, the interest rate swaps which had been designated as cash flow hedges were terminated, and the related hedge reserve is being amortised over the life of the original forecast issuance.
In 2009, 2.6m has been reclassified from the hedge reserve and reflected in other finance expense notes 3 and 30.
Surplus funds are placed on short term fixed rate deposits and as such are subject to interest rate exposure.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change of 1.0% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables, including foreign currency exchange rates, held constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity where interest rates rise.
A fall in interest rates would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

For short term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the US a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities and the use of the Groups revolving credit facility which expires in July 2012.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.
2009 2008 m Within one year 1-5 years Over 5 years Within one year 1-5 years Over 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 218.5 16.1 2.8 218.8 28.4 Borrowings 402.9 212.2 164.2 823.9 128.3 0.5 Contingent consideration 4.1 21.8 10.8 Derivative contracts: Gross cash outflows 56.1 133.0 349.9 211.3 18.7 Gross cash inflows 43.3 110.7 0.3 300.9 157.1 13.8 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued In addition, and to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity, it is the Groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in various currencies.
The following facilities, which are at floating rates, were available at 31 December: m 2009 2008 Expiring within one year 48.4 42.6 Expiring between one and five years 65.4 113.8 42.6 Further financing has also been agreed since the year end as detailed in note 36. Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group further limits risk in this area by setting a maximum level for deposits or overdrafts with any one counterparty.
These facilities are reviewed every six months or more often if there is an indication that the credit rating of any of the banks falls below a Moodys Aa3 rating.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are also monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 98 31 December 2009, 6.2% 2008: 7.6% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2009 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 19. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure less than 1.0m of receivables.
The Group has pledged assets only in respect of finance leases and bank accounts as disclosed in notes 15 and 20.
No assets have been pledged in respect of any of the Groups primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities.
In the UK and the US, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the financial statements.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders equity, excluding minority interests, totalling 948.0m at 31 December 2009 2008: 848.2m, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions, proposed dividend levels and Group banking arrangements.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to be considered appropriate.
During the year and subsequent to the year end, additional funding has been secured through private placements.
Such agreements are one of the Groups primary sources of funding and typically the Group borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the US.
As noted above, the Group maintains a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate arrangements and, within the overall net debt, will hold deposits in sterling and borrowings in overseas currencies such as US dollars, euros and Australian dollars funding overseas operations.
