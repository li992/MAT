Accounts The Capita Group Plc 119 28 Share based payment plans continued The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a multiple simulation option pricing valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.
2009 2008 Dividend yield % 2.11 1.88 Expected share price volatility % 26.53 22.38 Risk free interest rate % 2.25 4.62 Expected life of option years 3.12 3.10 Weighted average share price of options granted during the year 3.20 2.74 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

This floor is based on the Companys average share price at the date of vesting.
