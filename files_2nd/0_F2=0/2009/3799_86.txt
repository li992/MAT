No awards can be made under the existing LTIP after July 2010 and a new plan will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting.
The Committee considers that TSR and GFCF performance conditions continue to be appropriate measures for the LTIP as they align the interests of participants with those of the shareholders.
The terms of the proposed new plan will remain broadly similar to those of the existing rules as outlined above, such that awards will continue to be subject to primary performance conditions of TSR and GFCF and the maximum annual opportunity will not exceed 200% of base salary.
The proposed new plan rules have been drafted to take account of current governance guidelines.
Key proposed amendments include the ability to settle awards in shares or cash if required, a reduction in the averaging period for determination of the TSR performance condition from six months to three months and implementation of a recoupment policy in the event of material fraud or misconduct by the recipient.
The principal terms and conditions can be found in the Notice of General Meeting on pages 131 to 132.
