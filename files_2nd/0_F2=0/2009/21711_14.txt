BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER OF ALLBLUE LIMITED continued BlueCrest Capital International Mixed Arbitrage BlueCrest Capital International contributed 12.75% to AllBlue Limited during 2009, with the fund returning an outstanding 45.39% Class A, USD for the calendar year.
The Rates desk, led by CEO of BlueCrest and Head of Trading, Michael Platt, was the strongest performer during 2009, contributing 35.02% to BlueCrest Capital International: Relative Value and FX also performed extremely well with contributions of 3.19% and 2.89% respectively.
All other trading desks within BlueCrest Capital International also generated positive returns for the year.
Profitable trades focused on likely policy responses to the unfolding crisis and an emphasis on long volatility biased strategies.
The uncertainty in the financial markets coupled with unprecedented levels of government intervention and a reduced set of competitors including investment banks reducing their prop desks have led to fantastic opportunities in the space for traded strategies.
Some core areas of trading this year have involved long-dated volatility in the rates space, particularly GBP, basis trading in EUR and forward curve steepeners in USD and EUR.

The Margin to Equity for the programme, a measure that represents the risk being taken in the programme, ranged between 7% and 19%, with an average of 13.6%.
