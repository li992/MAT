Shires Remuneration Committee uses certain key Non GAAP measures when assessing the performance and compensation of employees, including Shires Executive Directors.
The Non GAAP measures are presented in this Annual Report as Shires management believe that they will provide investors with a means of evaluating, and an understanding of how Shires management evaluates, Shires performance and results on a comparable basis that is not otherwise apparent on a US GAAP basis, since many one-time, infrequent or non-cash items that Shires management believe are not indicative of the core performance of the business may not be excluded when preparing financial measures under US GAAP.
These Non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
