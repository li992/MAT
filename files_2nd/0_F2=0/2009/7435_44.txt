Financial risk factors The Companys and Groups business exposes it to certain limited financial risks, such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Groups Treasury department is principally responsible for managing these risks using policies approved by the Board.
Liquidity risk The Companys and Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Company and Group has sufficient funds and facilities available to satisfy its current requirements.
Liquidity forecasts are prepared on a regular basis to ensure the optimal use of facilities and although covenant compliance is tested every six months, forecast compliance is reviewed on a monthly basis.
Longer term projections are also made to assess strategic funding requirements.
During the period under review, the Company secured a 220m multi-currency revolving credit facility, with a final maturity date of 9 October 2011, which replaced the previous facility.
The facility amortises by 20m on 1 January 2010 and a further 20m on 1 January 2011.
The Group also has some locally arranged bank facilities, which do not have a fixed maturity date but are reviewed annually.
Total available at 26 April 28 April 2009 2008 m m Multi-currency revolving credit facility 220.0 260.0 Local facilities 5.2 2.5 Total 225.2 262.5 Fees totalling 1.1m incurred in arranging the new facility have been deferred and are being amortised over the three year term of the facility to October 2011.
Reflecting current credit markets, interest on the new facility is payable at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% compared with a margin of 1.75% on the previous facility.
There are no changes to banking covenants associated with the new facility.
Of the 220.0m 2008: 260.0m revolving credit facility, 46.0m 2008: 35.0m had been drawndown at 25 April 2009.

Financial risk factors continued Analysis of the maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 25 April 2009 is shown below: Less than More than On demand 3 months 3 to 12 months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Bank overdrafts 30.0 30.0 Current borrowings 45.1 45.1 Finance lease Trade and other payables 201.0 201.0 At 25 April 2009 30.0 246.1 276.1 Bank overdrafts 88.9 88.9 Current borrowings 34.8 34.8 Finance lease Trade and other payables 121.0 121.0 At 26 April 2008 88.9 155.8 244.7 Security The borrowings under both the previous and the new Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the Facility Agreement as guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and earnings before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 70% of the total gross assets, revenue and earnings before tax and interest of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited, HMV UK Limited, HMV Ireland Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Ireland Limited and HMV Guernsey Limited.
The Company has granted security comprising first-ranking, fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the Guarantors.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reflected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.
Interest rate risk The Company and Group is exposed to interest rate risk from its borrowings and cash deposits.
However, without core longer term borrowings as is currently the position the strong seasonality to its trading patterns provides that, with the onset of peak trading in December, the Group moves into a net cash position for around three months before reverting to a net debt position until the following December.
As both debt and cash deposits attract a floating rate of interest, this seasonality provides a natural hedge against interest rate risk.
The net exposure is monitored on a regular basis, with consideration given to the supplemental use of interest rate hedging instruments.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and outstanding receivables.
The Group deposits cash balances with counterparties that have a strong credit rating, with an agreed limit for each counterparty, so as to limit the risk of loss arising from a failure.
Counterparties include banks forming the Groups syndicated banking facility.
Trade and other receivables are regularly monitored and are limited in size due to the nature of the Groups business as a retailer dealing predominantly in cash and cash equivalents.
Allowances are made for doubtful debts based on the age of the debt and the customers financial circumstances.
The Company does not have any trade receivables.
