Along with all other staff, the directors received a salary review in July 2008, but agreed to a voluntary salary reduction of 20% from 9th February 2009 to 31st December 2009.

EARNINGS PER ShARE Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on earnings of 3,598,000 2008 34,616,000 and on 72,788,543 shares, being the number of shares in issue during both years.
There is no difference between the weighted average earnings per share and the basic and diluted earnings per share.
Additions to assets in the course of construction of 862,000 2008 877,000 comprise 136,000 2008 181,000 for freehold land and buildings and 726,000 2008 696,000 for plant and equipment.
Therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash generating units CGUs, which are currently the statutory entities acquired.
This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment.
2009 2008 The analysis of acquired goodwill on consolidation is: 000 000 Acquisition of itp GmbH 2,372 2,372 Acquisition of D3 Technologies Limited 75% 1,784 1,784 Acquisition of Renishaw Mayfield SA 75% 1,215 - Acquisition of PulseTeq Limited 75% 198 - 5,569 4,156 The recoverable amounts of acquired goodwill are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections with assumptions as follows: itp GmbH - actual operating results and an average growth rate of 5% for 5 years with a nil terminal growth rate.
D3 Technologies Limited, PulseTeq Limited and Renishaw Mayfield SA - 5 year business plans with a nil terminal growth rate.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
This has been set on the basis of it being an appropriate rate for a market participant.
On this basis, no impairment write downs are required.
There is significant headroom in all the above and for an impairment to arise, there would need to be a significant material deterioration in business: this is considered to be remote.
An increase in 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment.

EMPLOyEE BENEFITS The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.

Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote at general meetings of the Company and receive dividends as declared.
The Articles of Association of the Company do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of shares nor on voting rights.
Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operations, offset by foreign exchange differences on bank liabilities which have been accounted for directly in equity on account of them being classified as hedging items.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the valuation of forward exchange contracts which are effective hedges and mature after the year end.
These are valued on a mark-to-market basis and are accounted for directly in equity and are recycled through the Consolidated income statement when the hedged item affects the Consolidated income statement.
The forward contracts mature over the next three and a half years.

FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Credit risk The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of Group financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Cash Currency 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pounds Sterling 2,373 4,294 2,784 3,700 63,255 77,170 US Dollar 8,283 13,177 177 219 10,012 13,178 Japanese Yen 2,796 5,234 426 246 9,895 9,325 Euro 7,706 14,539 1,749 624 24,660 17,816 Other 2,899 5,559 825 737 1,800 1,332 24,057 42,803 5,961 5,526 20,488 38,183 2009 2008 The ageing of gross trade receivables at the end of the year was: 000 000 Not past due 17,615 32,104 Past due 0 -1 month 3,838 6,579 Past due 1 - 2 months 2,301 2,880 Past due more than 2 months 4,209 2,936 Balance at the end of the year 27,963 44,499 2009 2008 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 1,696 1,651 Changes in amounts provided 2,574 444 Amounts utilised 364 399 Balance at the end of the year 3,906 1,696 Liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid, which can change over time, affecting the Group's interest income.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to market data.
FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS: CONTINuED For non-current other receivables of 4,020,000 2008 nil, 1,484,000 is receivable between 1 and 2 years and 2,536,000 is receivable between 2 and 5 years.
The contracted cash flows for the financial liabilities are the same as the carrying values.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the balance sheet.
Market risk As noted in the Financial review under Risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority of sales being made in these currencies but with a concentration of manufacturing in the UK, Ireland and India.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The main exchange rate which may have a significant effect on the Groups results is the US Dollar.
The Group has hedged its forecasted Euro and Japanese Yen cash flows and hence there is not expected to be a significant impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in these exchange rates against Sterling.
The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.

Further details are noted in the Treasury policies on page 14.
Net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate Currency 000 000 % US Dollar 13,264 13,088 0.25% Japanese Yen 9,329 9,920 0.25% Euro 20,201 21,114 1.00% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
The Company has US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro forward contracts which mature after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of these contracts at the year end was a loss of 5,415,000 2008 loss 4,252,000 see note 21 on page 42.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position.
