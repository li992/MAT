Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
The accounting policies applied to these accounts are consistent with those applied in the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2008.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from the total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the documented investment strategy and information about the investment portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to the purchase which are written off in the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which is bid market prices for listed investments.
Investments are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the income statement within Losses from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains and losses on sales of investments and exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in capital reserves within Gains on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are accounted for in capital reserves within Investment holding gains losses.
Unrealised foreign currency losses on loans are accounted for in an unrealised reserve.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
UK dividends are included net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital return.
Stock lending income and interest receivable are included in the revenue column on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses charged to the Company common to both pools are allocated to the pools in the same proportion as their net assets at the month end immediately preceding the date on which the cost is to be accounted for.
Expenses charged to the Company in relation to a specific pool are charged directly to that pool, with the other pool remaining unaffected.
Losses of one pool are not borne by the other.
Shareholders converting some or all of their shares into shares of the other class will bear the costs of the conversion up to a maximum of 2% of the value of the shares being converted.
Any costs in excess of this cap will be borne by all the shareholders of the Company.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 63 T H E C O M P A N Y Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued d Expenses continued Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: performance fees payable to the Manager are allocated 100% to capital in both pools.
the management fees of the Income pool of assets are allocated 40% to the revenue column and 60% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Income investment portfolio.
the management fees of the Growth pool of assets are allocated 30% to the revenue column and 70% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Growth investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are charged to the capital column.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
In accordance with the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is required and can be found in note 11. e Finance costs Finance costs, including any premium payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs on the Income pool of assets are allocated 40% to the revenue column and 60% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Income investment portfolio.
Finance costs on the Growth pool of assets are allocated 30% to the revenue column and 70% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Growth investment portfolio.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits comprises cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk arising from interest rate fluctuations.
All interest rate swaps were designated as held at fair value through profit or loss and have been designated as effective cash flow hedges in accordance with the provision of FRS 26.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of cash flow hedges during the year are shown in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and are accounted for in the Other reserve, which was created specifically for that purpose.
Derivative instruments are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet.
g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax is computed for each pool separately.
A pool which generates taxable revenues in excess of tax deductible expenses may benefit from the excess of tax deductible expenses in the other pool.
In this instance compensation amounting to half the tax savings in the taxable pool will be transferred to the non taxable pool.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to capital.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 T H E C O M P A N Y h Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the revenue column or the capital column of the income statement, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
i Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 5 on page 67.

This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income in previous years.
No asset has been recognised in the accounts as it is uncertain whether the Company will generate taxable revenue in the future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page for each share class.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in Continental European equity shares, collective investment funds with Continental European exposure and liquidity funds which are all held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in the value of short term liabilities: a bank loan and an issue of floating rate notes, both denominated in Euros, the main purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to hedge the variability in cash flows arising from interest rate fluctuations on the bank loan and floating rate notes.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements - currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year except for the cancellation of the interest rate swap contract during the year which was designated as a cash flow hedge.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing is used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing is limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 T H E C O M P A N Y Foreign currency exposure The fair value or amortised cost of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st March are shown below.
Where the Company's equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2009 2008 Euro Other Total Euro Other Total m m m m m m Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 16.9 16.9 30.4 30.4 Net current assets 95.1 95.1 17.3 17.3 Bank loans 124.6 124.6 107.0 107.0 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 12.6 12.6 59.3 59.3 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 205.9 4.6 210.5 415.4 15.8 431.2 Total net foreign currency exposure 193.3 4.6 197.9 356.1 15.8 371.9 In the opinion of the Directors, the above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to foreign currency risk during the year.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary net foreign currency exposure at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% 2008: 5% appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the Euro and the other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 m m Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 1.8 0.7 Capital return 1.3 3.0 Total profit after taxation for the year 0.5 2.3 Net assets 0.5 2.3 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Conversely, if sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 m m Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 1.8 0.7 Capital return 1.3 3.0 Total profit after taxation for the year 0.5 2.3 Net assets 0.5 2.3 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is broadly representative of the whole year.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits, the fair value of fixed interest rate securities and the interest payable on variable rate cash borrowings.
The Company has no investment in fixed interest rate securities.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The Company has drawn down Euro 35 million on a loan agreement with Barclays Bank plc, repayable on 20th December 2009.
Interest payable on this loan is at the Euro LIBOR rate as quoted in the market for the period of the advance plus a margin of 0.8%.
At 31st March 2008 the interest rate on 80% of the loan had been fixed at 5.74% per annum under the terms of a swap agreement which was broken during the year.
The Company has issued Euro 100 million Floating Rate Notes, repayable on 6th June 2011.
The interest rate payable on these notes is based on the offered rate for three month Euro deposits plus a margin of 0.53%.
At 31st March 2008 the interest rate on 80% of the loan has been fixed at 5.31% per annum under the terms of a swap agreement which was broken during the year.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 95,308 30,661 Investments in Euro liquidity funds 16,856 30,376 Foreign currency bank loan 32,421 5,561 Foreign currency floating rate note 92,130 15,821 Total exposure 12,387 39,655 80 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 T H E C O M P A N Y Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR 2008: same.
The target interest earned on the liquidity funds is the 7 day Euro London Interbank Bid Rate.
The above year end exposures are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the cash balances and investments in liquidity funds have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum exposures during the year, arising from cash balances and liquidity funds, were as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure to floating rates 112,164 83,774 Minimum interest rate exposure to floating rates 61,037 51,666 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2008: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys total exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating rates at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
2009 2008 1% Increase 1% Decrease 1% Increase 1% Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 724 724 543 543 Capital return 847 847 146 146 Total profit after taxation for the year 123 123 397 397 Net assets 123 123 397 397 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the whole year as the level of exposure changed frequently as investments in liquidity funds have fluctuated.
During the year, the highest amount invested in liquidity funds was 46.5m 2008: 83.6m and the lowest was 16.7m 2008: nil.
iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments and other assets or liabilities held by the Company.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 81 T H E C O M P A N Y Notes to the Accounts continued 24.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st March comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 233,331 460,456 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk A list of the Companys investments is given on pages 23 to 27 and pages 34 to 37.
This shows that the majority of the investment portfolios value is in European equities but there is no concentration of exposure to any one European country.
It should also be noted that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2008: 10% in the fair value of equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.
2009 2008 10% Increase 10% Decrease 10% Increase 10% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 23 23 46 46 Capital return 23,174 23,174 45,731 45,731 Total profit after taxation for the year and net assets 23,151 23,151 45,685 45,685 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in settling financial liabilities as they fall due.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, the liquidity of which in normal markets is frequently tested by the Manager and which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 T H E C O M P A N Y Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2009 2008 Three Not more More Three Not more More months than one than one months than one than one or less year year Total or less year year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Repurchase of the Companys shares for future settlement 304 304 28,409 28,409 Other creditors and accruals 343 343 1,559 1,559 Derivative financial instrument 3,042 3,042 Foreign currency bank loan 32,421 32,421 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Foreign currency floating rate note 92,130 92,130 107,010 107,010 647 32,421 92,130 125,198 33,010 107,010 140,020 c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitagates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poor's and Moody's respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Company's assets are clearly ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore, in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading, these assets would be protected.

84 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 T H E C O M P A N Y The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 90% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding liquidity fund holdings, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
2009 2008 000 000 Investments held at fair value excluding liquidity fund holdings 233,331 460,456 Net assets 221,221 400,211 Gearing 105.5% 115.1% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: and the need for issues of new shares, including sale of shares from Treasury.
