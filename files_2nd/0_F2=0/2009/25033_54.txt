Impairment of goodwill continued Client recruitment rates and average revenue per client were based upon actual amounts measured in prior periods which were projected forward in accordance with expected trends.
The directors have performed a sensitivity analysis around the cash flow assumptions and have concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
On the basis of the results of the above analysis there was no impairment of goodwill during the year.
