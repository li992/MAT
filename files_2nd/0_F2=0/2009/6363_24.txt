Short leasehold property under 50 years is depreciated over the life of the lease.
Equipment and vehicles are depreciated over periods up to a maximum of ten years.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments, which comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
External debtors Debtors do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The company provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
Cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts Cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the profit and loss account on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
External creditors Creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at their fair value.
Amounts owed to from subsidiary undertakings Amounts owed to from subsidiary undertakings bear interest at prevailing market rates.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the company only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups fixed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The company manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Notes to the parent company financial statements G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 114 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued a Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless they qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below: Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the profit and loss account when the hedged cash flow impacts the profit and loss account.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Leases Annual rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The financial statements of the company are presented in sterling, its functional currency.
Transactions in currencies other than sterling are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the profit and loss account.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pensions The company participates in multi-employer pension schemes in the UK, which provide benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The company is unable to identify its share of the schemes assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
In accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the company treats the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognises charges as and when contributions are due to the scheme.
Details of the schemes are included in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.
Share-based payments The company grants equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The fair value of share-based payments granted in the form of options is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes valuation technique, adjusted for future dividend receipts and for any market-related performance conditions.
When share options are exercised the resulting entries are to increase share capital and share premium for the new shares issued.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid.
Dividends proposed but not declared are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Financial guarantees The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group.
The company treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Own shares held by employee benefit trust Transactions of the company-sponsored employee benefit trust are included in the parent company financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the company are debited directly to equity.

Bank overdrafts, bank loans, loan notes issued in July 2008 and May 2009 are stated at amortised cost.
The loan notes issued in March 2007 are stated at amortised cost recalculated at an effective interest rate current at the balance sheet date as they are part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The directors believe the fair value of the companys bank overdrafts, bank loans and the loan notes issued in March 2007, calculated from market prices, approximates to their book value.
US$265m 164.1m of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of 29.9m.
The fair value of the remaining notes approximates to their book value.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is detailed in note h. There were no financial liabilities upon which no interest is paid.

The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company therefore hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The company no longer uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
This foreign exchange hedging program was terminated in February 2009.
The company believes cash flow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets, given the changed liquidity environment post the global credit crisis.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 134.2m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
At 31 December 2009 the nominal value of such contracts was 170.3m in respect of US dollar 2008: 246.9m and 217.7m in respect of euro 2008: 271.7m, their weighted average interest rate was 5.0% US dollar 2008: 5.0% and 3.7% euro 2008: 3.8%, and their weighted average period to maturity was two and a quarter years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 was kept at fixed rate.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
The company acts as a market intermediary, arranging commodity swaps and commodity options with its relationship banks with back to back deals on identical terms with its subsidiaries to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2009 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 27.6m and 14.1m and both were held with institutions with long-term Moodys credit ratings of Aa3.
These exposures represent 40% 2008: 40% and 20% 2008: 24% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loans outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2009.
The company participates in the groups multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Aa3 rated bank.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
i Provisions for liabilities and charges Onerous contracts m At 1 January 2009 2.0 Utilisation of provisions 0.8 At 31 December 2009 1.2 The onerous contracts provision comprises a provision against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall and for long-term idle properties.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing the properties.

At 31 December 2009 guarantees totalling 387.3m 2008: 649.5m were in place in support of such facilities.
The company is included in a group registration for UK VAT purposes and is therefore jointly and severally liable for all other UK group companies unpaid debts in this connection.
