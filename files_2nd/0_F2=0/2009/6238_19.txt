Vh [daadlh IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations and IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, issued in January 2008.
IFRS 3R introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs, and future reported results.
IAS 27R requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by partially-owned subsidiaries as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
Other consequential amendments were made to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, IAS 12 Income Taxes, IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, IAS 28 Investment in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
The changes introduced by IFRS 3R and IAS 27R will affect future acquisitions or loss of control and transactions with Minority interests.
Improvements to IFRS In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.

For depreciation calculated under the unit-ofproduction method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and or amortisation of mine specic assets.
This results in a depreciation amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine production.
Each items life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is located.
These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves.
Changes are accounted for prospectively.

Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
Fair value for mineral assets is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash ows arising from the continued use of the asset, which includes estimates such as eventual disposal and using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account.
Cash ows are discounted by an appropriate discount rate to determine the net present value.

The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in equity.
On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value.
Cost comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
98 FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production UOP basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process.
Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences when assets are available for use.
"The expected useful lives are as follows: Years Buildings 5-12 EaVci VcY Zfj ebZci ""&& Mining properties and development costs 3-9 Other assets 2-7 An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benets are expected from its use or disposal."
Any gain or loss arising at fide-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is fide-recognised.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classied as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
Assets are not depreciated when classied as held for sale.

Mining properties and development costs Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred.
Purchased mineral reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benets are expected to be obtained from that specic concession.
Expenditure on mine development is capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment.
Mine development activities commence once there is sufcient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specic project.
Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the development phase, prior to commercial production, is credited to development costs.
Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.
Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
Subsequent expenditures All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is fide-recognised.
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Stripping costs In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste in order to access the ore body.
During development and preproduction phases, these costs are capitalised as part of the initial mine investment and they are depreciated based on the mines production once commercial operations begin.
Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a mine.
This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the mine.
The costs of production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs.
Further development of a mine may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase.
Stripping costs associated with such development activities are capitalised and depreciated based on the related production.

Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year.
An independent competent person has veried the reasonableness of these reports as at 31 December 2009.
Reserves are used in the unit-of-production calculation for depreciation, the determination of the timing of mine closure and for determining value in use for any impairment analysis.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves.
Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change signicantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being restated.
h Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash ows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet.

When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classied as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value through profit or loss on inception are included in this category.
Financial assets are classied as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term.
Derivatives are also classied as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.

Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classied in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent investments that have a quoted market price in an active market, therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement, available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity.
Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available and for listed non-actively traded securities, fair value is determined using a valuation technique.
Valuation techniques include using a recent arms length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis and option pricing models.
If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value.

If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Mine closure cost A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.

This plan was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007.
For members as at 30 June 2007, benets were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index NCPI.
The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial rm as at each year end balance sheet date.
"The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA Standard & Poors and 666""bZm : iX] WXV XgZY i""gViZY WdcYh i]Vi ]VkZ bVijg in YViZh Veegdm bVi c i]Z iZgbh d[ i]Z gdjeh dWa Vi dch VcY i]Vi VgZ YZcdb cViZY in the same currency in which the benets are expected to be paid."
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
If the benets have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately.
The dened benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the dened benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benets available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.

Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due.
The contributions are based on the employees salary.
This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.
Seniority premium for voluntary separation This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service.
Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service.
For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.
The cost of providing benets for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial rm as at each year end balance sheet date.
Other Benets for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.
Termination payments for involuntary retirement dismissals are charged to the income statement, when incurred.
p Employee profit sharing In accordance with local legislation, companies in Mexico must provide for employee profit sharing equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income of each year.
This amount is charged to the income statement and is considered deductible for income tax purposes.
q Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fullment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specic asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: a.
There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement: b.
A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term: c. There is a change in the determination of whether fullment is dependent on a specified asset: or d. There is a substantial change to the asset.

&% FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT u Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability.
v Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: i where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: i where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
w fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally fide-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.

For gains and losses related to the hedging of revenues, these are included as part of revenues and for those related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reected.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash ow hedges is recognised in the income statement of the related period.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in equity from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.

Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Companys subsidiaries.
z Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
za Borrowing costs Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the nancing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use.
In the case of such qualifying assets, finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use.
The amount of finance costs capitalised before the effects of income tax for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period.

There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Silverstream contract: The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model for further information relating to Silverstream contract see note 15.
This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and or the duration of the contract.
Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican Peso and US Dollar, future ination and the discount rate used to discount future cash ows.
128 FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, ination and the discount rate is disclosed in note 32.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production prole based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined.
The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time.
Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company.
The production prole and estimated payable silver that will recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peoles.
The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.

Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery see note 2 s. This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract.
The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non observable input to this valuation.
