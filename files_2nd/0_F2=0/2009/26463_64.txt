London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report 2009 71 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The recoverable amounts of these CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations, using discounted cash flow projections prepared by management covering the five year period ending 31 March 2014.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated long term growth rates and applying the pre-tax discount rates referred to below.
The amount of the net book value of goodwill allocated to each CGU is set out below.

The values assigned to short and medium term revenue and cost growth assumptions reflect current trends, anticipated market developments, discussions with customers and suppliers, and managements experience, taking account of an expected recovery in underlying financial markets.
Long term growth rates assumed to be 2.5 per cent for each of the Borsa Italiana group CGUs, and 3.0 per cent for Proquote and EDX represent managements internal forecasts based on external estimates of GDP and inflation for the ten year period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2013, and do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the countries in which the CGUs operate.
Pre-tax discount rates are based on a number of factors including the risk-free rates in Italy and the UK, as appropriate, the Groups estimated market risk premium and a premium to reflect the inherent risks of each of the CGUs.
The impairments detailed in the table above were all written off against goodwill and were driven by the significant deterioration in the economic conditions in the markets concerned, corresponding reductions in expected revenues, greater uncertainty about the future and changes in applicable discount rates.
Value in use calculations for each CGU are sensitive to changes in short and medium term revenue and cost growth assumptions, long term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
The impact on value in use of a change in these assumptions is shown below: Impact on value in use of: 0.5% Excess 0.5% increase of value 5% 5% reduction in pre-tax in use over reduction in increase in long-term discount carrying value revenues in costs growth rate rate Cash generating unit m m m m m Borsa Italiana group: Issuer 15.7 10.0 5.8 5.6 Equities Trading 24.3 14.3 11.0 10.4 Derivatives Trading 28.8 11.4 7.2 4.6 4.3 Fixed Income Trading 20.5 10.9 9.6 9.5 Information Services 24.3 11.7 12.7 11.6 Post Trade 55.3 18.5 32.6 29.5 Other 4.0 5.6 3.8 1.4 1.6 Proquote Ltd 3.4 3.6 Management believes goodwill allocated to EDX London Ltd is unlikely to be impaired under any reasonable changes to key assumptions.
The excess of value in use over carrying value is determined by reference to the carrying value, post impairment charge, as at 31 March 2009.
Revenue and cost sensitivities assume a five per cent change in revenues or costs for each of the five years in the value in use calculations.
