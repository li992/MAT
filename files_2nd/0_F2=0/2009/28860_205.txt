Business projections prepared for impairment reviews see Note 17 indicate it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which to offset these recognised deferred tax assets within eight years.
UK losses do not expire and Netherlands losses expire after nine years.
In jurisdictions where doubt exists over the availability of future taxable profits, deferred tax assets of 2,163 million 2008 1,748 million: 2007 687 million have not been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward of 7,759 million 2008 5,779 million: 2007 2,043 million.
Of these losses, 27 million will expire within one year, 18 million within five years and 6,837 million thereafter.
The balance of tax losses carried forward has no time limit.
2 Deferred tax liabilities of 279 million 2008 980 million: 2007 977 million have not been recognised in respect of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and held-over gains on the incorporation of overseas branches.
Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further taxation.
No taxation is expected to arise in the foreseeable future in respect of held-over gains.
The temporary differences at the balance sheet date are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of changes to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
