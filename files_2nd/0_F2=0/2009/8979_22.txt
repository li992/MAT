158 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 MINING RESERVES AND RESOURCES RESERVES AND RESOURCES ESTIMATION METHODS Kazakhmys Copper The Republic of Kazakhstan has incorporated by law the classification system and estimation methods for reserves and resources established by the Former Soviet Union FSU and later revised in 1981.
In practice, this means that the statements of reserves and resources developed by Kazakhmys and the mining plans to which they relate must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for which adherence to the standardised national system of reserves and resources estimate on is mandatory.
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves Conditions were prepared by the corresponding national design institute and were approved within the national formerly Soviet State Plan.
The Conditions apply a well-defined process of classifying the specific deposit into one of five major deposit categories, subject to which, the principles for exploration and classification of reserves and resources have been established.
The Conditions for each deposit specify the method of computation of reserve blocks, the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties.
Reserves and resources have been estimated by Kazakhmys LLC according to the FSU Classification and Estimation Methods for Reserves and Resources.
It is apparent that there is now more scope than previously for flexibility and discussion with state authorities with respect to ore reserve estimation methods.
This has been reflected in the continuing steps taken by Kazakhmys LLC to prepare the records and reserves development plans for the Zhezkazgan mines as  CAD files and to use these as the basis for revised estimation of reserves volumes and to support improved estimation of ore grades.
IMC recognises this as an important step to achieve verifiable and internally consistent estimates.
IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statements of Kazakhmys LLC and has restated the reserves and resources in accordance with the criteria required to meet JORC standards.
As a general rule, in situ tonnages quoted as balance reserves under the national system, and which meet criteria for categories of confidence and which can be considered to have the potential for future economic extraction, are assessed as resources.
The Kazakhmys LLC internal reporting system derives from these resources a category designated as commercial reserves, on which production planning is based, estimated only from active resources to which modifying factors for losses and dilution are applied.
These estimates form the basis for the process of restatement of reserves in accordance with JORC compliant criteria.
All reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution.
Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are inclusive of reserves.
All figures in reserves and resources are in metric tonnes and are dated 31 December 2009.
Kazakhmys Gold Following international convention, the Kazakhmys Gold resources reported in this document are in situ estimates, while the reserves make due allowance for mining recovery and dilution, based on actual operational experience in 2009 or assumptions made in feasibility studies.
Reserves are contained within the resources.
Kazakhmys Power The resources and reserves were calculated on the basis of the following set of parameters: maximum ash content of 40% and minimum coal seam thickness of 2 metres with a specific gravity of 1.3 and a maximum dirt parting of 1 metre, which are excluded from the calculations.
The dilution and losses are 1.96% and 2.15% respectively with an average stripping ratio of 4:1.

2 Development projects relate to Aktogay, Bozshakol, Aidarlay, Zhaisan and Anissimov Kluych.
Mine extensions are included within the original ore body as part of operating mines.
No ore loss or dilution has been included.
2 Silver and gold values for the Zhezkazgan Complex and Balkhash Complex are not available by blocks, only at the borehole level and have been averaged over each operation by Kazakhmys LLC.
3 Development projects relate to Aktogay, Bozshakol, Aidarlay, Zhaisan and Anissimov Kluych.
The total proven and probable reserves of Kazakhmys Copper have decreased during 2009 to a total of 2,728 MT, as compared with 2,825 MT at 31 December 2008.
This decrease in total proven and probable reserves amounts to 97 MT.
The draw-down of reserves due to production during 2009 was estimated to be 29 MT.
The total measured and indicated resources of Kazakhmys Copper have decreased during 2009 to a total of 2,782 MT, as compared with 2,839 MT at 31 December 2008.
This decrease in total measured and indicated resources amounts to 57 MT.
The calculated draw down of resources due to production during 2009 was estimated to be 32 MT.
Inferred resources at Kazakhmys Copper remained largely unchanged at the end of 2009 at 1,603 MT.
2 Gold equivalent ounces have been calculated based on the following prices: copper $4,250 2008: $3,804 per tonne, gold $800 2008: $785 per ounce and silver $13.00 2008: $11.40 per ounce.
3 Operating mines consist of the Mizek and Mukur mines.
4 Development projects relate to Bozymchak.
4 Development projects relate to Akjilga and Bozymchak.
The slight decrease in reserves and resources is largely attributable to production of oxide and transitional ore from Mizek.
At Mukur, recently established resources have made up for production in 2009.
Resources at the other deposits remain unchanged since 2008, pending new estimates based on exploration carried out in 2009.
These resource estimates are expected by mid-2010.

com 163 163 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 IMC GROUP CONSULTING LIMITED REVISION OF RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT TO 31 DECEMBER 2009 IMC Group Consulting Ltd IMC has undertaken a review of the reserves and resources estimates prepared by Kazakhmys PLC the Company, as the basis for the preparation of a statement of reserves and resources as at 31 December 2009.
Tabulations of reserves and resources, comparisons with the previous annual reserve statement and short technical descriptions, are provided for Kazakhmys Copper, Kazakhyms Gold and Maikuben West.
The Statement of Reserves and Resources is restated in accordance with the criteria of the Australasian Code for Reporting Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004, published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and collaborating institutions the JORC Code.
IMC is satisfied, from the review undertaken, that the recently revised estimates of reserves and resources prepared by the Company, is in accordance with the reserve classification system required by law in the Republic of Kazakhstan and that, correspondingly, the estimates have a consistent basis for expressing the degree of confidence for stating quantities of exploitable ore at specific grades of metal content.
On the basis of the estimates supplied by the Company, IMC has applied the same criteria as expressed in the Competent Persons Report at the time of Listing, for preparation of the restatement of reserves and resources as at 31 December 2009, in accordance with the reporting criteria of the JORC code.
In previous annual statements of resources and reserves prepared by IMC, for the mature copper mining operations the policy has been adopted that the category of Measured Resource, and Proven Reserve, will be restricted to that ore which has been exposed or is in the process of development within the rolling three-year forward operations plan as formally reported to the State Reserves Committee.
This policy has again been used for the present statement for Kazakhmys Copper operations as at 31 December 2009.
