New Accounting Standards New IFRS Accounting Standards The following IFRS standards, which are relevant to the Group, have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB but are not yet effective or have not yet been adopted by the Group.
Unless otherwise listed below, no other standard, amendment or interpretation is likely to have a material effect ontheGroupsresults .
In January 2008, the IASB issued a revised IFRS 3 Business Combinationsstandard and an amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Financial Statements standard.
The Group will adopt these standards prospectively to all business combinations on or after 1 January 2010.
Whilst it is not possible to estimate the outcome of adoption, the key features of the revised IFRS 3 include a requirement for acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in the purchase price: and for contingent consideration to be recognised at fair value on acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to goodwill.
The standard also changes the treatment of non-controlling interests formerly minority interests with an option to recognise these at fair value as at the acquisition date and a requirement for previously held non-controlling interests to be fair valued as at the date control is obtained, with gains and losses .
IAS 27 revised no longer restricts the allocation to minority interest of losses incurred by a subsidiary to the amount of the non-controlling equity investment in the subsidiary, as well as clarifying the accounting on disposal ofsubsidiaries goingforward.
Theserevised standards havebeen endorsed bythe EU.
In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
This standard specifies how the Group should classify and measure financial assets.
It requires all financial assets to be either classified on the basis of the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset or initiallymeasured at fairvalue.
