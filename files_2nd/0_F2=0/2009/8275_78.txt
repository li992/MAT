The plan, which is funded and HM Revenue & Customs registered, covers approximately 460 2008 460 employees, of which 150 2008 170 are in the defined benefit section which provides pensions based on final salaries and 310 2008 290 are in the defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime allowance.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are now closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the defined benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US and other benefits Total 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 7 9 1 1 8 10 Interest cost on benefit obligation 22 30 10 10 1 1 33 41 Expected return on plan assets 21 32 8 11 29 43 Operating profit before exceptional items 8 7 3 1 1 12 8 Exceptional items 11 11 19 7 3 1 1 23 8 On 23 January 2009, approval was given for the payment of enhanced pension transfers to those deferred members of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan who had accepted an offer to receive the enhancement either as a cash lump sum or as an additional transfer value to an alternative pension provider.
