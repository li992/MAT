42 Murray Income Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice 'Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts' issued in January 2009 and adopted early.
The early adoption of the January 2009 SORP had no effect on the financial statements of the Company, other than: - the requirement to disclose separately capital reserves that relate to the revaluation of investments held at the reporting date.
These are disclosed in note 14.
This new requirement replaces the previous requirement to disclose the value of the capital reserve that was unrealised.
- the requirement to present tax reconciliations based on the total column of the Income Statement rather than the revenue column as was previously recommended.
The reconciliation is disclosed in note 7.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends and convertibles are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: - transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are recognised as a capital item in the Income Statement.
- expenses are charged to the capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to the capital reserve to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
Murray Income Trust PLC 43 continued Notes to the Financial Statements The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and the revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year.
e Valuation of Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchange's electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net return for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
The valuation of reverse convertibles is carried out by the respective counterparty and is modelled on a long stock and short call basis taking account of implied volatility and including an accrual for yield.
f Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue expenses.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to the capital reserve to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Traded options The Company may enter into certain derivatives eg options to gain exposure to the market.
The option contracts are accounted for as separate derivative contracts and are therefore shown in other assets or other liabilities at their fair value ie market value adjusted for the amortisation of transaction expenses.
The premium received and fair value changes in the open position are normally recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement, however, where the option is written for the maintenance or enhancement of the Company's investments then the change in fair value is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.

The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments as it is exempt from tax on these items because of its status as an investment trust company.
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 13,961,000 2008 - 13,977,000 arising as a result of unutilised management expenses and loan relationship deficits.
Any excess management expenses will be utilised against any taxable income that may arise.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company's financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Company's activities.
During the year the Company entered into three yield-enhanced securities, details of which are provided in the Portfolio of Investments table on page 17.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market risk comprising interest rate and other price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
In line with the Company's investment objective, the portfolio comprises UK securities and therefore has no direct capital exposure to foreign currency risk.
In order to mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting market and sector analysis.
It is the Board's policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown in the Sector Allocations table on page 8.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
"Current strategy is detailed in the Chairman's Statement on pages 4 to 6 in the sections headed ""Performance"", ""Dividends"" and ""Outlook"" and in the Investment Manager's Review on pages 7 to 10 in the sections headed ""Background"", ""Performance"", ""Portfolio Activity"" and ""Structure"", ""Income"" and ""Outlook""."
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks.
The Board has agreed the level of gearing which was 11.9% of net assets as at 30 June 2009 2008 - 10.0%.
The Manager's policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numerical disclosures in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Company's investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out in the Corporate Summary on page 2.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowing powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Manager's Review on pages 7 to 10.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Board's policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 18 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 16 and 1 7.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: 50 Murray Income Trust PLC - the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: - the level of income receivable on cash deposits: - interest payable on the Company's variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Financial assets The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Floating rate Fixed rate Non-interest bearing 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Sterling 13,528 6,390 13,470 5,272 299,914 428,553 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The interest bearing assets represent the equity linked notes and corporate bonds, amounting to 13,470,000 2008 - 5,272,000.
Their weighted average interest rate, based on current yield of the underlying equity, plus a fixed rate of interest on the nominal amount notes held, was 14.86% 2008 - 11.24%.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities The Company has borrowings by way of a loan facility, details of which are in note 12.
The fair value of the loan equates to the cost as the loans are rolled on a monthly basis.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Maturity profile The maturity profile of the Company's financial assets and liabilities at 30 June was as follows: Within Within 1 year 1 year 2009 2008 Assets '000 '000 Fixed rate Equity linked notes 11,654 5,272 Floating rate Cash 13,528 6,390 Murray Income Trust PLC 51 continued Notes to the Financial Statements More than More than 5 years 5 years 2009 2008 '000 '000 Assets Fixed rate Corporate Bonds 1,816 Within Within 1 year 1 year 2009 2008 Liabilities '000 '000 Floating rate Revolving bank credit facility 35,000 Between Between 1 and 2 years 1 and 2 years 2009 2008 Liabilities '000 '000 Floating rate Revolving bank credit facility 40,000 All the other financial assets and liabilities do not have a maturity date.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Company's : - profit before tax for the year ended 30 June 2009 would increase decrease by 135,000 2008 - increase decrease by 64,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Company's exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
- equity reserves would not be materially affected as the fixed interest holdings held are linked to an underlying equity, and therefore covered under the other price risk section.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Board's policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
"The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed in the section ""Investment Policy"" on page 2, both act to reduce market risk."
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary Shareholders and equity for the year ended 30 June 2009 would have increased decreased by 31,338,000 2008 - 43,382,000.
52 Murray Income Trust PLC Liquidity risk The Company's assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
As at 30 June 2009 the Company utilised 35,000,000 of a 60,000,000 revolving bank credit facility.
Interest is charged at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 0.40% for the relevant period of the advance.
The facility expires on 1 October 2009 by which time all advances must be paid.
The aggregate of all future interest payments at the rate ruling at 30 June 2009 and the redemption of the loan amounts to 35,088,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Manager's research of potential investee companies.
The Company's custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company and their performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis and reports its finding to the Manager's Risk Management Committee.
It is the Manager's policy to trade only with Aand above Long Term rated and A-1 P-1 Short Term rated counterparties.
None of the Company's financial assets is past due or impaired.
Capital management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Company is to achieve a high and growing income combined with capital growth through investment in a portfolio of UK equities.
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to Shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Company's capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: - the planned level of gearing which takes into account the Investment Manager's views on the market: - the level of equity shares in issue: - the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Company's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
At the year end financial covenants contained within the loan agreements provide, inter alia, that borrowings shall at no time exceed 45% of net assets and that the net assets must exceed 225 million.
At 30 June 2009 net gearing was 11.9% and the net assets were 294.5 million.
Murray Income Trust PLC 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Contingent assets On 5 November 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that management fees on investment trusts should be exempt from VAT.
HMRC has announced its intention not to appeal against this ruling to the UK VAT Tribunal and therefore protective claims which have been made in relation to the Company will be processed by HMRC in due course.
The Company has accepted the Manager's offer to refund 1,556,000 to the Company, representing all VAT charged on investment management fees for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 August 2007: this has been received in the year and has been allocated to revenue and capital respectively, in accordance with the accounting policy of the Company for the periods in which the VAT was charged.
The amount of any interest due on recoverable amounts and the timescale for receipt are at present uncertain and the Company has therefore taken no account in these financial statements of any such repayment.
The Company has not been charged VAT on its investment management fees since 1 September 2007.
