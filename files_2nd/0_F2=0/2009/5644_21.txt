Risk management Filtronas activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The principal risks faced by Filtrona and managements response thereto are summarised in the Business Review on pages 34 to 37.
The Board has overall responsibility for Filtronas system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Filtrona uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent reviews by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
The following describes Filtronas financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Filtrona has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Filtrona manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Filtronas exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate, which is wide and diverse.
Filtrona monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance is determined based on historical experience.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business.
The following table provides information on the trade and other receivables credit risk exposure.
2009 2008 m m Not impaired or past due: New customers less than one year 2.4 4.4 Existing customers more than one year with no defaults in the past 45.6 58.1 130 days past due not impaired 7.9 11.2 3160 days past due not impaired 1.4 2.5 6190 days past due not impaired 0.4 0.5 More than 90 days past due not impaired 0.6 0.6 Impaired 0.7 0.9 59.0 78.2 79 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I financial statements Notes continued 1.
Risk management continued Trade and other receivables carried at 72.4m 2008: 96.1m include prepayments and accrued income of 5.1m 2008: 6.2m which are not financial assets.
Therefore, these amounts are excluded from the above analysis.
Trade and other receivables also include deferred consideration of 8.3m 2008: 11.7m due from the Itavema Group for the purchase of the Globalpack business.
This amount is also excluded as it is included in the credit ratings analysis below.
Occasionally disputes arise that result in accounts becoming past due.
These are generally recovered in due course and the impairment allowance reflects managements best estimate of recovery.
During the year impairment losses on trade and other receivables of 0.3m 2008: 0.8m have been recognised within net operating expense.
Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.
2009 AAA AA A BBB Not rated Total m m m m m m Deferred consideration 8.3 8.3 Derivative assets 0.6 0.6 Cash and cash equivalents 1.8 11.6 16.3 0.8 1.5 32.0 1.8 20.5 16.3 0.8 1.5 40.9 2008 AAA AA A BBB Not rated Total m m m m m m Deferred consideration 11.7 11.7 Derivative assets 5.3 5.3 Cash and cash equivalents 0.8 8.4 9.9 0.8 1.4 21.3 0.8 25.4 9.9 0.8 1.4 38.3 Filtronas maximum credit risk exposure is 99.9m 2008: 116.5m and no collateral is held against this amount 2008: nil.
ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of either a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bp, 100bp and 200bp in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Currency risk Filtrona publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Filtronas net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
The Company resumed this policy in 2009 after temporarily suspending it in 2008 when, following the significant weakening of sterling against the US dollar and euro in the fourth quarter, the Company repaid substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated financial liabilities and replaced them with sterling denominated debt to reduce the effect of currency movements on the Groups net debt.
As a result, at 31 December 2008, Filtronas net assets were exposed to the impact of foreign currency translation.
80 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I BUsiness cORpORate financial OVeRVieW ReVieW GOVeRnance statements 1.
Risk management continued At 31 December 2009, Filtronas euro denominated assets were fully hedged by its euro denominated borrowings, whilst its US dollar denominated assets were approximately 68% hedged by the remaining US dollar denominated borrowings.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Filtronas transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited.
However, where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 12 months.
Filtrona does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as most US dollar and euro 2008: some US dollar exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will be 100% effective.

The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 50bp, 100bp and 200bp decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bp, 100bp or 200bp and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 50bp, 100bp or 200bp decrease or increase in interest rates on the market values of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.

Risk management continued iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
On 16 April 2009 Filtrona signed an agreement with a syndicate of relationship banks to provide new banking facilities until April 2012.
This facility replaced its existing facilities, which would have expired in November 2009 and May 2010.
Fees of 4.3m paid in respect of these facilities have been capitalised and are being expensed in the income statement over the expected life of the facilities in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Filtronas objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Filtrona is mostly funded by syndicated 3-year 84.7m and US$35.9m term loans and a syndicated US$143.7m revolving credit facility from its bankers.
Loan repayments of 8.0m and US$3.6m are due in both April 2011 and October 2011 with the balance of the loans and the facility maturing in April 2012.
At 31 December 2009 the available bank facilities totalled 186.5m of which 141.7m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtronas available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2009 2008 m m Expiring within one year 27.8 Expiring after one but within two years 18.6 16.9 Expiring after two years 26.2 44.8 44.7 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.
The maturity of Filtronas financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments, is analysed below.

Risk management continued Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Filtronas accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability.
2009 2008 Total Total carrying carrying Loans and Amortised and fair Loans and Amortised and fair Fair value receivables cost value Fair value receivables cost value m m m m m m m m Trade and other receivables 67.3 67.3 89.9 89.9 Derivative assets 0.6 0.6 5.3 5.3 Cash and cash equivalents 32.0 32.0 21.3 21.3 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 139.1 139.1 203.4 203.4 Derivative liabilities 3.1 3.1 19.7 19.7 Trade and other payables 34.1 34.1 60.0 60.0 2.5 99.3 173.2 76.4 14.4 111.2 263.4 166.6 Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
Fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by discounting cash flows at forward rates.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate fair values at the reporting date.
The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities fall within level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as they have been calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
iv Capital structure Filtrona defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings and aims to manage this to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Filtrona may return capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy backs, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation, major restructuring costs and exceptional acquisition fees 2008: includes discontinued operations.
Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees.
During 2009, Filtronas strategy, which was unchanged from 2008, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-toEBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt-to-EBITDA ratios at 31 December were: Restated 2009 2008 Note m m Net debt excluding prepaid facility fees 21 109.7 182.1 Operating profit before intangible amortisation, major restructuring costs and exceptional acquisition fees 56.2 64.6 Plus depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment 3 21.7 22.2 Plus share option expense 18 2.4 1.6 EBITDA 80.3 88.4 Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.37 2.06 83 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I financial statements Notes continued 2.

The weighted average useful economic life of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year was 22.9 years and 12.1 years 2008: 22.9 years and 12.1 years respectively.
Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each operating segment or business as appropriate.

Cash flows beyond the budget period are based on year twos budget cash flows with zero growth.
The estimated cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discounted rate based upon Filtronas estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9.0% 2008: 10.0% adjusted for the risk applicable to each operating segment.
The pre-tax discount rates used ranged from 12.3% to 14.5%.
Any impairments identified as a result of the analysis are expensed to the income statement.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved significantly reducing future cash flows.
The results of these analyses showed that, despite significantly lower post-tax operating cash flows, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to be supported.

Derivatives continued Fair value derivatives protect the Group from currency risk exposure from changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a previously unrecognised firm commitment to buy or sell assets at a fixed price.
Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows.
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur.
With the exception of the receipt of the deferred consideration from the Itavema Group, for the disposal of the Globalpack business, all of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months.
With the exception of the deferred consideration discussed above, all other derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.
At 31 December 2009, Filtrona had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The exchange gains of 0.6m on the US dollar borrowings and the gains of 1.6m on the euro borrowings were recognised in reserves at 31 December 2009.
At 31 December 2008 Filtrona had temporarily suspended its normal net investment hedging policy and had only US$30m of debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in subsidiary undertakings.
Finance income and expense arising on financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are those amounts, excluding the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities, detailed in note 4.
