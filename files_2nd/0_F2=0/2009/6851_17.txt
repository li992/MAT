Notes to the company accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 33 Accounting policies Basis of accounting and presentation The accounts are prepared on a going-concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial reporting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate uctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Changes in accounting policy The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as xed assets on the balance sheet.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of xed assets, and gains on disposal of xed assets that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash ows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The exemption has been taken per FRS 29.2D, and the company is exempt from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain disclosure that complies with FRS 29.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate uctuations on its variable rate loans.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classied as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash ow hedging the variability in cash ows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash ow hedges.
For these cash ow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs are transferred to the profit and loss account as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Other information Management and governance Financial statements and notes Business review Overview Notes to the company accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 33 Accounting policies continued Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The company has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions, other than market conditions.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase in the companys investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an investment reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
In accordance with the exemption within FRS 20 no amount is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of implementation of FRS 20.

The details of terms and interest rates are included as part of the groups portfolio in note 24.
As a result of the post year-end rights issue and subsequent debt repayment, described in note 31, the cash ow hedges in respect of 148.0m of the companys variable rate borrowings will cease to be effective.

These ineffective swaps have been cancelled since the year end.
