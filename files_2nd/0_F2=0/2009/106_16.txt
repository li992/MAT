Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below: Taxation Note 7 Contingent consideration Note 10 Intangible assets Note 11 Impairment of Goodwill and intangible assets Note 11 Share-based payments Note 20 Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities Note 24 50 17555 30 03 2010 Proof 11 17555888COM.
com 2 Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The subsidiaries are companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent gained control until such time as control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of accounting.
On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using consistent accounting policies.
Total Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred.
Total Revenue consists of revenue from online gaming and revenue generated from processing customers cross currency deposits and withdrawals.
It comprises: Casino Casino winnings that are the differences between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts won by customers.
Poker Ring games: Rake, which is the commission charged from each winning hand played.
Tournaments: Entry fees charged for participation in Poker tournaments are recognised when the tournament has concluded.
Emerging Offerings Revenue from Emerging Offerings is defined as winnings from Sportsbook activity and fees charged for participation in Bingo games.
Casino winnings, revenues from the Poker business and Emerging Offerings are stated after deduction of certain bonuses granted to customers.
In the case of white label activity, revenue is the net commission charged.
Other operating income Other operating income consists mainly of revenue generated from processing customers cross currency deposits and withdrawals.
Foreign currency Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies are translated into US dollar equivalents using year end spot foreign exchange rates.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in administrative expenses.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i monetary assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions : and iii exchange rate differences on translation of Group entities that have functional currencies different from US dollars are included in administrative expenses.
indd 51 30 03 2010 12:34 30 03 2010 12:34 888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Taxation The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax base.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Intangible assets Acquisitions Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
For the acquisition completed during the year 2007, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between three months and four years.
For the 2009 acquisition, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be eighteen months with the exception of trade names, which have an indefinite useful economic life.
Intangible assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment.
Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the consolidated income statement.
Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is expensed.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between 3 and 5 years.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Cost comprises the fair value of any assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Carrying amounts are reviewed at each balance sheet date for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives.
The annual depreciation rates are as follows: IT equipment 33% Office furniture and equipment 715% Motor vehicles 15% Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on 31 December, and where applicable an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
com 2 Significant accounting policies continued Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest Group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Financial instruments The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from credit card companies and from e-payment companies.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full amount may not be collected.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Equity Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost.
Liabilities to customers Liabilities to customers comprises the amounts that are credited to customers bankroll the Groups electronic wallet, including provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, along with full provision for jackpots.
These amounts are repayable on demand in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial asset categories and comprise principally the Groups investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Where there is a significant decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of an available-for-sale asset any balance within equity is transferred to the income statement.
Chargebacks The cost of chargebacks is included in operating expenses.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.

The chief operating decision maker has been identified on the management team including the Chief Execute Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
These segments are: l B2C Business to Customer Casino, Poker and Emerging Offering which mainly comprises Bingo, 888s Sportsbook, Live dealer offering and games: and l B2B Business to Business which offers Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand.

Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends this is when paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Share-based payments Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, nil priced options or market value options, the fair value at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.

com 8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share from continuing operations Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share In accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into account all potentially dilutive shares and share options granted, which are not included in the number of shares for basic earnings per share.
In addition, certain employee options have also been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share price during the year and it would not be advantageous for the holders to exercise the option.
The number of options excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 2,124,274 2008: 3,117,110.

In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the fair value of the net assets of the Wink Bingo business was valued by a professional valuation firm and recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 and adjustments from book value have been made where necessary.
These adjustments are summarized as follows: Book Value on Fair value acquisition adjustments Fair Value US$000 US$000 US$000 Liabilities to customers 605 605 1 Intangible assets 2,415 2,415 Net assets 605 2,415 1,810 1 See note 11.
The fair value relates to the recognition of customer relationship US$1,626,000 and trade names intangible assets US$789,000 acquired as part of the acquisition.
The customer relationship intangible asset is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 18 months.
Trade names intangible assets are subject to an annual impairment review.
All intangible assets on acquisition have been identified and fair valued.
The remaining goodwill represents the access to future trade associated with the operation of the Wink Bingo Business.

The earn-out payment is payable in cash by 31 May 2011.
Had the business been owned for the entire year, the revenue and operating profit for 2009 would have been $21.0 million and $3.5 million respectively.
Given that the business was acquired on 31 December 2009 there has been no actual contribution to revenue or operating profit during the year.

The intangible assets include customer lists, royalty agreements, trade names and software.
These intangibles, except for trade names, are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to four years.
On acquisition, the intangible assets have been identified and valued using third party professional valuers.
During the year the Group also acquired an internet domain name which is used in its online Bingo business for a total cash consideration of US$100,000.
With the exception of the US$500,000 acquisition in the prior year, all of the goodwill relates to the bingo cash generating unit.
All of the income streams generated from the bingo business acquisitions have been treated as a single cash generating unit as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to be sufficiently similar.
At the year end, the carrying value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the online Bingo cash generating unit to their present value.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding discount rate and growth rates of the business.
The Directors estimate discount rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the online Bingo business.
The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is 12% 2008: 12% being the Groups specific weighted average cost of capital which also applies to the online Bingo cash generating unit.
In estimating the future cash flows the Group has used conservative estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs incurred.
Growth rates of the online Bingo business are based on past experience and projections of future changes in the online gaming market, taking into account external sources of information such as analysts research reports.
These suggest that Bingo is expected to demonstrate year on year growth.
The Group has used lower and declining growth rates in estimating the future cash flows conservatively reflecting the current uncertainties about the medium-term global economic outlook.
The Directors have used forecasts for the next five years of the expected cash flows, of which the first year is based on the Groups current approved budget.
indd 61 30 03 2010 12:34 30 03 2010 12:34 888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 11 Intangible assets continued An annual growth rate of 2% 2008: 4% was used for 2010, 2% for 2011 2008: 2%, and nil for 20122014 2008: nil.
Following year five, the Group extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity, using an estimated conservative growth rate of 1% 2008: 1%, which is lower than the forecasted long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
Marketing costs associated with the Bingo cash generating unit were projected as a fixed percentage of revenues.
All other operational costs are forecasted as percentage of revenue, such percentage increased conservatively by 10% 2008: 10% in each of the five year periods to 2014, over and above the level of growth in revenues.
The Directors are not aware at this time of any need to change their key assumptions on which they have based their determination of the recoverable amount of the goodwill which would cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
In fact, although such movements are not expected to arise, neither a 1% decrease in the growth rate in each of the next three years nor a 5% increase in the discount rate would have led to an impairment of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill in the current year.
Internet domain name During the prior year the Group acquired an internet domain name based business which is used to generate traffic into the Groups various web sites.
Consideration of $US513,000 was paid in the prior year.
The Directors have performed a valuation of the intangible asset acquired.
The Directors took into account the following factors, amongst other, in determining the fair value of this intangible asset: l Domains ranking with search engines l Traffic ranking as a measure of popularity l Number of unique visitors to the site l Number of links pointing to the domain The Directors concluded that the fair value that should be assigned to the intangible asset is of US$13,000 whilst the remainder of US$500,000 is to be recognised as goodwill given that trade balances acquired were incidental.
No further IFRS 3 disclosures have been given on the grounds of materiality.
Yearly impairment review The Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its acquired intangible assets and goodwill, or when such events or changes in circumstances indicate that these may be impaired.
The result of the review, undertaken as at 31 December 2009, was that no impairment needs to be recognised and the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill is considered appropriate.
Internally generated intangible assets The Group has put in place processes and procedures which enable it to ascertain technological feasibility before development costs are incurred and therefore be in a position to capitalise costs incurred after that point.
Such expenditure is only capitalised when the development cost meets the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38 Intangible assets.
These assets are subject to impairment test wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable on the same basis as described above for acquired intangible assets.
At 31 December 2009 no impairment needs to be recognised and the carrying value of internally generated assets is considered appropriate.
All the financial assets were available-for-sale investments.

com 23 Financial risk management The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments.
Policies and procedures for managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks.
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows: l Cash and cash equivalents l Restricted cash l Trade and other receivables l Available-for-sale financial assets l Trade and other payables l Liabilities to customers l Contingent consideration on acquisition Detailed analysis of these financial instruments is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Financial assets US$000 US$000 Trade receivables 13,382 9,026 Other receivables 7,412 5,897 Cash and cash equivalents 86,836 97,522 Restricted cash 675 922 Available-for-sale financial asset 223 108,305 113,590 In accordance with IAS 39, with the exception of available-for-sale assets, all financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
31 December 31 December 2009 2008 Financial liabilities US$000 US$000 Trade payables 5,239 6,107 Other payables and accrued expenses 33,612 31,747 Contingent Consideration 3,811 Liabilities to customers 37,570 33,284 80,232 71,138 In accordance with IAS 39, all of the above financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
At 31 December 2009 and 2008, the fair value and the book value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were materially the same.
Capital The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders.
The primary objective of the Group is maximizing shareholders value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited to the Groups size, strategy, and underlying business risk.
Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 24, there are no demands or restrictions on the Groups capital.
indd 69 30 03 2010 12:34 30 03 2010 12:34 888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management continued The main financial risk areas are as follows: Credit risk Trade receivables The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables who are the Groups payment service providers PSP.
These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers virtual wallet with the Group.
These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies.
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group.
The Group reduces this credit risk by: l Monitoring those balances on a regular basis.
l Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals.
l Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
l Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and Know Your Customer procedures.
l Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP.
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good credit quality and there is no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation.
None of the balances owed by the various PSP are overdue or impaired.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards chargebacks or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group.
Customers may fail to fulfil their obligation to pay which will result in funds not being collected.
These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring, will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group.
As such the Group provides for these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis of past transactions.
This provision is netted off from the trade receivables balance and at 31 December 2009 was $1,586,000 2008: $1,070,000.
The Groups in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third party measures.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters.
Subsidiaries in its other locations Israel, Antigua and London maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations.
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar.
The Group segregates funds due to customers and holds these funds in separate bank accounts.
These funds are not used to fund activity other than that directly related to customers.
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with low credit rating.
The Group maintains its cash reserve in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.
com 23 Financial risk management continued Restricted cash Restricted cash is mainly attributed to a deposit in respect of the Groups obligation with the developer of the offices of its subsidiary in Israel.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk by type of financial instrument is summarized below: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 Carrying Maximum Carrying Maximum value exposure value exposure US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Trade receivables 13,382 13,382 9,026 9,026 Other receivables 7,412 7,412 5,897 5,897 Cash and cash equivalents 86,836 86,836 97,522 97,522 Restricted cash 675 675 922 922 Available-for-sale financial asset 223 223 108,305 108,305 113,590 113,590 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk exists in the case where the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due.
The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.
In the case of the Groups liability to its customers, the Group maintains these deposits in separate bank accounts which are not used for its day to day operations.
The Group has ensured that cash earmarked to fund its final dividend payment for 2009, is in place.
The Group expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances and will not need to resort to any borrowing.

Market risk Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds.
The Groups policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds or on call over night facilities.
The Group also arranged with its principal bankers that excess funds are swept automatically across its accounts, every night, in order to maximize availability of funds for investments.
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no borrowings.
Given current low US$ interest rate a 0.5% downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year.
However, a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$400,000.
Currency risk The Groups financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: l Mismatch between Balance sheet Liabilities to customers which is predominately denominated in US$ and the net receipts from customers which are settled in the currency of the customers choice, of which sterling GBP and euros EUR are significant.
l Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD the Groups functional and reporting currency and significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies.
l Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including sterling GBP, the euro EUR and the New Israeli Shekel ILS.
com 23 Financial risk management continued The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities.
At 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, there were no outstanding forward contracts.
There were no significant fair value movements on these contracts during the year.
Its responsibility is to manage the cash resources of the Group and minimise the various exposures associated with holding and investing these funds.

b Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received notices, communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect of its activities.
The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of success of such actions.
Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, the Board is unable to quantify reliably any material outflow of funds that may result, if any.

c Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and barred such customers from wagering real money on all of the Groups sites.
