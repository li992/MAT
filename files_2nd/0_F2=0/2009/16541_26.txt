The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that distributions in a year are less than the total distributable results for the year.
The general reserve becomes fully distributable in future periods.
3 In June 2007, Sterlite listed on the New York Stock Exchange and raised US$2,016.0 million before expenses.
The offering resulted in a reduction of Vedantas shareholding in Sterlite from 75.98% to 59.87%.
This reduction has not resulted in any change in control and hence Sterlite continues to be consolidated in Vedantas consolidated financial statements.
This reduction has been accounted in Vedantas consolidated financial statements as an equity transaction.
The carrying amount of the minority interest has been adjusted to re ect the change in Vedantas interest in Sterlites net assets.
The difference between the amount by which the minority interest is adjusted and the net consideration received of US$1,969.4 million is recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of Vedanta.
