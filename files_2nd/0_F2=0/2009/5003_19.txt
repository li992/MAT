u Critical accounting policies The application of the Groups accounting policies requires the management of DS Smith Plc to make estimates and assumptions: these estimates and assumptions affect the reported assets and liabilities and financial results of the Group.
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
The Groups accounting policies that are most critical to an understanding of the results and position of the Group, and the judgements involved in their application, are as follows: i Impairments When applying IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Group compares the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with the higher of their net realisable value and value-in-use to determine whether an impairment exists.
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the cash ows expected to be generated by the asset group of assets being tested for evidence of impairment.
The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgements, in particular those involved in a determining a value based on our current expectations of future conditions and the associated cash ows from the Groups operations, b our determination of the level at which groups of assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from other parts of the business and c our treatment of centrally held assets, could each DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2009 61 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following segments have cash-generating units containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2009 2008 m m UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 144.3 144.2 Plastic Packaging 39.1 34.8 183.4 179.0 Segments with no cash-generating units containing individually significant goodwill 15.9 13.9 199.3 192.9 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units CGU are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculation were: cash forecasts derived from the latest budgets and forecasts for the two years ending 30 April 2011 as approved by the Directors.
Cash ows for the following three years were extrapolated assuming a progressive recovery in margins to historical levels: the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group is 11.8% 2007 08: 10.6%.
The Group believes that the risk prole across the significant markets in which it operates are not signicantly different, hence the same WACC is universally applied across all CGUs: and long-term growth rates are either equal to or less than, the ination assumption.
The outcome of the impairment task for the CGUs containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill is summarised as follows: Headroom m UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 47.6 Plastic Packaging 55.3 The headroom represents the difference between the calculated value-in-use and the net asset carrying value of the CGU.
Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible an impairment would be identied if any of the above key assumptions were changed signicantly.
For instance, factors which could cause impairment are: significant underperformance relative to the forecast results: changes to the way the assets are used or our strategy for the business: a further deterioration in the industry or the wider economy: and an increase in the Groups WACC.
The value-in-use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash ows.
The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but in addition have conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the changes in assumptions that would result in an impairment.
A half percentage point increase in the WACC to 12.3% would result in a reduction in the headroom for UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging reducing to circa 20m.
The headroom for Plastic Packaging would similarly reduce to circa 45m.
In order for there to be no impairments within UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging adjusted operating profits will need to achieve circa 56m in 2014 15: this compares to 68.5m in 2007 08 and 36.5m in 2008 09.
For there to be no impairments within Plastic Packaging, adjusted operating profits will need to achieve circa 16.0m in 2014 15, which compares to 10.7m in 2007 08 and 7.0m in 2008 09.
The assumptions underpinning UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging adjusted operating profits reect managements expectations of a return to historic levels of margins and profitability by 2014 15.
The benets of the restructuring of the Plastic Packaging segment are forecast to deliver the incremental profit growth over the next five years.

Included within the share of profit of associates after interest and tax is an exceptional loss of 5.1m being the Groups share of the after-tax net loss at Rubezhansk incurred in the second half of 2008 09.
This is principally as a result of foreign exchange losses on the US$87 million loan, following the significant decline in the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US$.
Exchange rate movements have resulted in Rubezhansk breaching its banking covenants.
Consequently, due to the uncertainty of the financial position of Rubezhansk, the Group has fully impaired the carrying value of its investment in that associate at the year-end.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED b Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and commodity risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the nancing of these activities.
All derivatives have been designated as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.
The assets and liabilities of the Group as at 30 April in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m m m Derivatives held to Manage the interest rate and currency exposures on borrowings and net investments 11.0 0.4 19.3 41.1 8.3 40.7 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 11.0 0.4 19.3 41.1 8.3 40.7 Derivatives held to Hedge future transactions energy costs 11.2 17.1 4.5 0.2 6.7 16.9 Hedge future transactions foreign exchange on purchases and sales of goods and services 3.2 0.6 0.7 2.6 0.7 Total derivative financial instruments 25.4 17.5 24.4 42.0 1.0 24.5 Current 11.7 7.3 0.7 0.8 11.0 6.5 Non-current 13.7 10.2 23.7 41.2 10.0 31.0 25.4 17.5 24.4 42.0 1.0 24.5 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2009 81 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 20.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c Cash ow, fair value and net investment hedges i Cash ow hedging reserve movements The following table identies the movements in the cash ow hedging reserve during the year.
2009 2008 m m Balance at 1 May 13.0 1.5 Unrealised fair value gain loss on designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts 1.6 0.4 Cross-currency and interest rate swaps 4.6 1.5 Commodity contracts 2.3 13.0 Losses gains in equity recycled to the income statement Forward exchange contracts 0.6 0.2 Cross-currency and interest rate swaps 0.3 Commodity contracts 5.1 0.5 Losses gains in equity recycled to the balance sheet Forward exchange contracts 0.5 Cross-currency and interest rate swaps Commodity contracts Balance at 30 April 2.7 13.0 Gains and losses in equity transferred into profit or loss during the period are included in the following line items on the face of the income statement: Gains and losses in equity transferred onto the balance sheet during the period are included in the following line items on the face of the balance sheet: 2009 2008 m m Revenue 0.9 0.1 Cost of sales 5.4 0.6 Finance costs 0.3 4.5 0.4 2009 2008 m m Property, plant and equipment 0.5 ii Fair value hedges At 30 April 2009, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on xed rate debt payable by the Group.
The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the hedging is highly effective.
The pre-tax gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was 48.4m 2007 08: gain of 8.8m offset by a pre-tax loss on the fair value of the debt of 47.2m 2007 08: loss of 8.4m.
iii Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on the hedges recognised in equity in the year was 19.4m 2007 08: loss of 20.0m.
The gain or loss is matched by a similar gain or loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiarys net assets.
During the year, hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedges of net investments resulted in a loss of 0.6m 2007 08: loss of 0.7m.
d Risk identication and risk management i Capital risk The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash ow, borrowings, shareholders equity and disposals of peripheral businesses, where appropriate.
The Groups objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing exibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions.
The Group also aims to maintain a strong balance sheet and to provide continuity of nancing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED d Risk identication and risk management continued i Capital risk continued The Groups overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury strategy is controlled though the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and the Group Treasurer.
The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer.
The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for interest rate, foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management.
ii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument uctuate because of a change in market prices.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both xed and oating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix between xed and oating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
At 30 April 2009, 35% 2008: 16% of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings were xed for a period of at least one year.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates representing managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the market values of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The results are presented before minority interests and tax.
2009 2008 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit total equity profit total equity m m m m Increase in market interest rates by 100 basis points 1.8 2.3 Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between xed and oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
At 30 April 2009, losses of 2.5m 2008: gains of 1.1m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash ow hedges of interest rate risk.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur over time to 2016.
During the year, nil of gains deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2007 08: 0.3m.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Groups presentational currency.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps.
Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves.
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency swaps designated as either cash ow or fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange risk on transactions Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash ow hedges.
At 30 April 2009, 1.4m 2008: 0.4 m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash ow hedges.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years.
During the year, 0.6m of losses deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2007 08: 0.2m of losses.
The Groups main currency exposures are from the euro and US dollar.
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Groups results of a 10% change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other currencies.
10% represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The analysis is only on financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
Loans that are treated as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Groups profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these are offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge.

Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
At 30 April 2009, 4.8m 2008: 12.3m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
During the year, 5.1m of gains deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2007 08: 0.5m of losses.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is managements assessment of the reasonably possible approximation of how much markets can move, on average, over any given year.
In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may be more volatile.
A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity.
As all of the Groups commodity financial instruments achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either financial year.

In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts see note 15.

During the year increased scrutiny has been given to all of the Groups banking counterparties and exposures have been reduced if deemed necessary.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED d Risk identication and risk management continued iv Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate financial resources, by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash ows and by matching the maturity prole of financial assets and liabilities to these risks.
e Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arms-length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which bear oating-rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
For current and non-current receivables note 15 and current and non-current payables note 16 and provisions note 22, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value and is not included in the table below.

At 30 April 2009, deferred tax assets were recognised for all taxable temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses except where it is unlikely that taxable profit will be available against which to offset the loss.
Legislation to remove tax depreciation on UK Industrial Buildings was enacted in the year and as a result deferred tax of 13.3m has been provided in respect of temporary differences relating to certain UK buildings.
This has been treated as an exceptional item.

In respect of the Companys shares that are held by the Group see below, all rights are suspended until those shares are reissued.
A reconciliation of the movement in share capital is given in note 9 to the Company balance sheet on page 105.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash ow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Refer to note 20 c for further analysis of movements in the hedging reserve.
Own shares The reserve for the Companys own shares comprises the cost of the Companys shares held by the Group.
The Group operates a General Employee benefit Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Executive Share Option scheme, the Restricted Share Plan discontinued in 2004 and the Long-Term Incentive Plan established in 2004.
At 30 April 2009, the Trust held 2.4m shares 2008: 2.4m shares.
The market value of the shares at 30 April 2009 was 1.9m 2008: 3.1m.
Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Minority interests At the beginning of the year, the Group had a liability of 3.5m and a corresponding entry against minority interests in respect of the non-controlling shareholders put option in Toscana Ondulati SpA.
This amount was calculated with reference to the recent profitability of the company using a multiple based formula.
The fair value of the put options increased during the year by 0.9m.
This charge was recorded within finance costs through the income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into minority interest.
POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS Liability for dened benefit obligations The Group operates a funded, dened benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme the Group scheme.
In 2006 07 the Group operated a second funded, dened benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Containers Pension scheme the Containers scheme : the assets and liabilities of the Containers scheme were transferred to the Group scheme on 30 April 2007, with the effect that only the Group scheme operated from 1 May 2007.
The Group made agreed annual contributions of 15.6m to the Group scheme in 2008 09 2007 08: 14.6m.
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these are, in aggregate, not significant to the Group.
The financial information given on pages 91 to 93 includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was as at 30 April 2007, which has been updated to 30 April 2009 by a qualied independent actuary.
All UK valuations used the projected unit method.
The Group scheme is closed to new entrants.
Because of this, the average age of the active members is likely to increase at future valuations and this may lead to an increasing current service contribution rate: this may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary resulting from leavers and retirements.

The basic mortality table used by the Group at 30 April 2009 is PMA92 PFA92 30 April 2008: PMA92 PFA92 with medium cohort mortality improvement.
This means the mortality rates assumed for members of a particular age differ from those for members who will reach that age in the future.
Studies have illustrated that the amount of pension, the location of employees and the nature of their work are significant factors on mortality.
As a result, the basic mortality table rates are based on ages two years older than the members actual age for non-pensioners and three years older for pensioners.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: i An Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS was operated for Executive Directors and other senior executives, this scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008.
Approved and unapproved options were granted to UK and overseas executives on an annual basis.
The vesting of any options granted under this Scheme is subject to the achievement of long-term performance conditions, being that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three-year period following grant.
The base financial year for the purposes of measuring earnings per share growth was the financial year prior to the grant date.
Normally, no part of the option will vest unless the long-term performance conditions have been achieved and the vesting period of three years service has been attained.
ii In the past, Executive Directors and other senior executives received an award of shares in the Company equal in value to the participants annual cash bonus, pursuant to a Restricted Share Plan RSP.
The award of these shares is dependent upon performance in the relevant financial year.
There is a vesting period of three years service.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2004. iii In September 2004, the Group established a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, this scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008.
The key features of the plan are that: awards were made to selected Executive Directors and other senior executives over shares in the Company: performance will be measured over a single period of three financial years: awards will vest based on the Companys total shareholder return being the increase in share price and the value of reinvested dividends compared to a comparator group of companies, being the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts for initial awards: if the Companys total shareholder return is ranked at the upper quartile of the comparator group or higher, the full award will vest, reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance: and additionally, no awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Companys earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.
iv A Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP is operated for Executive Directors.
Shares awarded to Directors under the Plan will vest automatically if the Director is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award.
v A Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan RDSP was introduced during 2007 08 for Mr S W Dryden.
The shares awarded under the Plan replace similar deferred share awards granted to Mr Dryden by his previous employer.
vi A Performance Share Plan PSP was approved during the year to replace the ESOS and LTIP plans above see Remuneration Report for further details.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2009 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE CONTINUED The key features of the PSP are as follows: awards are made to Executive Directors and other senior executives.
the individual grant limit under the PSP is 150% of basic salary per annum in exceptional circumstances this may be increased to 200% of basic salary.
During the 2008 09 period Executive Directors received an award under the PSP of 150% of basic salary.
The other most senior executives generally received a PSP award of 100% basic salary.
the vesting of each 2008 award is subject to three equally weighted performance measures: i the Companys total shareholder return TSR compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250: ii average adjusted earnings per share EPS : iii average adjusted return on average capital employed ROACE.
for those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments, for 2008 the three measures are TSR of the Company, average adjusted operating profit and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment.
future awards under the PSP will be subject to a combination of the same performance measures however the weightings of the measures may be altered and certain measures may not be used in all years.
the 2009 award will be reduced to a maximum of 100% of basic salary and the award weightings will be as follows: 80% each award will be based on a TSR component as per above: and 20% of each award will be based on average adjusted ROACE.
for those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments, for 2009 the two measures are TSR and ROACE for the relevant segment.
each awards performance will be measured over the three financial years commencing on 1 May preceding the award date.
see the Remuneration Report on page 42 for a summary of threshold and upper targets for the 2008 09 and 2009 10 PSP awards.

This is the first year of operation for the PSP scheme, accordingly there is no comparative information.
The fair value of the PSP award granted during the period determined using the stochastic valuation model, was 2.2m.
The significant inputs into the model were share price of 1.24 for the PSP at the grant date: the exercise prices shown above: expected volatility of share price of 37.5%: scheme life disclosed above: annual risk-free interest rate of 4.2% and expected dividend yield of 7.1%.
The volatility of share price returns measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of average weekly share prices over a period of three years.
The significant input into the model for the DSBP plan was share price of 1.15 2008: 2.37 at the grant date.
There were no grants for the LTIP or ESOS during the period as these plans ceased to be operated during the 2008 09 period.
The fair value of options granted during the 2008 period, determined using the stochastic valuation model, was 2.0m.
The significant inputs into the model were: share price of 2.37 for LTIP, 2.44 for ESOS: exercise prices shown above: standard deviation of expected share price returns of 24.1% for LTIP and 26.6% for ESOS: options life disclosed above: annual risk-free interest rate of 5.5% for LTIP and 5.4% for ESOS: and expected dividend yield of 3.6% for LTIP and 3.5% for ESOS.
The volatility of share price returns measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns was based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over a period of three to six years.
