Close Brothers Annual Report 2009 91 b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations or fails to perform them in a timely fashion and arises mainly from the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as the businesses in that division trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any credit exposure is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Maximum exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 July, before taking account of any collateral, was: 2009 2008 million million Cash and balances at central banks 1.7 1.5 Settlement balances 508.7 450.0 Loans and advances to banks 196.5 307.8 Loans and advances to customers 2,364.9 2,232.2 Debt securities 2,299.2 2,160.3 Equity shares 62.0 87.8 Loans to money brokers against stock advanced 158.3 106.8 Derivative financial instruments 32.5 10.9 Undrawn commitments 329.3 332.1 Guarantees 10.9 22.7 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 5,964.0 5,712.1 Collateral held in respect of financial assets Loans and advances to customers are diversified across five different segments, are generally short term in nature and with low average loan size.
The large number of customer loans spreads the credit risk with the rate of default impacted by economic conditions in the UK.
The vast majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 16 of the Business Review.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria are applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
Furthermore, conservative loan to value ratios are applied to mitigate credit risk.
This approach has limited impairment losses to 2.6% during the economic downturn in 2009 and to no more than 1.5% in any of the preceding five years.
At 31 July 2008 the group had securitised 172 million of its loans and advances to customers with Cruise Limited Cruise in return for non-refundable finance of 165 million.
This securitisation facility expired during the year and has not been renewed.
The group has entered into a repurchase agreement whereby floating rate notes to the value of 551.6 million have been lent in exchange for cash of 397.7 million.
The agreement matures in November 2010.
These floating rate notes remain on the groups balance sheet and the group retains the risk and rewards of ownership.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced are the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market making activities.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.

The factors considered in determining whether assets are impaired are outlined in the accounting policies in note 1 o on page 59.
The amount of interest income accrued on impaired loans and advances was 13.9 million 2008: 6.1 million.
Whilst collateral is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with credit policy, this varies according to the type of lending and collateral involved.
It is therefore impracticable to estimate and aggregate current fair values for collateral.
Concentration and quality of financial assets The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties that are connected entities.
The loan book is well spread, short term, secured and with a low average loan size in order to avoid concentration risk.
The credit quality of the counterparties with whom the group places deposits or whose debt securities the group holds is monitored by the Treasury Committee which establishes specific limits.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
