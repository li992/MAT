After a reduction in the nominal value of the new ordinary shares, the merger reserve created by the Scheme was capitalised through an issue of A shares, and then reduced through a court-approved capital reduction.
This created sufficient distributable reserves to distribute 512.5m to shareholders.
In July 2007, the Company redeemed all 119.4m of the outstanding deferred shares.
This resulted in an increase of 238.7m in the capital redemption reserve, a non-distributable reserve set up as a result of the 512.5m capital return.
The reverse acquisition reserve is a non-distributable capital reserve arising on consolidation as a result of the Scheme.
The issue of new shares in the Company in exchange for shares in Borsa Italiana S. p. A. see note 35 has attracted merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Of the 1,307.7m market value of new shares 5.5m has been credited to share capital and 1,302.2m to the merger reserve.
This is offset by a 3.0m debit to the merger reserve which relates to the costs associated with the issue of the new shares.
The foreign exchange translation reserve reflects the impact of foreign currency on the translation of foreign operations.
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative fair value adjustment recognised in respect of cash flow hedges and the net investment hedge.
