GSK Annual Report 2009 162 Notes to the financial statements 42 Employee share schemes continued Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options and awards to arrive at the share based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2007, 2008 and 2009 are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Risk-free interest rate 1.4% 2.9% 1.3% 4.8% 4.7% 5.3% Dividend yield 5.2% 4.8% 4.0% Volatility 23% 29% 19% 24% 17% 25% Expected lives of options granted under: Share option schemes 5 years 5 years 5 years Savings-related share option and share award schemes 3-4 years 3 years 3 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Ordinary Shares 11.72 11.59 14.41 ADS $33.73 $45.02 $57.59 Volatility is determined based on the three and five year share price history where appropriate.
The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three year measurement period.
Awards granted to Directors and members of the CET prior to 2009 are subject to a single performance condition which compares GSKs TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.
For awards granted from 2009 onwards to Directors and members of the CET, 40% of the award will be based on the achievement of adjusted free cash flow targets over a three year measurement period.
The remaining 60% of the award will be based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group as described on page 78.
Half of the TSR element of each award will be measured over three years and half over four years.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees prior to 2009 the performance conditions consist of two parts, each of which applies to 50% of the award.
The first part of the performance condition compares GSKs EPS growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period.
The second part of the performance condition compares GSKs TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.
For awards granted from 2009 onwards, the first part of the performance condition continues to be based on EPS.
The second part of the performance condition is based on strategic or operational business measures, over a three year measurement period, specific to the employees business area.
