If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
A CGU is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Where the fair value of share options requires the use of a valuation model, fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes, Binomial Lattice or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme, as set out in note 33.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take account of market conditions applicable to the option.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the contract.

A dividend waiver is effective for those shares held on behalf of the Company by its Employee Share Ownership Trust note 30 c. 12.
Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share EPS have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
EPS is shown both before and after amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition note 14 to assist in the understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data: Number of shares 2009 2008 Millions Millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 486.6 485.7 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options 5.6 7.3 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 492.2 493.0 Earnings Per share Per share Earnings amount Earnings amount 2009 2009 2008 2008 m Pence m Pence Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS being net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent 130.2 26.76 99.5 20.49 Add back: Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, net of tax of 4.1m 2008: 0.9m 13.5 2.77 8.3 1.71 Adjusted earnings before amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition 143.7 29.53 107.8 22.20 Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS 130.2 26.76 99.5 20.49 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares - 0.31 - 0.31 Diluted EPS 130.2 26.45 99.5 20.18 At 31 December 2009 options over 894,000 2008: 1,955,000 shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted EPS because their exercise price was above the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, anti-dilutive.

The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs in the following reportable segments: Cost As previously stated Restated 2009 2008 2008 m m m Civil Government 509.4 548.4 546.9 Defence 257.7 280.6 280.6 Transport 21.1 21.4 21.4 Science 110.2 114.3 114.3 At 31 December 898.4 964.7 963.2 Note 15 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial plans approved by senior management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used are discussed below.
Short-term growth rates Short-term revenue growth rates used in each CGU five-year plan are based on internal data regarding the current pipeline of opportunities and published industry forecasts for the relevant market.
Short-term growth rates are tailored for each CGU taking into account the long-term contractual nature of revenues generated by the Group.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group as a whole had revenue visibility of 91% for the next 12 month period based upon the order book.
Visibility of planned 2011 and 2012 revenues are already 76% and 64% respectively.
Current identified opportunities at 31 December 2009 total 17.1bn.
Appropriate new bid and re-bid win rates are included within each CGU forecast.
Group wide, these rates are 50% and 90% respectively.
Further discussion of the Groups order book and pipeline is provided in the Our business and Our performance sections.
Terminal growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the five-year period are based upon managements estimate of the growth rates of the sectors in which the CGUs operate.
The terminal growth rates applied vary between 1.1% and 6.0%.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for the individual market sectors.
Goodwill continued Capital expenditure Forecast capital expenditure is based on past practices, expectations of revenue growth and future expected capital requirements of existing opportunities within the pipeline for each CGU.
Discount rate The underlying discount rate is based on the UK ten-year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk of the Company.
Management uses this pre-tax discount rate and adjusts for the risks specific to each of the CGUs, including consideration of: Customer type 90% of the Groups revenues are derived from government contracts and the Groups management of credit risk is disclosed in note 25 h. In preparation of the impairment reviews an additional premium is added for new, non government customers, if, in managements view, the credit risk is higher than other contracts within our portfolio.
Contract length The majority of the Groups contracts within the CGUs are long-term in nature and the average length remaining on our significant contracts is nine years.
For CGUs with contracts of a shorter duration, management consider whether it is appropriate to add a contract length premium to the base discount rate.
Acquisition A higher discount rate is applied to acquisitions to reflect any implementation risks within the acquisition business model until these entities have been fully integrated into the Group structure.
Geographic Consideration is given to the country in which a CGU operates, and an adjustment is applied if management considers that the economic risk is greater than that implicit in the base discount rate.
Technology If a CGU is reliant upon new technology implementations to secure future revenue streams, an appropriate technology premium is added to the base discount rate.
The discount rate ranges applied are disclosed below: 2009 2008 % % Civil Government 10.6 11.8 10.6 11.8 Defence 10.6 11.6 10.6 11.6 Transport 11.1 11.6 11.1 13.1 Science 10.6 11.8 10.6 11.8 Sensitivities Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill impairment review, by increasing the risk element of the discount rate, and other applicable variables for each CGU.
The following CGU impairment tests were noted: The principal CGU within the Civil Government segment is our core technology business.
The goodwill attributable to this CGU as at 31 December 2009 was 274.5m.
Due to the potential impact of the adverse market conditions currently affecting the IT sector, the Group has undertaken extensive impairment testing.
Consistent with the testing conducted for the year ended 31 December 2008, this has included adjustments to growth rates, discount rates and a reduction in significant contract wins.
None of these impairment sensitivities, either individually or combined, resulted in the carrying value of goodwill in respect of this business being reduced to the recoverable amount.
The Transport segment contains six CGUs including a CGU involved in the provision of aviation ground handling services and a CGU involved in the provision of tourist rail travel.
The goodwill attributable to the provision of aviation ground handling services is 4.8m.
As stated in the Annual Review and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008, sensitivity analysis indicated a future possible impairment if market conditions deteriorated.
During 2009, adverse market conditions have continued to prevail and the cash flow of the business is dependent upon successfully securing a number of business opportunities.
Should these not be secured, a goodwill impairment charge may be required.
The goodwill attributable to the provision of tourist rail travel is 7.7m.
At the beginning of the financial period, the fair value of goodwill was substantially in excess of the book value.
During 2009, the challenging economic environment affected the tourism industry and, to a lesser extent, the financial performance of this CGU.
While management is confident of the ability of this business to generate future cash flows in excess of goodwill, an extended period of reduced passenger yields could result in the CGU requiring a goodwill impairment charge.

During the year, the Group acquired shareholdings in two companies: a On 28 January 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Sandrunner Limited.
Net assets acquired total 0.2m purchased for consideration of 1.3m, consisting of 0.3m of cash and 1.0m in deferred consideration resulting in 1.1m of goodwill relating to future opportunities in consulting.
Sandrunner Limited is a management consultancy based in the UK.
b On 2 February 2009, the Group acquired a 50% interest in GSTS Pathology LLP GSTS from Pathology Services Limited, a subsidiary of the Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust the Trust.
GSTS provides pathology services to the Trust and various third parties.
Related net cash outflows on acquisition were 4.8m consisting of 5.5m consideration including directly attributable costs and 0.7m of cash acquired.
Goodwill of 5.1m has been recognised relating to future opportunities in pathology services.
These transactions have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Amendments to provisional fair value adjustments During December 2008, Serco acquired SI and Infovision.
Due to the proximity of the transactions to the year end, the fair values of the acquired companies assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, as disclosed in the 2008 Financial Statements, were determined provisionally.
The fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of SI and Infovision were finalised in the current year, with adjustments made to the previously published fair values.

As at 31 December 2009, trade receivables of 4.6m 2008: 2.7m were considered to be impaired.
Impairments to trade receivables are based on specific estimated irrecoverable amounts and general provisions on outstanding balances greater than a year old unless there is firm evidence that the balance is recoverable.
The amount of the provision was 3.4m as at 31 December 2009 2008: 2.7m primarily because our customers either have a sovereign credit rating being government organisations or are blue chip private sector companies.

Deferred tax Deferred income taxes are calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using local substantively enacted tax rates.
The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: As previously stated Restated 2009 2008 2008 m m m At 1 January liability asset 5.9 29.6 29.6 Income statement credit charge note 10 0.2 6.6 6.6 Acquisitions disposals - 7.1 6.7 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income 41.8 22.2 22.2 Exchange differences 2.9 -- At 31 December asset liability 39.0 6.3 5.9 Note 15 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year was as follows: Share-based Temporary payment differences and Retirement Derivative Other on assets employee benefit financial temporary intangibles benefits schemes instruments differences Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2009 restated 26.5 18.7 7.5 0.6 10.0 5.9 Charged credited to income statement 0.5 1.5 6.2 0.1 7.5 0.2 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income - 1.0 39.1 1.7 - 41.8 Exchange differences 3.4 0.4 -- 0.1 2.9 At 31 December 2009 22.6 17.8 25.4 1.0 17.4 39.0 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the previous year, as restated, was as follows: Share-based Temporary payment differences and Other on assets employee Retirement Derivative temporary intangibles benefits benefit financial differences Total Restated Restated schemes instruments Restated Restated m m m m m m At 1 January 2008 8.0 19.7 15.4 3.0 0.5 29.6 Charged credited to income statement 2.4 2.7 6.1 - 0.8 6.6 Acquisitions disposals 21.4 3.1 - 0.3 11.3 6.7 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income 5.3 6.8 16.8 3.9 - 22.2 At 31 December 2008 restated 26.5 18.7 7.5 0.6 10.0 5.9 Note 15 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 5.6m 2008: 9.7m which principally relate to unused tax losses of 26.1m 2008: 28.0m.
Losses of 1.3m expire within five years, losses of 2.1m expire within six to ten years, losses of 11.6m expire within 15 to 20 years and losses of 11.1m may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 0.4m 2008: 7.5m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

Currency swaps and interest rate swaps Measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The present value of foreign currency balances are converted at the year end exchange rate.
Forward foreign exchange contracts Measured using quoted forward exchange rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Commodity futures contracts Measured at the present value of estimated cash flows with reference to quoted forward prices for Gas Oil.
Where forward prices are not available for Gas Oil the equivalent forward price data for Brent Crude has been used as the two prices are closely related.
The classification of the fair value measurement falls into three levels, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The levels are as follows: Level 1: derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: derived from other observable market data for the assets or liabilities: and Level 3: derived from valuation techniques using data that is not based on observable market data.
Based on the above, the derivative financial instruments are considered to fall into Level 2.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
ii Movement in derivative financial instruments The fair valuation of derivative financial instruments results in a net liability of 3.3m 2008: 6.0m net asset, comprising non-current assets of 2.5m 2008: 5.6m, current assets of 1.4m 2008: 5.0m, current liabilities of 5.5m 2008: 4.2m and non-current liabilities of 1.7m 2008: 0.4m.

The Board delegates authority to the executive team to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury function acts as a service centre and operates within clearly defined guidelines and policies that are approved by the Board.
The guidelines and policies: define the financial risks to be managed: specify the objectives in managing these risks: delegate responsibilities to those managing the risks: and establish a control framework to regulate treasury activities to minimise operational risk.
25 c Credit facilities The Group maintains committed credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to maintain its ongoing operations.
The Groups main facility is a 400m revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2013.
As at 31 December 2009 drawings were US Dollar 195m.
As at 31 December 2008, the bank facility comprised of term loans of 26m and US Dollar 229m.
The Group also has facilities consisting of a 35m revolving credit facility and US Dollar 488m term loan facility, both fully drawn at 31 December 2009 and at 31 December 2008.
The 35m facility expires in December 2011, whilst the US Dollar 488m facility amortises from 2010 and expires in September 2013.
These facilities were principally raised to finance the acquisition of SI.
The banking facilities are unsecured and have financial and non-financial covenants and obligations typical of these arrangements.
The Group has outstanding private placements of 117m which amortise in equal annual instalments from 2011 to 2015.
The private placements comprise a tranche of 83m and a tranche of US Dollar 55m, which is hedged by two cross currency swaps note 25 e. 25 d Liquidity risk management The Groups financial liabilities will be settled on a net basis based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Any material transactional exposures that do arise are hedged by the Groups treasury function using forward foreign exchange contracts.
ii Translational The foreign exchange exposure on the US Dollar tranche of the private placements has been fully hedged into Sterling.
The exposure on US Dollar drawings under the bank facilities is hedged against the net investment in our US business.
Central funding of individual businesses gives rise to monetary assets and liabilities.
The currency of funding is selected to ensure that any foreign exchange risk resides with Group.
This risk is then managed by the Groups treasury function, using forward foreign exchange contracts and any natural hedge positions that may exist.
iii Forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and swap contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
These contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 15:15 Page 114 114 25 e Foreign exchange risk continued At the balance sheet date, the net total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts to which the Group is committed is 74.8m 2008: 99.7m.
These arrangements are mainly designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next six years 2008: seven years.
Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2009, the Group held a number of currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling.
The profile of these currency swaps held by the Group is as follows: Receivable Payable Receivable Payable Notional USD interest GBP interest Notional USD interest GBP interest amount rate rate amount rate rate 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 Maturity USDm %% USDm %% August 2015 35.0 5.7 5.7 35.0 5.7 5.7 August 2015 20.0 5.7 5.7 20.0 5.7 5.7 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 21.3m 2008: 52.2m.
All currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and the fair value loss of 6.2m 2008: 15.7m gain has been deferred in equity.
No balances in relation to ineffectiveness have been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except for a previously discontinued cash flow hedge.
Amounts in the hedging reserve are recycled to the income statement as the hedged transactions affect the income statement.
A loss of 0.2m 2008: 0.1m has been included in the Consolidated Income Statement, and the remaining loss of 0.4m 2008: 0.6m is expected to be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in future periods.
iv Hedges of net investments in foreign entities The Group has US Dollar denominated borrowings, some of which have been designated as a hedge of part of the net investment in its acquired subsidiaries in the US, and Euro denominated borrowings, some of which have been designated as a hedge of part of the net investment in its subsidiaries in Europe.
The carrying value of the designated borrowings was 386.2m 2008: 426.0m.
The foreign exchange gain of 47.0m 2008: 16.1m loss on translation into Sterling of the borrowings has been recognised within the Groups Hedging and translation reserve.
The hedge is highly effective.
No amounts have been recognised in the income statement.
v Currency sensitivity The Groups currency exposures that result in net currency gains and losses in the income statement and equity arise principally from US Dollar and Canadian Dollar financial instruments.
At 31 December 2009, if the US Dollar had weakened by ten per cent against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.1m lower 2008: 0.1m higher mainly as a result of movements on working capital.
Equity would have been 31.2m higher 2008: 34.8m mainly due to exchange gains on net investment hedges denominated in US Dollars.
However, this would be predominantly offset by exchange losses on the retranslation of the net assets of the US subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2009, if the US Dollar had weakened by ten per cent against the Canadian Dollar, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been unaffected 2008: 0.3m lower.
Equity would have been 0.6m higher 2008: 0.5m due to Canadian Dollar denominated non-current intercompany borrowings.
Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 15:15 Page 115 Financial Statements 115 25 f Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to hedge core borrowing requirements to protect against adverse interest rate movements.
Exposure to interest rate risk arises principally on changes to US Dollar and Sterling interest rates.
i Interest rate management An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk is set out below: Financial assets Weighted Weighted average fixed average fixed Floating Fixed interest rate Floating Fixed interest rate rate rate received rate rate received 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 m m % m m % Cash and cash equivalents 319.4 - 250.8 - Other financial assets 0.2 0.6 6.00 0.2 1.2 6.00 319.6 0.6 251.0 1.2 Financial liabilities Weighted Weighted average fixed average fixed Floating Fixed interest rate Floating Fixed interest rate rate rate paid rate rate paid 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 m m % m m % Non recourse Canadian Dollar loans - 29.0 5.27 - 34.1 5.27 Sterling loans 71.1 118.6 5.83 48.3 119.8 5.80 US Dollar loans 144.2 278.7 3.20 534.7 -- Other loans 12.2 0.1 12.00 7.5 3.3 12.59 227.5 426.4 590.5 157.2 Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated through the use of interest rate derivatives.
Excluded from the above analysis is 24.0m of amounts payable under finance leases, which are subject to fixed rates of interest 2008: 17.2m.
ii Interest rate swaps During 2009 the Group entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on US Dollar 450m of its debt by swapping floating for fixed interest rates.
The profile of the interest rate swaps is as follows: Payable USD weighted average Receivable Notional interest USD interest value rate rate 2009 2009 2009 Maturity USDm%% March 2011 150 1.60 3 month USD LIBOR March 2012 300 1.83 3 month USD LIBOR The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and are highly effective.
The fair value loss of 2.1m has therefore been deferred within equity 2008: 0.8m gain.
The gain in 2008 related to interest rate swaps held by Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited, which was sold by the Group on 23 June 2008. iii Interest rate sensitivity The following sensitivity analysis has been determined on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and on average balances held throughout the year.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a gain on post-tax profit for the year to 31 December 2009 of 0.3m 2008: 1.1m loss.
The gain on equity due to a 100 basis point movement would have been 4.3m 2008: 1.2m due to movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments held as cash flow hedges.

The profile of the commodity derivatives used by the joint ventures to reduce this risk is as follows: Payable Receivable Notional fixed floating value rate rate 2009 2009 2009 Maturity Million litres p per litre USD September 2010 9.4 33.80 0.1% NWE September 2011 44.9 28.95 0.2% NWE North West Europe price with 0.1% or 0.2% sulphur content Payable Receivable Notional fixed floating value rate rate 2008 2008 2008 Maturity Million litres p per litre USD September 2009 9.4 34.10 0.1% NWE September 2010 12.5 33.80 0.1% NWE September 2011 71.3 28.95 0.2% NWE North West Europe price with 0.1% or 0.2% sulphur content All commodity derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective.
The 2.0m gain 2008: 2.4m loss in the fair value has therefore been deferred within equity.
Price risk sensitivity An increase of US Dollar 0.2 per litre in the price of fuel at the balance sheet date would result in a 3.5m increase in equity 2008: 6.5m.
The sensitivity to changes in fuel prices resulting from changes in exchange rates is included within the currency sensitivity analysis note 25 e. 25 h Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is relatively low because a high proportion of our customers have a sovereign or sovereign-like credit rating and the Group has a large number of counterparties and customers.
External credit checks are completed for all new non Government customers before signing a contract above 100,000. Credit vetting for new Government body customers is performed by an internal review of the clients ability to pay and timeliness of payment.
The review includes a consideration of the expected contract budget as well as economic and industry factors and the budget holders position within the Government body.
At quarterly intervals, a management credit worthiness review for all ongoing customers with material outstanding balances is undertaken, including an assessment to determine if there has been any deterioration in the customers payment history and a review of the total credit authorised to the customer throughout the Group.
The Groups treasury function only transacts with counterparties that have, as a minimum, long-term public ratings from recognised credit rating agencies of at least two A ratings.
It also ensures that no exposure to any one institution at any given time exceeds a pre-approved exposure limit.
25 i Capital risk management The Groups key objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has sufficient funds to meet current and future business requirements, to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
Access to capital takes many forms and includes access to the equity market, debt capital market and bank market.
During 2009, the Group maintained sufficient debt facilities that ensured its objectives were met.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group has accounted for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group operates and is a member of a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2009, including the proportionate share of joint ventures, was 92.4m 2008: 85.9m.
26 a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK and Europe.
In addition, the Group has interests in joint ventures, which operate defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the funded plans are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
The Groups major plans are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method.
This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of salary growth, and long-term expected rates of return for plan assets.
Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Long-term expected rates of return for plan assets are based on published brokers forecasts for each category of scheme assets.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan and intends to exercise this right.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are grouped together as follows: Contract specific Virtually certain costs reimbursed The Group has an obligation to contribute to the pension scheme over the term of the contract.
At rebid any deficit or surplus would transfer to the next contractor.
Throughout the contract, it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed the expenditure required to settle the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract has been recognised as a liability.
The Group has recognised the right to reimbursement as a separate asset.
In the income statement, the expense relating to this defined benefit plan has been presented net of the amount recognised for the reimbursement, resulting in a nil charge to the income statement.
Contract specific Not certain costs reimbursed These are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts.
The Group has recognised as a liability the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contracts with a corresponding amount recognised as intangible assets at the start of the contracts.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the SOCI.
The intangible assets are amortised over the term of the contracts.
Non contract specific These consist of a pre-funded defined benefit scheme the funding policy of which is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected salary basis and an unfunded defined benefit scheme, both of which do not relate to any specific contract.
Any liabilities arising are recognised in full.

Certain of the Groups non contract specific schemes have a Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to liabilities.
The main asset classes that make up the LDI investments are gilts and corporate bonds with inflation and interest swap overlays, and the assumed expected rate of return is taken to be gilts 0.7% 2008: gilts 0.3%.

Assumptions in respect of the expected return on plan assets are based on market expectations of returns over the life of the related obligation.
Due consideration has been given to current market conditions as at 31 December 2009 in respect to inflation, interest, bond yields and equity performance when selecting the expected return on assets assumptions.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates is derived from their market value.
The yield on equity investments contains an additional premium an equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional anticipated returns of holding this type of investment, when compared to bond yields.
Management have considered the impact of the adverse changes and volatility in the equity market in 2009 and have concluded that an equity risk premium of 4.1% is appropriate at 31 December 2009 2008: 4.1%.
The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns for the principal asset categories held by scheme.

Property provisions relate to leased properties which are either under utilised or vacant and where the unavoidable costs associated with the lease exceed the economic benefits expected to be gained.
Management has calculated the provision based on the discounted cash outflows required to settle the lease obligations.
Contract provisions primarily relate to SI where, as required under IAS 37, a provision has been taken for a loss making onerous contract.
Management has used the present value of the estimated future cash outflows required to settle the contract obligations in determining the provision.
Other provisions are held for legal and other costs that the Group expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.

If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options may be forfeited if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the movement in all EOP options are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average Number exercise Number exercise of options price of options price 2009 2009 2008 2008 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 10,948 2.65 13,724 2.53 Granted during the year 88 3.88 334 4.55 Exercised during the year 3,634 2.50 2,520 2.29 Lapsed during the year 545 2.98 590 2.36 Outstanding at 31 December 6,857 2.72 10,948 2.65 Of these options, 5,992,295 2008: 9,606,125 were exercisable at the end of the year, with a weighted average exercise price of 2.48 2008: 2.46.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average contractual life of 3.66 years 2008: 4.22 years.
The exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 December 2009 ranged from 1.39 to 4.90 2008: 1.39 to 4.90.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise approximates to the weighted average share price during the year, which was 4.41 2008: 4.20.
The fair value of options granted under the EOP is measured by use of the Binomial Lattice model.
The Binomial Lattice model is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it allows exercise over a longer period of time between the vesting date and the expiry date.
Share-based payment expense continued The inputs into the Binomial Lattice model for options granted during the year are: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 395p 453p Weighted average exercise price 388p 455p Expected volatility 26.4% 27.5% Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk-free rate 2.5% 4.4% Expected dividends 1.3% 0.9% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards made to eligible employees under the above schemes are structured as options with a zero exercise price and may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant.
The extent to which an award vests and therefore becomes exercisable is measured by reference to the growth in the Groups earnings per share EPS or total shareholder return TSR over the performance period of three financial years.
Details of the movement in all LTIS and LTIP options are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average Number exercise Number exercise of options price of options price 2009 2009 2008 2008 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 8,214 Nil 7,040 Nil Granted during the year 351 Nil 2,224 Nil Exercised during the year 2,383 Nil 592 Nil Lapsed during the year 559 Nil 458 Nil Outstanding at 31 December 5,623 Nil 8,214 Nil Of these options, 896,487 2008: 1,293,356 were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average contractual life of 7.59 years 2008: 8.11 years.
During the year, two grants of LTIP options were made: one grant with TSR performance conditions, the other with EPS growth performance conditions.
The Monte Carlo Simulation model is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under schemes where there are changes in performance conditions by which the options are measured, such as for the TSR based awards.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo Simulation model for options granted during the year are: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 374p 402p Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil Expected volatility 28.9% 23.2% - 26.8% Expected life 3 years 1 - 5 years Risk-free rate 1.8% 2.5% - 5.0% Expected dividends 1.3% 0.9% - 1.1% Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 15:15 Page 127 Financial Statements 127 33.
Share-based payment expense continued Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
For the LTIP options with EPS growth performance conditions, the fair value is considered to be their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
The assumptions for options granted during the year with EPS growth performance conditions are: 2009 Weighted average share price 456p Weighted average exercise price Nil Expected volatility N A Expected life 3 years Risk-free rate N A Expected dividends 1.2% Transformational Share Scheme Awards made to eligible employees under the Transformational Share Scheme are structured as options with a nominal exercise price and are exercisable after the third anniversary of the grant.
The employee must exercise the options no later than 30 days after the vesting date.
Furthermore, if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest, the options may be forfeited.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average contractual life of 1.28 years 2008: 2.33 years.
The fair value of options granted under the Transformational Share Scheme is considered to be equal to their face value as at the grant date less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
This model is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as the options have a nil exercise price and are not subject to any performance conditions.
The assumptions for determining the face value less any dividends are: 2009 Weighted average share price 366p Weighted average exercise price Nil Expected volatility N A Expected life 2 years Risk-free rate N A Expected dividends 1.4% Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 15:15 Page 128 128 33.
Share-based payment expense continued Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, eligible employees have been granted options with a nil exercise price.
Awards vest after the performance period of three years and are subject to the achievement of two performance measures.
The primary performance measure is TSR and the secondary performance measure is based on EPS growth.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average contractual life of 9.48 years.
In the year, two grants were made with 70% of the options granted subject to TSR performance conditions and 30% subject to EPS growth performance conditions.
The options subject to TSR performance conditions were valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation model.
The options subject to EPS growth performance conditions were deemed to have fair values equal to their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo Simulation model for options granted during the year with TSR performance conditions are: 2009 Weighted average share price 406p Weighted average exercise price Nil Expected volatility 28.8% Expected life 3 years Risk-free rate 2.2% Expected dividends 1.2% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

Share-based payment expense continued Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, eligible employees are entitled to use up to 50% of their earned annual bonus to purchase shares in the Group at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for this period, the shares are retained for that period and the two performance measures which are the same as the PSP scheme, being TSR and EPS growth have been met, the Group will make a matching share award.
For shares purchased by employees in 2009 the match was on a basis of two times the gross bonus deferred.

In the year, two grants were made with 50% of the deferred bonus subject to TSR performance conditions and 50% subject to EPS growth performance conditions.
The portion subject to TSR performance conditions was valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation model.
The portion subject to EPS growth performance conditions was deemed to have a fair value equal to their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo Simulation model for options granted during the year with TSR performance conditions are: 2009 Weighted average share price 404p Weighted average exercise price Nil Expected volatility 28.9% Expected life 3 years Risk-free rate 1.8% - 2.4% Expected dividends 1.2% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

Share-based payment expense continued Sharesave 2008 The Sharesave 2008 scheme provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less ten per cent.
The options can be exercised for a period of six months following their vesting.
Details of the movement in Sharesave 2008 options are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average Number exercise Number exercise of options price of options price 2009 2009 2008 2008 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 6,760 4.0 - Nil Granted during the year - Nil 6,976 4.0 Exercised during the year 5 4.0 - Nil Lapsed during the year 649 4.0 216 4.0 Outstanding at 31 December 6,106 4.0 6,760 4.0 None of these options were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average contractual life of 2.12 years 2008: 3.12 years.
Given that options granted under the Sharesave scheme can be exercised at any time after vesting, management consider the Binomial Lattice model to be appropriate to value the options granted under this scheme.
The Binomial Lattice model allows exercise over a window in time, from vesting date to expiry date, and assumes option holders make economically rational exercise decisions.

Accounting policies continued Current tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax The charge for taxation takes account of taxation deferred because of differences between the timing of recognition of certain items for taxation purposes and for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is considered more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on a non-discounted basis using tax rates in force at the date the timing differences are expected to reverse.
