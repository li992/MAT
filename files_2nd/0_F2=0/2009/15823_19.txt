Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Groups policy in relation to financial risk management.
Details of that policy are set out in note 33 of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The carrying value of derivative financial instruments held by the Company was as follows: As at 2 January 2010 As at 3 January 2009 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities $ million $ million $ million $ million Carrying value Interest rate swaps 16.6 16.1 Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings by the Company under the Groups EMTN Programme from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
These contracts have been designated as fair value hedges in relation to the borrowings but they ceased to be effective for accounting purposes during 2009.
During 2009, the Company recognised a fair value loss of $1.4 million 2008: gain of $18.9 million in relation to these contracts and the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings was decreased by $1.1 million 2008: increased by $20.1 million to reflect the change in the fair value of the borrowings attributable to the hedged risk while the hedges were effective and the amortisation of the transitional adjustment that was recognised on adoption of FRS 26.
During 2009, a net loss of $0.3 million 2008: net loss of $1.2 million was, therefore, recognised in the profit and loss account in relation to these hedges.

Defined benefit plans The Company operates a number of funded defined benefit pension plans in the UK that provide benefits based upon final pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The plan assets are held separately from the Companys assets in funds that are under the control of trustees.
Day-to-day management of the plan assets is carried out by independent investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in the Company.
The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Company are closed to new entrants.
The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension plans were as follows: As at As at 2 January 3 January 2010 2009 % per annum % per annum Salary increases 4.50% 4.00% Increase to pensions in payment 3.50% 3.00% Increase to deferred pensions 3.50% 3.00% Long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.31% 6.31% Discount rate 5.75% 6.50% Inflation rate 3.50% 3.00% The current life expectancies underlying the value of accrued liabilities were as follows: As at As at 2 January 3 January 2010 2009 Current pensioners at age 65 male 21.5 years 21.5 years female 24.5 years 24.5 years Future pensioners at age 65 male 22.5 years 22.5 years female 25.5 years 25.5 years The fair value of the plan assets and the expected rates of return were as follows: As at 2 January 2010 As at 3 January 2009 As at 29 December 2007 Long-term Long-term Long-term expected expected expected rate of return Fair value rate of return Fair value rate of return Fair value % per annum $ million % per annum $ million % per annum $ million Equities 7.80% 108.9 8.00% 100.9 7.95% 160.0 Bonds 5.00% 139.1 5.15% 106.8 5.25% 5.75% 153.7 Other assets 4.20% 4.30% 0.6 4.85% 1.2 248.0 208.3 314.9 The actual return on plan assets was 7.7% 2008: loss of 5.1%.

The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the degree of global capital market integration.
The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward-looking views of the financial markets as revealed through the yield on longterm bonds and the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices.
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgment based on their knowledge of the Companys plans.
The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected long-term risk premiums for each asset class are developed.
The nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected inflation and real risk-free rate assumptions.
As a final consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop long-term equilibrium expectations.

The Company expects to contribute approximately $12.5 million to the defined benefit pension plans in 2010.
Defined contribution schemes The Company makes contributions to the personal pension arrangements of employees who are not eligible, or chose not, to participate in its deferred benefit plans.
Contributions payable by the Company to these arrangements amounted to $0.1 million 2008: $nil.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had not paid over to the plans contributions due amounting to $0.1 million 3 January 2009: $nil.
All amounts due for the period were paid over subsequent to the balance sheet date.
Background The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Groups senior executives and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
Although the Companys ordinary shares are denominated in US dollars, they are quoted in sterling on the London Stock Exchange.
The information provided below relates only to options and awards that were granted to persons who are employees of the Company.
Share options Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new awards in May 2005.
Awards granted under these schemes were subject to a performance condition that the rate of increase in the Groups earnings per share must exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of 2% per annum over any three-year period after the options were granted.
The final unvested options under these schemes vested during 2007.
Options continue to be granted from time to time under the Companys Sharesave Scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the UK.
It offers eligible employees the option to buy ordinary shares in Tomkins plc after a period of three, five or seven years, funded from the proceeds of a savings contract to which employees may contribute up to 250 per month.

The fair value of options granted under the Sharesave Scheme was measured at their respective grant dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula based on the following assumptions: Year ended Year ended 2 January 3 January 2010 2009 Weighted average fair value 68.20p 37.66p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 161.75p 176.75p Exercise price 96.00p 140.20p Expected volatility 33.39% 24.46% Expected life 4.42 years 4.47 years Risk-free interest rate 3.74% 4.55% Expected dividends 6.25p 13.89p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the options.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Other awards The Companys principal ongoing share-based compensation arrangements are the ABIP and the PSP.
Both are restricted to the Companys senior executives.
In 2009, the IBP was introduced as a temporary, one-year substitute for the ABIP.
The ABIP provides awards of Restricted Award Shares and Deferred Award Shares based on the bonusable profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.
Restricted Award Shares normally vest after a period of three years.
Dividends are paid on the Restricted Award Shares.
Deferred Award Shares normally vest after a period of three years, conditional on the participants continued employment with the Group.
Dividends are not paid on the Deferred Award Shares until they have vested.
During 2009, awards were granted over 173,711 ordinary shares 2008: 180,348 ordinary shares under the ABIP in relation to bonuses earned in 2008.
The IBP differs from the ABIP only in that awards made under the plan are based on the trading cash flow of the business for which the participants have responsibility and on the attainment of strategic achievement milestones that are set for each of the participants.
Awards over shares under the IBP are expected to be made in March 2010.
In 2009, an accrual of $0.4 million was recognised in respect of the Restricted Award Shares to be awarded under the IBP.
The PSP provides awards of shares which vest after a period of three years, conditional on the Groups total shareholder return relative to its cost of equity over the vesting period and the participants continued employment with the Group.
During 2009, awards were granted over 1,838,839 ordinary shares under the PSP 2008: 2,103,039 ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards made under the ABIP is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made under these schemes during the period was 130.46p 2008: 129.34p.
The fair value of awards made under the PSP was measured at their respective grant dates using the Monte Carlo valuation model based on the following assumptions: Year ended Year ended 2 January 3 January 2010 2009 Weighted average fair value 53.40p 34.20p Weighted average assumptions: Expected volatility 46.38% 37.49% Expected life 3.00 years 3.00 years Risk-free interest rate 2.17% 4.57% Dividend yield 3.88% 9.97% Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the awards.
