The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year.
As a result the value of equity is more sensitive than the value of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the resulting movement in profit before tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, and in particular interest rates, remain constant.

The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash and deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash and deposits Note 23, derivative financial instruments see above and trade and other receivables Note 11 is their carrying amount.
Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable credit rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Note 11 sets out an analysis of trade and other receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
