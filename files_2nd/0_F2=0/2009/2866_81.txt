Intangible valuations relating to this acquisition had been performed on a provisional basis and the exercise was completed in the subsequent year.
During the year deferred consideration of 9.1m was settled in respect of acquisitions made in prior years, 7.8m was paid in cash and the remainder of 1.3m through the issue of loan notes, of which 9.4m had been previously provided: the impact of this was to reduce goodwill by 0.3m.
As a result of the above total goodwill of 134.7m was recognised in the year.
Acquisitions in the year included IBS OPENSystems plc now known as IBS OPENSystems Limited, ComputerLand UK PLC now known as ComputerLand UK Limited, Lancaster Insurance Services Limited, Nieuwenhuis Services BV now known as Capita Fiduciary BV, and ABS Network Solutions Limited.
For all acquisitions in the year the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the acquired company.
Within goodwill are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquirees and could not be measured reliably.
These items include client loyalty and the assembled workforce.
The Groups acquisition in 2008 of IBS OPENSystems Limited IBS was the subject of a referral to the Competition Commission CC under Section 22 1 of the Enterprise Act 2002.
On 4 June 2009 the CC announced its decision.
The CC determined that the acquisition by the Group of IBS resulted in a lessening of competition in the market for revenue and benefits software systems and that the corrective measure required was the sale of the element of IBS that provides this product and service.
Consequently, the Group disposed of this part of the business see note 5.
