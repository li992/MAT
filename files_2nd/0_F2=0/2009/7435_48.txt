Share-based payments continued Share Incentive Plan The HMV Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP, as discussed more fully in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 27, provides share-based incentives to eligible employees.
Under the SIP, employees may acquire Ordinary Shares in three ways.
Firstly, the Company can use the SIP as part of its broad incentive arrangements by awarding free shares to employees: in this regard an award of 120 free shares was made to every eligible employee on the Initial Public Offering in May 2002.
There have not been any further awards of free shares and there are no plans to award further free shares to any employees.
Secondly, the Company may invite UK employees to purchase Ordinary Shares, known as Partnership Shares, and thirdly, the Company may, if it wishes, agree to match the shares purchased with additional shares, known as Matching Shares.
The Company has matched on a one-for-one basis since the inception of the SIP.
The charge in respect of the SIP during the year ended 25 April 2009 was 0.4m 2008: 0.4m.
