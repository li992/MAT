Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 13 Acquisitions continued The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2010 combined financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2008.
The businesses acquired in 2009 contributed 6m to revenue, 1m to adjusted operating profit, 1m to adjusted profit attributable, increased profit attributable by 1m, and contributed 2m net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a proforma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable and profit attributable for the year would have been 6,072m, 1,570m, 982m and 395m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
14 Equity dividends 2009 2008 Ordinary dividends declared in the year m m Reed Elsevier PLC 228 204 Reed Elsevier NV 232 214 Total 460 418 Ordinary dividends declared in the year, in amounts per ordinary share, comprise: a 2008 final dividend of 15.0p and a 2009 interim dividend of 5.4p giving a total of 20.4p 2008: 18.9p for Reed Elsevier PLC: and a 2008 final dividend of u0.290 and a 2009 interim dividend of u0.107 giving a total of u0.397 2008: u0.425 for Reed Elsevier NV.
The directors of Reed Elsevier PLC have proposed a final dividend of 15.0p 2008: 15.0p.
The directors of Reed Elsevier NV have proposed a final dividend of u0.293 2008: u0.290.
The total cost of funding the proposed final dividends is expected to be 360m, for which no liability has been recognised at the statement of financial position date.
2009 2008 Ordinary dividends paid and proposed relating to the financial year m m Reed Elsevier PLC 245 221 Reed Elsevier NV 250 222 Total 495 443 Dividends paid to Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV shareholders are, other than in special circumstances, equalised at the gross level inclusive of the UK tax credit of 10% received by certain Reed Elsevier PLC shareholders.
The cost of funding the Reed Elsevier PLC dividends is therefore similar to that of Reed Elsevier NV.

The aggregate distribution of 2,013m including 27m paid to the employee benefit trust was recognised when paid.
The special distributions were accompanied by consolidations of the ordinary share capitals of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV on the basis of 58 new ordinary shares for every 67 existing ordinary shares, reflecting the ratio of the aggregate special distribution to the combined market capitalisation of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV excluding the 5.8% indirect equity interest in Reed Elsevier NV held by Reed Elsevier PLC as at 12 December 2007, the date of the announcement of the special distribution.

Impairment charges comprise 93m in Reed Business Information, principally relating to its US and International businesses, which have seen a significant contraction in print advertising revenues, and 17m in Reed Exhibitions relating to deteriorating prospects for a number of minor exhibitions, principally in Reed Exhibitions Continental Europe.
Impairment review Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is performed at least annually based on cash generating units CGUs.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
CGUs which are not individually significant have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
Typically, when an acquisition is made the acquired business is fully integrated into the relevant business unit and CGU, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill recorded in the major groups of CGUs is set out below.
2009 2008 Goodwill m m Elsevier 963 1,074 LexisNexis US Legal 1,012 1,104 LexisNexis Risk Solutions 1,659 1,846 LexisNexis International 133 137 LexisNexis 2,804 3,087 Reed Exhibitions Continental Europe 304 336 Reed Exhibitions other 60 71 Reed Exhibitions 364 407 Reed Business Information US 73 162 Reed Business Information UK 69 71 Reed Business Information NL 29 33 Reed Business Information International 37 67 Reed Business Information 208 333 Total 4,339 4,901 The carrying value of each CGU is compared with its estimated value in use, which is determined to be its recoverable amount.
Value in use is calculated based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value.
Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to latest budgets and forecasts for the next five years approved by management, after which a long-term perpetuity growth rate is applied.
The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for managements estimates of future performance.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are discount rates and perpetuity growth rates.
The discount rates used are based on the Reed Elsevier weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a risk premium specific to each CGU.
The Reed Elsevier weighted average cost of capital reflects an assumed equity return, based on the risk free rate for government bonds adjusted for an equity risk premium, and the Reed Elsevier post tax cost of debt.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are 9.5% for Elsevier, 10.0-10.5% for LexisNexis, 10.5-11.0% for Reed Exhibitions and 10.5-16.0% for Reed Business Information.
Cash flows subsequent to the forecast period of five years are assumed to grow at nominal perpetuity growth rates.
The rates assumed are based on long-term historic growth rates of the territories where the CGUs operate and the growth prospects for the sectors in which the CGUs operate.
The nominal perpetuity growth rates for all CGUs do not exceed 3%.
The value in use calculations and impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in key assumptions, particularly relating to discount rates and cash flow growth.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management: an increase in the discount rate of 0.5%: a decrease in the compound annual growth rate CAGR for adjusted operating cash flow in the five year forecast period of between 2.0% and 5.0%, depending on the CGU: and a decrease in perpetuity growth rates of 0.5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairments would result under each of the sensitivity scenarios other than in the case of a 5.0% decline in adjusted operating cash flow CAGR over the five year forecast period which, if applied across all CGUs, would result in an impairment of 111m.
