Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 1 July 2009.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene King Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasisubsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated, from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the one exception noted below.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction became effective during the financial year.
The application of this interpretation by the group has had no impact on the groups financial statements.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the assets including previously unrecognised intangible assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated at business segment level which is the lowest group of cash generating units where goodwill is monitored by management.
Allocation is based on expectations of where benets from the synergies of the combination will result.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year-end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benets are expected from its use.
profit or loss on fide-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is included in the income statement in the year of fide-recognition.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identiable cash inows independent of the cash inows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated using the identied cash ows of the asset groups.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 15.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of a business segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the business segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method and are not capitalised.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash ows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets Financial assets are classied as either financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Other information Management and governance Financial statements and notes Business review Overview Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate uctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classied as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash ow hedging the variability in cash ows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash ow hedges.
Cash ow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Pensions and other post-employment benets Dened benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benets under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the group income statement.
The dened benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations, less past service costs not yet recognised, and less the fair value of scheme assets.
Dened benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Dened contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups dened contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benets to employees which are unfunded.
The cost of providing these benets is determined on the same basis as the dened benefit pension schemes.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions, other than market conditions.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market related conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share gures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty.
Revenue principally consists of: Goods Drink and food sales Recognised at the point at which goods are provided either wholesale or in the groups outlets.
Services Accommodation sales Recognised at the point at which the services are provided.
Rental income Recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income Net takings recognised as earned.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benets of ownership are classied as operating leases.
Lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Other information Management and governance Financial statements and notes Business review Overview Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are dened as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied A number of standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: IFRS 8 Operating segments effective 1 January 2009 The standard replaced IAS 14, with revised requirements for the identication, measurement and disclosure of segment information.
IAS 1 revised Presentation of financial statements effective 1 January 2009 The amendment to the standard will require the company to choose whether to rename the primary statements and whether to present the new statement of comprehensive income as a single statement replacing the income statement or as two statements.
IAS 23 Borrowings costs effective 1 January 2009 The revised standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to an asset that necessarily takes a substantial amount of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payments effective 1 January 2009 The amendment claries the denition of vesting conditions and the accounting treatment of cancellations by the counterparty to share-based payment agreements.
Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial instruments disclosure The amendment enhances the disclosures relating to fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
In addition, the following standards and interpretations have been issued, none of which are anticipated to signicantly impact the groups results or assets and liabilities and are not expected to require additional disclosure: IFRS 3 Business combinations revised January 2008 effective 1 July 2009 IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements revised January 2008 effective 1 July 2009 IAS 13 Customer loyalty programmes effective 1 July 2008 GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 1 Accounting policies continued significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating unit that the assets are grouped within.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash ows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash ows.
Note 15 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 14.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
If the actual cash ows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful economic lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be nally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benets are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share-based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition, estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, and judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plan.

The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2009 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 502p 560p 438p Exercise price 560p 341p Expected dividend yield 4.3% 4.3% 4.3% Risk-free rate of return 3.1% 4.5% 1.7% Volatility 38.5% 26.2% 44.6% Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 416p 66p 110p 2008 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 808p 1087p 694p Exercise price 1087p 519p Expected dividend yield 4.9% 4.9% 4.9% Risk-free rate of return 4.6% 5.5% 4.1% Volatility 25.3% 18.9% 27.6% Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 698p 289p 189p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
The SIP shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
As such, this is their fair value and the assumptions stated above are not relevant for this scheme.
Movement in outstanding options and rights during the period is as follows: Weighted average Number of options exercise price 2009 2008 2009 2008 ESOS m m p p Outstanding at the beginning of the period 3.9 3.5 755 622 Granted 1.4 1.1 560 1,087 Forfeited 0.4 0.3 715 759 Exercised 0.1 0.4 492 501 Outstanding at the end of the period 4.8 3.9 703 755 Exercisable at the end of the period 1.5 1.0 528 446 Balance at the beginning of the period includes 0.3m 2008: 0.3m shares under options granted pre- 7 November 2002 and 0.3m 2008: 0.3m at the end of period.

Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 0.7m 2008: 0.2m dilutive potential shares under option, giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 134.4m 2008: 138.5m.
Where the average share price during the year is lower than the option price or the performance conditions of the option had not been met or were not expected to be met the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of options where the average share price was lower than the option price was 2.6m 2008: 3.4m, the number of options that were anti-dilutive as a result of performance conditions not being met was 2.5m 2008: 0.9m.
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group on both a basic and dilutive basis.

GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 13 Goodwill m Cost At 29 April 2007 607.7 Acquired through business combinations note 18 68.3 Adjustments to carrying value of goodwill in respect of utilisation of tax losses 2.2 At 4 May 2008 and 3 May 2009 673.8 All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
The adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill in the prior year were due to the post-acquisition utilisation of tax losses, which were not recognised as deferred tax assets following the acquisition of Laurel during 2004 05.
14 Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to business segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benets of acquisitions ow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 236.4m 2008: 236.4m to Retail, 172.3m 2008: 172.3m to Pub Partners, 138.7m 2008: 138.7m to Brewing Company, and 126.4m 2008: 126.4m to Belhaven.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for all business segments are: the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash ow projections of 9.0% 2008: 9.0%, which is based on the groups weighted average cost of capital and is used as an approximation for the risk adjusted cost of capital of the relevant business segment: and the projected cash ows beyond the one year budgets are extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2.0% 2008: 2.0% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for pre-tax discount rate and growth rate.
Neither a 1% decrease in assumed growth rate nor a 1% increase in the discount rate applied would have led to an impairment of goodwill in the current period.

A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,475.3m 2008: 1,287.1m over which there is a first charge in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 15 Property, plant and equipment continued Future capital expenditure 2009 2008 m m Contracted for 3.6 4.8 Impairment of property plant and equipment During the year 53.5m of impairment losses 2008: nil were recognised in the income statement as exceptional costs.
These are analysed between the groups principal reporting segments as shown below: 2009 2008 m m Retail 30.0 Pub Partners 15.5 Belhaven 5.0 Corporate 3.0 53.5 The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash generating unit CGU.
Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
When indicators of impairment are identied the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
The group estimates value-in-use using a discounted cash ow model.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash ow projections of 9% 2008: 9% and the projected cash ows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% 2008: 2% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of medium term trading prospects.
The impairment recognised in the Retail, Pub Partners and Belhaven estates is primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site specic trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment seen in the year.
The impairment losses recognised within the Corporate estate is primarily as a result of the reduction in the fair value less costs to sell off unlicensed properties acquired as part of business combinations in previous years.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash ow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used to calculate cash ow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Increased decreased impairment resulting from a 1% change to discount rate: 1% increase 1% decrease m m Retail 4.3 4.7 Pub Partners 3.4 2.6 Belhaven 2.0 1.4 Corporate 9.7 8.7 Increased decreased impairment resulting from a 1% change to growth rate: 1% increase 1% decrease m m Retail 2.4 2.4 Pub Partners 1.3 1.7 Belhaven 0.8 1.1 Corporate 4.5 5.2 GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Other information Management and governance Financial statements and notes Business review Overview Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 16 Financial assets non-current 2009 2008 m m Trade loans net of provision 39.0 33.8 Investments 1.3 1.0 40.3 34.8 Trade loans are net of provisions of 4.7m 2008: 3.9m, which represents the totality of impaired debt.
During the year 1.2m 2008: 0.2m of the provision was utilised and 2.0m 2008: 0.5m of new provision created.
All trade loans, net of any provision recognised, are considered to be neither past due nor impaired.
Trade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income.
The xed rate trade loans amounted to 28.4m 2008: 27.4m and variable rate trade loans amounted to 15.3m 2008: 10.3m.
Included in xed rate loans are 14.1m of loans with settlement related to purchase levels 2008: 13.3m.
The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the write-down.
The xed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 1.91% 2008: 2.24% and a weighted average period of 6.69 years 2008: 6.72 years.

The group acquired 100% of Loch Fyne Restaurants Limiteds share capital on 7 August 2007.
The group also acquired 100% of the share capital of New Century Inns Limited, a tenanted pub estate, on 14 November 2007.

In respect of Loch Fyne the goodwill also recognises the proven ability of management to grow the business.
The main fair value adjustments relate to the revaluation of the freehold and leasehold properties acquired, recognition of related deferred tax liability on these revaluations and, in relation to Loch Fyne, the reversal of goodwill on previous business combinations.
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review that was carried out by qualied surveyors employed by the company.
Retained properties have been revalued at their existing use value and properties subsequently disposed have been valued at their fair value less costs to sell.
The value of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
The net cash ow impact of the acquisitions was: 2009 2008 m m Cash paid 35.5 Net cash acquired 1.3 Net cash outflow 34.2 From the date of acquisition to 4 May 2008 Loch Fyne contributed 3.4m operating profit and 13.3m net cash outows to the groups results.
From the date of acquisition to 4 May 2008 the New Century Inns business contributed operating profits of 1.1m.
Following the integration of the New Century Inns business, it is no longer practical to identify the related cash ows separately.

Interest payable is mainly settled monthly, quarterly or semi-annually throughout the year, in accordance with the terms of the related financial instrument.
The group has facilities of 25.0m 2008: 35m available with interest linked to base rate.
Bank loans unsecured The group has a five-year revolving credit facility, signed on 26 April 2008 and amended on 30 June 2008, of 400m 2008: 550m, of which 245m 2008: 480m was drawn at the year end.
The amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although the individual draw downs are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 400m facility until April 2012.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
The interest rate for the 245.0m drawn down is 4.25%, after the effect of swaps.
The xed rate loan was repaid during the year.
Securitised debt On 7 March 2005, 600m of bonds were issued in connection with the securitisation of 904 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities and pay related issue costs.
On 8 May 2006, a further 550m of bonds were issued as a tap of the original securitisation, involving an additional 801 of the groups pubs, held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities, pay related issue costs of 4.3m and early redemption of the debentures, incurring an accelerated interest cost of 0.7m, debenture redemption costs of 4.0m, and swap termination costs of 4.7m.
On 30 June 2008, a further 350m of bonds were issued as a tap of the original securitisation, increasing the number of pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited to 2,035.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities.

GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Other information Management and governance Financial statements and notes Business review Overview Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 23 Borrowings continued Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, within the date ranges shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the oating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
Loan notes unsecured The group issued loan notes during 2007 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition.
These have a maturity date of September 2011 and bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semi-annually.
The effective interest rate of the loan notes is 4.58% 2008: 4.57% after taking into consideration the effect of interest rate swaps.
These loan notes are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classied as current debt.
During 2008 the group issued 14.4m of loan notes with a maturity date of August 2009 in connection with the Loch Fyne acquisition.
At the year-end 0.3m 2008: 0.6m of these loan notes remained outstanding and attracted interest at margin below LIBOR.
Interest is payable on repayment of the loan notes.
24 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and short-term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and nancing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash ow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity prole and cash ows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of xed and oating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate uctuations primarily arising from the oating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash ow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of xed to oating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 3 May 2009 and 4 May 2008.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move.
Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
Cash ow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year-end.
An explanation for the split between those hedges that were effective at the year-end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash ow hedging note.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax by approximately 4.5m 2008: 0.5m and the groups equity by 93.2m 2008: 51.3m.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 24 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
The groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and exibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2008: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities xed at no more than one month.
Short-term exibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity prole of the groups financial liabilities at 3 May 2009 and 4 May 2008 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.

Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans, cash, and certain derivative instruments.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Other information Management and governance Financial statements and notes Business review Overview Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2009 24 Financial instruments continued Cash ow hedging At 3 May 2009, the group held four 2008: nine interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of 198.0m 2008: 410.0m, designated as hedges of the cash ow interest rate risk of 198.0m 2008: 410.0m of the groups variable rate borrowings excluding bonds, and which are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 15.1m 2008: 1.0m.
The cash ows occur quarterly, semi-annually or monthly, receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or LIBOR, which ranged from 4.58% to 5.79% 2008: 4.50% to 5.67%, and paying a xed rate ranging from 4.50% to 5.79% 2008: 4.53% to 5.85%.
Remaining contract maturity dates range from June 2009 to October 2011.
At 3 May 2009, the group also held three 2008: two interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 763.1m 2008: 435.0m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation tap.
A fair value net liability of 129.4m 2008: 4.5m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash ow hedges against 763.1m 2008: 435.0m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average xed rate of 5.091% 2008: 4.947%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash ow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
As a result of the post year-end rights issue and subsequent debt repurchase, described in note 31, the cash ow hedges in respect of 148.0m of the groups variable rate borrowings and 22.4m of the securitised debt will cease to be effective.
Accordingly an exceptional cost of 12.1m 2008: nil has been recognised in respect of the fair value of these interest rate swaps no longer qualifying for hedge accounting.
The three ineffective swaps have been cancelled since the year end.
The remaining interest rate swaps have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
The net unrealised loss of 126.8m 2008: 11.3m in respect of effective interest rate swaps was included in equity in respect of these contracts.
Losses recycled to the income statement in respect of swap terminations amounted to 5.3m 2008: 8.1m gain and are included within pre-exceptional finance costs.
The percentage of debt that was xed as at the year-end was 97.5% 2008: 96.8% in line with the groups policy of xing at least 95% of all debt.

Carrying values are stated net of any deferred finance fees which amounted to 16.3m 2008: 10.7m.
The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from book value.
Capital risk management The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost of capital WACC and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels together referred to as capital, as appropriate in the light of economic and trading conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including xed charged cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash ow debt service coverage.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance costs before exceptional items note 7.
For the period to 3 May 2009, interest cover was 2.2x 2008: 2.5x.
