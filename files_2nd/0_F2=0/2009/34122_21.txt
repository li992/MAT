Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 March 2009 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Big Yellow Group PLC is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is 2 The Deans, Bridge Road, Bagshot, Surrey, GU19 5AT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Business Review on pages 12 to 19.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the Group has adopted IAS 23 revised Borrowing Costs.
The prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy.
The impact on the current and prior periods is shown in the table below: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement Decrease in interest payable 1,924 1,691 Increase decrease in revaluation deficit surplus 1,810 910 Decrease increase in loss profit after tax 114 781 Balance sheet Increase in development assets 895 781 Increase in net assets 895 781 Impact on earnings per share Decrease increase in loss earnings per share basic 0.10p 0.68p Decrease increase in loss earnings per share diluted 0.10p 0.67p In the current year, two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are: IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-Cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers Improvements to IFRSs 2008 : IAS 1, IAS 18, IAS 27, IAS 28, IAS 29, IAS 31, IAS 32, IAS 36, IAS 40, IAS 41, IFRS 1.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for an amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property Improvements to IFRSs May 2008.
Investment property in the course of construction will be recognised in investment property and measured at fair value.
Currently investment property in the course of construction is included in development property.
It is not possible to quantify at present the impact that this is expected to have on the Groups financial statements when the amendment is adopted.
Development property is carried at cost less provision for impairment, and is not fair valued.
The Group is not able to predict the future fair values of these assets.
Basis of accounting The annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 that are applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee, as adopted by the European Union, relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2008.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis except that investment properties and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
56 Big Yellow Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2009 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on pages 12 to 23 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes in the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Operating and Financial Review.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2010 and projections contained in the longer term business plan.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment, the shortage of credit available in the bank finance market in particular and the other principal risks to the Groups performance.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Other than the adoption of IAS 23 Revised as described earlier, the principal accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements in the current and preceding year.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Big Yellow Group PLC and all of its subsidiaries at the year end using acquisition accounting principles.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investment in subsidiaries These are recognised at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see below.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Big Yellow57 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2009 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and any applicable value added tax.
Income is recognised over the period for which the storage unit is occupied by the customer.
The Group recognises non-storage income over the period in which it is earned.
The Group recognises investment income over the period in which it is earned.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Management fees earned are recognised over the period for which the services are provided.
Franchise fees are recognised in the income statement as they fall contractually due to the Group.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, unless the costs are incurred as part of the development of a qualifying asset, when they will be capitalised.
Commencement of capitalisation is the date when the Group incurs expenditure for the qualifying asset, incurs borrowing costs and undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
In the case of suspension of activities during extended periods, the Group suspends capitalisation.
The Group ceases capitalisation of borrowing costs when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Operating loss profit Operating loss profit is stated after gains and losses on non-current assets, movements on the revaluation of investment properties and before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Plant, equipment & owner occupied property All property, plant and equipment, not classified as investment or development property, are carried at historic cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Freehold improvements 20 years Leasehold improvements Over period of the lease Plant and machinery 10 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Computer equipment 3 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Investment property The criterion used to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is to consider whether the property is held for rental income and for capital appreciation.
Where this is the case, the Group recognises these owned or leased properties as investment properties.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
In accordance with IAS40, investment property held leasehold is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Leasehold properties that are leased under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception, and is shown within note 13a.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the outstanding lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Development property Properties and land under development are recognised at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
The assets are transferred to investment properties once the store has opened to customers.
Any gains and losses on development property are recognised through the income statement.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use ie the net present value of its future cash flows discounted at the Groups average pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risk for the asset.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and the hedging of interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Big Yellow59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2009 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Financial instruments continued B Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
C Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
D Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximates to the fair value.
E Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
F Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
G Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
H Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Retirement benefit costs Pension costs represent contributions payable to defined contribution schemes and are charged to as an expense to the income statement as they fall due.
The assets of which are held separately from those of the Group.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a Estimate of Fair Value of Investment Properties The Group values its self storage centres using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
The Group employs expert external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP, who report on the values of the Groups stores on a biannual basis.
Principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: the absorption period to these stabilised levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties is set out in note 14 to the accounts.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued b Development Property The Groups development properties are held in the balance sheet at historic cost and are not valued externally.
In acquiring sites for redevelopment into self storage facilities, the Group estimates and makes judgements on the potential net lettable storage space that it can achieve in its planning negotiations, together with the time it will take to achieve maturity occupancy level.
In addition, assumptions are made on the storage rent that can be achieved at the store by comparing with other stores within the portfolio and within the local area.
These judgements taken together with estimates of operating costs and the projected construction cost, allow the Group to calculate the potential net operating income at maturity, projected returns on capital invested and hence to support the purchase price of the site at acquisition.
Following the acquisition, regular reviews are carried out taking into account the status of planning negotiations, revised construction costs or capacity of the new facility, for example, to make an assessment of the carrying value of the development property at historic cost.
Once a store is opened, then it is valued as an investment property in the Groups balance sheet and transferred from development properties.
The Group reviews all development property assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage accommodation and related services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage accommodation and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom, with the exception of 150,000 of income which arose in the Emirate of Dubai 2008: 100,000 of income which arose in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

On 15 January 2007, the Group converted to a REIT.
As a result the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
On entering the REIT regime a conversion charge equal to 2% of the aggregate market value of the properties associated with the qualifying rental business was paid.
The Group monitors its compliance with the REIT conditions.
There have been no breaches of the conditions to date.

The asset is tested bi-annually for impairment.
The carrying value of 1,433,000 remains unchanged from the prior year as there is considered to be no impairment in the value of the asset.
d Assets classified as held for sale The Group has land at one site with a total historic cost of 4 million, which is carried at 3.2 million, after a provision for impairment in the current year of 0.8 million against the site.
Land at this site is surplus to requirements and the Group is currently marketing the asset for sale: it is ready for sale and completion is expected within the next 12 months.
At 31 March 2008 the assets classified as held for sale were 16.3 million, comprised of cost of 18.0 million and an impairment of 1.7 million.
Of this balance 2.9 million has been sold during the year, and 9.4 million was transferred back to development property, as the land no longer met the criteria required to be held for sale.

The valuation has been carried out in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards, 6th Edition as amended published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the Red Book.
The valuation of each of the trading properties has been prepared on the basis of Market Value as a fully equipped operational entity, having regard to trading potential.
The valuation has been provided for accounts purposes and as such, is a Regulated Purpose Valuation as defined in the Red Book.
In compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Red Book, C&W have confirmed that: The members of the RICS who have been the signatories to the valuations provided to the Group for the same purposes as this valuation have done so since September 2004.
C&W have been carrying out this bi-annual valuation for the same purposes as this valuation on behalf of the Group since September 2004.
C&W do not provide other significant professional or agency services to the Group.
In relation to the preceding financial year of C&W, the proportion of the total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the firm is less than 5%.
Market uncertainty C&Ws valuation report comments on valuation uncertainty resulting from exceptional volatility in the financial markets and a lack of transactions in the property investment market.
C&W note that although there were a number of self storage transactions in 2007, the only significant transaction in the past 18 months was the sale of a 51% share in Shurgard Europe which was announced in January and completed on 31 March 2008.
C&W observe that in order to provide a rational opinion of value at the present time it is necessary to assume that the property market will continue to trade in an orderly fashion.
Accordingly, they have assumed that the self storage sector will continue to perform in a way not greatly different from that being anticipated prior to the credit crunch, however they have reflected negative sentiment in their capitalisation rates and they have reflected current trading conditions in their cash flow projections for each property.
C&W state that there is therefore greater uncertainty attached to their opinion of value than would be anticipated during more normal market conditions.
70 Big Yellow Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2009 14.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold and long leasehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge of 6% of the estimated annual revenue subject to a cap and a collar.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming straight line absorption from day one actual occupancy to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 50 stores both freeholds and leaseholds averages 85.04% 2008: 85.80%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
C. The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
For the 50 stores, the weighted average net stabilised yield of the net cash flow projection is 8.64% 2008: 7.67%.
D. The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 11.41% 2008: 10.36%.
E. Purchasers costs of 5.75% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 6.75% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
Short leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the Groups seven short leasehold properties is 16.8 years March 2008: seven short leaseholds is 17.8 years.
Prudent lotting C&W have assessed the value of each property individually.
However, with regard to six recently opened loss making stores three wholly owned and three in the Partnership C&W have prepared their valuation on the assumption that were these properties to be brought to the market then they would be lotted or grouped for sale with other more mature assets of a similar type owned by the Company in such a manner as would most likely be adopted in the case of an actual sale of the interests valued.
This lotting assumption has been made in order to alleviate the issue of negative short term cashflow.
C&W have not assumed that the entire portfolio of properties owned by the Group would be sold as a single lot and the value for the whole portfolio in the context of a sale as a single lot may differ significantly from the aggregate of the individual values for each property in the portfolio, reflecting prudent lotting as described above.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.75% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
We therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2009 of 767,220,000 32,660,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements or 27.5 pence per share.
This includes 500,000 as the share of uplift within Big Yellow Limited Partnership.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 12.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 000 000 Trade receivables 1,546 1,604 Other receivables 154 483 Prepayments and accrued income 6,662 5,378 8,362 7,465 Trade receivables are net of a bad debt provision of 21,000 2008: 4,000.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
All customers are required to pay in advance of the storage period.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that all customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between 1 weeks to 4 weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 155,000 2008: 167,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group holds a right of lien over the customers goods if these debts are not paid.
The average age of these receivables is 25 days past due 2008: 29 days past due.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 22.
The Groups banking facilities require hedging of 70% of the funds drawn under the investment tranche of its core banking facility.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Debt 311,339 284,000 Cash and cash equivalents 3,222 1,671 Net debt 308,117 282,329 Balance sheet equity 502,317 580,105 Net debt to equity ratio 61.3% 48.7% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 18.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on its existing store portfolio.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged in the Group and in Big Yellow Limited Partnership through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
Big Yellow73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2009 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group has two interest rate derivatives in place: 120 million fixed at 2.99% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2015 and 70 million fixed at 3.93% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2013.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
The loss in the income statement for the year of these interest rate swaps was 3,075,000 2008: loss of 3,382,000.
A further income statement charge arose in the year of 14,892,000 in respect of the fair value movement of derivative positions that were closed out in March 2009.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2009 was a liability of 5,550,000 2008: liability of 2,870,000.
D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2009, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual loss before tax by 1,213,000 2008: reduced profit before tax by 947,000 and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have reduced the Groups annual loss before tax by 1,213,000 2008: increased profit before tax by 1,440,000.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 18 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 15.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 28,500 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
H. Financial maturity analysis In respect of interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table provides a maturity analysis for individual elements.
