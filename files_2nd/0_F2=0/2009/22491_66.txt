The effective tax rate for the period is above the UK corporation tax rate of 28% due to goodwill impairment, other disallowable expenditure and a reduction in the deferred tax asset relating to employee benefits.
These effects are offset by the inclusion of the share of profit of associates in the Consolidated Income Statement on an after tax basis in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements and by the net lower tax rates applied to profits arising outside the UK.
UK corporation tax remained at 28% for the year ended 31 July 2009.
The weighted average UK corporation tax rate for the year ended 31 July 2008 was 29.3%, being 30% for the eight months to 31 March 2008 and 28% for the four months to 31 July 2008.
