Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Group and Company financial statements of Cranswick plc the Company for the year ended 31 March 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2009 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by M Davey and J Lindop.
Cranswick plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the Company are set out in note 2.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of Cranswick plc, both consolidated and company, have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied throughout the year and the preceding year, is as follows: Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Cranswick plc and its subsidiaries.
The results of undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Share based payments Note 24 measurement of share based payments Goodwill Note 13 measurement of the recoverable amount of cash generating units containing goodwill Provisions Note 21 provisions Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 46 Foreign currencies In the accounts of the Groups companies, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on both individual foreign currency transactions during the year and monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the income statement.
On consolidation, the income statements of the overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the year and the balance sheets at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The exchange differences arising as a result of translating income statements at weighted average rates and restating opening net assets at closing rates are taken to the translation reserve and the gain or loss on disposal of an overseas subsidiary is calculated after taking into account cumulative exchange gains or losses in respect of that subsidiary.
Cumulative exchange differences at the date of transition to IFRS were deemed to be nil.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue and any associated costs can be measured reliably.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer on despatch and represents the value of sales to customers net of discounts, similar allowances and estimates of returns and excludes value added tax.
Intangible assets Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
When an entity is disposed of, any goodwill associated with it is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal except that goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 2004 which was previously deducted from equity is not recycled through the income statement.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised at fair value separately from goodwill only if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and the future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: i except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised: i except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 47 and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on property, plant and equipment on the depreciable amount, being cost less the estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual parts.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold improvements Residue of lease Plant and equipment 5 - 11 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment individually or at the cash generating unit level when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Capitalised borrowing costs Borrowing costs incurred in financing the construction of qualifying assets such as property, plant and equipment are capitalised up to the date at which the relevant asset is substantially complete.
Borrowing costs are calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing during the period of capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.
Accounting for leases i Finance leases Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, in Property, plant and equipment and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in Borrowings.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the term of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remainder of the capital amount outstanding.
ii Operating leases Leases, which are not finance leases, are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Government grants and contributions UK Regional Development Grants and grants receivable from the European Union and DEFRA in respect of property, plant and equipment are credited to deferred income and released to the income statement over the relevant depreciation period.
Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 48 Inventories Inventories, with the exception of biological assets tropical marine fish, are stated at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
In the case of finished goods, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing fixed and variable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Biological assets Biological assets are included in the balance sheet at fair value less estimated point of sale costs.
Gains and losses are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as cash at bank and in hand including short term deposits with original maturity within 3 months.
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments i Debt instruments, including bank borrowings Debt instruments are initially recognised at the fair value of net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs.
Subsequently debt instruments are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Issue costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount under the effective interest method.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its cash flow risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with a similar maturity profile.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Where derivatives meet the hedging criteria under IAS 39 for cash flow hedges the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Gains or losses recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the net profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the period.
Employee benefits i Pensions The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for employees under which contributions are paid into schemes managed by major insurance companies.
Contributions are calculated as a percentage of employees earnings and obligations for contributions to the schemes are recognised as cost of sales or operating expenses in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii Equity settled share based payments The Group operates a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted to Group employees SAYE scheme.
The Group reflects in the income statement the cost of share based payments granted to its own employees.
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 which had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
In addition, the Group operates an Executive share option scheme and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Senior Executives.
Share options issued are exercisable subject to the attainment of certain market based and non-market based performance criteria.
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 which had not vested prior to 1 January Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 49 2005, is calculated using mathematical models, including the Black-Scholes model, modified for the impact of market based performance criteria and the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The Company and Group re-assesses its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date as a result of changes in the expectation of achievement of non-market based performance conditions.
Any adjustments to the original estimates are recognised in the income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
In the consolidated income statement for the reporting period, and for the comparable period of the previous year, income and expenses from discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing income and expenses down to the level of profit after taxes, even when the Group retains a non-controlling interest in the subsidiary after the sale.
The resulting profit or loss after taxes is reported separately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not depreciated.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the reporting entity and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Dividends Dividends receivable by the Company are recognised in the income statement if they are declared, appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity paying the dividend, prior to the balance sheet date.
Dividends payable by the Company are recognised when declared and therefore final dividends proposed after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid to Shareholders are shown as a movement in equity rather than on the face of the income statement.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
New standards and interpretations applied The Group has adopted the following new IFRIC interpretations during the year.
Adoption of these interpretations did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirement and their Interaction New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.

Discontinued operations On 17 April 2009, the Board announced its decision to dispose of the trade and certain assets and liabilities of the Groups Pet Division for an initial consideration of 17.0 million.
There is a mechanism in place to normalise working capital through a cash adjustment.
Cranswick plc will retain a 5.5 per cent share in the business going forward.
The Pet Division manufactures and sells bird food and also imports and sells tropical marine fish and related products.
The disposal was completed on 24 April 2009 and the final gain or loss on disposal will be recognised in the income statement in 2010.
As at 31 March 2009 the assets of the Pet Division that are being disposed of were classified as held for resale and the assets and liabilities of the division are carried at their fair value.
The loss on reclassification to held for resale has been recognised in the income statement in the current year.
The results of the Pet Division for 2009 and 2008 are presented below: 2009 2008 000 000 Revenue 46,491 39,665 Expenses 44,182 37,780 Operating profit 2,309 1,885 Exceptional gain on sale of property, plant and equipment - 792 Finance cost 271 320 Loss recognised on remeasurement to fair value 2,544 - Loss profit before tax from discontinued operations 506 2,357 Tax credit expense 820 525 Profit for the year from discontinued operations 314 1,832 The tax credit expense is analysed as follows: On profit on ordinary activities for the year 607 287 Exceptional charge on abolition of IBAs 541 - On exceptional gain on sale of property, plant and equipment - 238 On reclassification to assets held for resale 1,968 - 820 525 The cash flow impact of exceptional items is nil 2008 - 1,522,000 received in relation to asset disposals after associated costs.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to members of the parent company of 18,988,000 2008 - 25,605,000 by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share amounts, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The Group discloses in its consolidated income statement as exceptional items those material items which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Accordingly, basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented on this basis using the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table below: 2009 2008 Thousands Thousands Basic weighted average number of shares 46,099 45,832 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 127 286 46,226 46,118 Basic weighted average number of shares for 2009 excludes 195,000 shares 2008 195,000 shares held during the year by the Cranswick plc Employee Benefit Trust.
Intangible fixed assets Group Goodwill 000 Cost At 31 March 2007 117,520 Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings 236 At 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 117,756 Impairments as at 31 March 2007, 2008 and 2009 - Net book amounts at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 117,756 In August 2008, the Group increased its investment in Cranswick Gourmet Bacon Company Ltd from 85 per cent to 100 per cent for a cash consideration of 38,000 and loan notes of 336,000.
Goodwill arising from this amounted to 219,000.
The Group has no other intangible assets.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following principal cash-generating units: Cash generating unit 2009 2008 000 000 Cooked meats 86,903 86,903 Sandwiches 16,526 16,526 Continental Fine Foods 10,968 10,968 Other 3,359 3,359 117,756 117,756 Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 61 Assumptions used The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit has been determined based on value in use calculations using annual budgets for each business for the following year, approved by the Board of Directors, and cash flow projections for the next four years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure is included from budgets and thereafter is assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows are forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of between 4 and 5 per cent derived from third party market information.
A discount rate of 9.3 per cent has been used 2008 - 9.1 per cent being managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The calculation is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Sales volumes Gross margin Discount rate Sales volumes are influenced by the growth of the underlying food segment, the market shares of our customers, selling prices, and the quality of our products and service.
Historical volumes are used as the base and adjusted over the projection period in line with current growth rates.
Gross margin depends upon average selling prices, the cost of raw materials and changes in the cost of production overheads.
Historical margins are used as the base, adjusted for managements expectations derived from experience.
All calculations of this nature are sensitive to the discount rate used.
Managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital has been used for each cash generating unit.
Management believes that currently the assumptions used are unlikely to change to an extent which would reduce value in use below the value of the recoverable amount.
Assumptions and projections are updated on an annual basis.
The cost of freehold land and buildings includes 935,000 2008 - 935,000 in respect of capitalised interest.
nil of interest, which was the whole amount eligible, was capitalised during the year 2008 - 397,000.

The proportion of the Groups net assets denominated in foreign currencies is immaterial.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 70 Credit risk The Group makes a significant proportion of its sales to the major UK supermarket groups, which correspondingly represent a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables at any one time.
Based on the financial strength of these customers, the Directors do not consider that the Group faces a significant credit risk in this regard.
All cash financial assets are held by UK financial institutions, with the exception of 297,000 held in euros with a Portugese bank.
The maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.
Fair value is determined by reference to market prices where an active market exists or from discounting future cash flows based on market yield curves.
All derivative financial instruments are shown on the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair value of floating rate assets and liabilities is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
Details of these financial assets and liabilities are included in notes 17 and 19.
Hedges Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
The Group hedges two types of cash flows: i Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases The Group hedges a proportion of its near-term expected purchases denominated in overseas currencies.
Where these hedges meet the hedge criteria of IAS 39 changes in fair value are posted directly to equity and subsequently recycled through the income statement at the time that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Group Amount Maturities Exchange rates Fair value 000 euros 6,500,000 1 April 2009 to 15 July 2009 1.22 1.47 139 These contracts were effective cash flow hedges under the criteria set out in IAS 39 and therefore these fair value gains were recognised directly in equity.
The Company does not hold any forward contracts.
ii Interest rate swaps The Group hedges a proportion of the interest cash flows payable in respect of bank loans.
Interest rate swap 1 note 18 Under the terms of this interest rate swap relating to the Groups previous bank facilities, which have now been repaid the Group receives LIBOR interest and pays fixed interest of 4.98 per cent.
The swap was an ineffective cash flow hedge under the criteria set out in IAS 39 and therefore movements in fair value have been posted to the income statement.
Interest rate swap 2 note 18 Under the terms of this interest rate swap relating to the Groups new bank facilities the Group receives LIBOR interest and pays fixed interest of 2.04 per cent.
The swap was an effective cash flow hedge under the criteria set out in IAS 39 and therefore movements in fair value have been posted directly to equity and are recycled through the income statement at the time the hedged item affects the income statement.

Group and Company 2009 2008 Dividend yield 1.9% - 4.3% 1.9% - 4.1% Expected share price volatility 24.5% - 31.0% 24.5% - 31.0% Risk free interest rate 3.00% - 5.80% 4.29% - 5.80% Expected life of option years 3,5, 7 years 3,5, 7 years Exercise prices nil - 6.79 nil - 6.79 Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2009 77 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The initial fair value of executive options is adjusted to take into account the market-based performance condition.
Share capital The balance classified as share capital represents the nominal value of ordinary 10p shares issued.
Share premium The balance classified as share premium includes the net proceeds in excess of nominal value on issue of the Companys equity share capital, comprising 10p ordinary shares.
General reserve This reserve arose in 1993 when the High Court of Justice granted permission to reduce the Companys share premium account by 4,000,000 which was credited to a separate reserve named the general reserve.
Merger reserve Where shares have been issued as consideration for acquisitions, the value of shares issued in excess of nominal value has been credited to the merger reserve rather than to the share premium account.
Share based payments reserve This reserve records the fair value of share based payments expensed in the income statement.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge.
Translation reserve This reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
