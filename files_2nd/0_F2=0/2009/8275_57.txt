The Audit Committee has a process to ensure that any non-audit services do not compromise the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and that relevant UK and US professional and regulatory requirements are met.
A number of criteria are applied when deciding whether pre-approval for such services should be given.
These include the nature of the service, the level of fees and the practicality of appointing an alternative provider, having regard to the skills and experience required to supply the service effectively.
Cumulative fees for audit and non-audit services are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis for review.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring adherence to the pre-approval policy.
