They are initially recognised at fair value upon acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method allocates the interest income over the relevant period by applying the effective interest rate to the carrying amount of the asset.
The average effective interest rate, referred to in note 3, is 8.03% 2008 8.02%.
The income will be recognised over the life of the underlying PFI concessions based on this effective rate.
Loans and receivables balances include pound sterling denominated loans of 466.0 million 2008 484.9 million and 8.4 million 2008 - 9.4 million denominated in euros.
Cash and cash equivalents There has been a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from 31 December 2009 of 168 million primarily due to an increase in construction activity on Royal Childrens Hospital and Alberta Schools which are financed by structured bond financing arrangements.

This debt facility matures in May 2011 and is secured over all the assets of the Company.
