The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Smiths Group Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was introduced in 2004 and replaced the 95 ESOS for executive directors and senior executives.
Conditional awards of up to 1.5 times salary and exceptionally three times salary are granted annually.
The awards will be released following the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent the PSPs performance tests have been met.
One-third of the award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three year performance period.
25% of the award will vest if the companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straightline pro-rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
Full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% per annum.
25% vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
The PSP has been replaced by the VSP see below.
Value Sharing Plan VSP The VSP is a one-off long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders in July 2008 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
Corporate participants will be rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities will be rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
For the Group scheme, one-third of the award will depend on the growth in Smiths TSR over and above the median for the companies comprising the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies and the remaining two-thirds of each award will be determined by the growth in internal value in excess of 9.5% a year.
The growth in internal value is calculated as follows: adjusted profit before tax PBT times the ratio of PBT to market capitalisation determined at the date of grant plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders.
The divisional awards will depend on meeting an internal value growth target set for the division in which the participant works.
The participants in the VSP will not be eligible for awards under the Performance Share Plan in 2008 09 or 2009 10.
118 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Employee share schemes continued Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, as introduced in October 2005, the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed RoCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
In July 2008 the CIP was amended.
From 2009 participants will be required to invest 50% of their post tax bonus in purchased shares.
The performance conditions have been expanded to include an enhanced performance condition of RoCE exceeding WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum.
If the enhanced performance condition is met, two matching shares will be issued for every purchased share.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 832.08p 2008: 1,014.32p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2009 and 2008 are volatility of 23% 2008: 21% and dividend yield of 3.75% 2008: 3.75%.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, wherever available, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
Best estimates have been used where historical data is not available in this respect.
These generated a weighted average fair value for CIP of 6.96 2008: 9.46 and VSP PSP of 11.01 2008: 8.02.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 8.0m 2008: 12.9m, of which 9.4m 2008: 11.8m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.
At 31 July 2009 the creditor relating to cash-settled schemes is 0.2m 2008: 1.5m.
