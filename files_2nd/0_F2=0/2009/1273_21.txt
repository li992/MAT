Segmental reporting Management has determined the operating segments based on the information provided to the Board of directors which is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
The group is managed, and reports internally, on a basis consistent with its three operating divisions - UK Bus, Mainland Europe and UK Trains.
The principal activities of these divisions are set out in the chief executives review, which shows segmental revenue and operating profit grossed up to include the revenue and operating profit of associates, together with a reconciliation to the information below.

Exceptional item: From 1 December 2009, the benefit structure of the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan, the largest of the groups defined benefit schemes, was changed.
One of the principal changes is the capping of pensionable salary increases until the scheme returns to surplus on an uncapped basis.
In accordance with IAS19, this capping of future benefits has been recognised immediately in the groups income statement, giving rise to a curtailment gain of 46.8 million.
Tax on profit on ordinary activities includes a deferred tax charge of 13.1 million on the exceptional item.

The exceptional deferred tax charge in 2008 was due to the impact of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances in the UK.
As in previous years, adjustments in respect of prior years of 26.3 million 2008: 12.4 million reflect the resolution of a number of historical tax matters with the tax authorities, including 15 million relating to a settlement which is expected to give rise to total savings of approximately 68 million.
The Deferred tax - current year figure noted above is stated after recognising a further tax credit of 7 million in respect of this particular settlement, and the balance of 46 million is expected to be available for release to the income statement in future years.

The hindsight fair value adjustments in the year relate to the final determination of provisional fair value adjustments made in respect of prior year acquisitions.
Comparative amounts have not been restated following the final determination of fair value adjustments as the amounts included are not material.
128 | Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Accounts Accounts During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets.
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash generating unit, using cashflow projections based on the 2010 budget and business plans for 2011 to 2013, with cash flows for subsequent years extrapolated based on estimated growth rates of 2.0 per cent 2008: 2.0 per cent.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11.0 per cent 2008: 11.0 per cent has then been applied to the cashflows.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and profit margin.
The directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each cash generating unit and to be realistic in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
The review has resulted in an impairment charge of 29.6 million primarily in relation to goodwill in Portugal.
In light of the factors affecting the Portuguese bus market and the likely continued migration of revenue to the recently extended light-rail system south of Lisbon, the Portuguese operation has been fide-scaled to a level commensurate with the changed environment.
Goodwill is allocated across multiple cash generating units and the amount allocated to each unit is not significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and has confirmed that, apart from the impairment noted above, it is believed that any reasonably possible movement on assumptions will not lead to a material impairment and we have therefore not presented any sensitivity analysis.

Credit limits are in place for customers, many of which are local authorities or local transport authorities.
Due to the nature of certain contractual arrangements, particularly where the agreement and settlement of allocations of passenger revenues between multiple service providers can take more than one year to complete, certain customer debts can often exceed one year before settlement.
This is common, and the incidence of impairment of such debt is both rare and immaterial.

Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the groups non-current liabilities at 31 December was as follows: Finance 2009 Finance 2008 Debt leases Total Debt leases Total m m m m m m In more than one year but not more than two years 107.4 16.8 124.2 109.3 19.0 128.3 In more than two years but not more than five years 574.5 59.3 633.8 543.9 56.6 600.5 In more than five years 34.0 66.0 100.0 39.7 28.5 68.2 715.9 142.1 858.0 692.9 104.1 797.0 Borrowing facilities The group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2009 2008 m m Expiring within one year 53.0 78.0 Expiring in more than two years 290.2 180.3 343.2 258.3 Finance leases The group typically enters into finance leases of no more than five years duration on an amortising basis.
Given the short-term nature of this funding, the group considers there to be no material difference between the fair value of finance leases and their carrying amount in the balance sheet.
Finance lease obligations included in current liabilities amount to 23.4 million 2008: 29.1 million and in non-current liabilities amount to 142.1 million 2008: 104.1 million.

Financial risk management objectives and policies The group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market based risks principally relating to exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
These financial risks are managed by the group treasury function in accordance with a formal Board-approved treasury policy.
The policy sets a range of formal targets for managing the groups exposure to financial risks.
For further details of the groups financial risk management objectives and policies please refer to the financial review.
In addition, further information relating to credit risk and liquidity risk is detailed in notes 13 and 16 respectively.
Capital disclosures and compliance with financial covenants are detailed on page 47 of the financial review.
After taking into account the groups hedging policies referred to above, the sensitivity to changes in market based risks was as follows: a Foreign currency risk A 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the euro would decrease profit for the year in 2009 by 2.5 million and decrease equity by 10 million at 31 December 2009. b Interest rate risk A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce profit for the year in 2009 by 1.4 million and increase equity by 3 million at 31 December 2009. c Commodity risk A 10 per cent increase in fuel prices would reduce profit for the year in 2009 by 0.1 million and increase equity by 20 million at 31 December 2009.
In the sensitivity analyses above it is assumed that each change takes place at the beginning of the financial year and is held constant throughout the reporting period, all other variables remaining constant.

Retirement benefit obligations At 31 December 2009 the group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Wales Limited and XC Trains Limited, participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the RPS was carried out on 31 December 2007.
Total pension cost The total pension cost for the group was 11.7 million 2008: 47.6 million, net of the curtailment gain of 46.8 million detailed below.
The pension costs in respect of the groups defined contribution schemes was 42.4 million 2008: 32.4 million.
Defined benefit plans The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS under IAS19 as the group has no rights or obligations in respect of sections of this scheme following the expiry of the franchises.
This is accounted for by way of a franchise adjustment, which increased from nil at 31 December 2008 to 65.1 million at 31 December 2009.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited and XC Trains Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the IAS19 liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to 31 December 2009 by qualified independent actuaries KPMG LLP.
The schemes assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2009.
From 1 December 2009, the benefit structure of the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan, the largest of the groups defined benefit schemes, was changed.

The directors assessment of the expected returns is based on historical return trends, the forward looking views of financial markets suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
The actual gain on plan assets was 139.6 million 2008: 230.5 million loss.

Deferred tax The movement in deferred tax is shown below: 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 95.4 87.6 Exchange differences 4.9 11.7 Acquisition of subsidiaries 0.2 10.7 Income statement charge 0.7 26.6 Tax charged credited to equity 3.3 41.2 At 31 December 94.3 95.4 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets where there is uncertainty regarding the recoverability of the resulting deferred tax assets.
No benefit has been recognised in respect of 133 million of unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences due to uncertainties and restrictions regarding their utilisation.
Those unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences have the potential to produce tax credits of the order of 36 million in future years.
Deferred tax is not provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where the group has control over the timing of remittance and it is probable that remittance will not take place in the foreseeable future.
In addition, it is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption and therefore no tax liability is expected to arise.
Material deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
