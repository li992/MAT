Segmentinformation In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments Logica has derived the information for its operating segments using the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has identified the Executive Committee as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as it is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.
The profit measure used by the Executive Committee is the adjusted operating profit, as described in Note 8.
Operating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with the operating segments produced for internal management reporting.
The operating segments have not changed as a result of implementing IFRS 8.
However, during the current period Logica has consolidated the German business into the International segment, which has resulted in reclassification of 214.2 million of revenue, 2.9 million of operating profit and 11.9 million of adjusted operating profit Note 8 relating to financial year ended 31 December 2008 from Germany to the International segment.
Also, the Netherlands and Belgium businesses were consolidated into a newly created Benelux segment, which has resulted in a reclassification of 54.3 million of revenue, 0.2 million of operating loss and 0.2 million of adjusted operating profit Note 8 relating to financial year ended 31 December 2008 from the International segment to the Benelux segment.
Logica is organised into five operating segments based on the location of assets.

The restructuring comprised costs associated with the closure of offices predominantly in the UK and France, and redundancy of staff across the Group.
Exceptional costs relating to a business held for disposal amounted to 18.9 million, and relates to the Netherlands.
This includes 7.7 million of impairment of intangible assets Note 34.
This year, the Group completed the disposals of its two non-core businesses, Integrata AG and Cocq Datendienste GmbH in Germany.
Two other non-core divisions were also disposed of in the Nordic region.
Disposals generated a net loss of 3.5 million Note 35.

Adjusted earnings per share, both basic and diluted, have been shown as the Directors consider this to be helpful for a better understanding of the performance of the Groups underlying business.
The earnings measure used in adjusted earnings per share excludes, whenever such items occur: the results of discontinued operations: exceptional items: mark-to-market gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss: and amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in a business combination.
All items adjusted are net of tax where applicable.
The weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which are treated as cancelled.
The convertible bonds were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 as they were anti-dilutive: however, the convertible bonds were dilutive for the purposes of calculating diluted adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008.

Also, the Netherlands and Belgium businesses were consolidated into a newly created Benelux segment, which has resulted in a reclassification of 9.9 million of goodwill relating to financial year ended 31 December 2008 from the International to the Benelux segment.
A reportable segment may contain more than one cash-generating unit CGU.
 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to individual CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, where appropriate, divisions within a country.
The size of a CGU, therefore, varies but is never larger than a reportable segment.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
Although required to perform annual impairment tests, these do not have to take place at 31 December but the test should be consistently carried out at the same time annually.
The Group carries out its annual impairment testing as at 30 September each year.
Impairment testing is only reperformed if an impairment triggering event occurs in the intervening period.
No such event has occurred since 30 September 2009.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflect managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Keyassumptions The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In determining the key assumptions, management have taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Goodwill continued Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks specific to the CGU.
In determining the discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The discount rates applied to the CGUs were in the range of 8.0% 2008: 8.1% to 13.9% 2008: 15.2%.
The discount rates applied to the most significant CGUs were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Nordics 8.4 8.8 France 11.1 11.3 United Kingdom 10.2 10.9 Weighted average discount rate applied to CGUs in the Nordics and the United Kingdom.
Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is based on future market expectations and past performance.
The long-term operating margin refers to the margin on adjusted operating profit as described in Note 8.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
In such cases, these expected improvements exclude activities that would be defined as restructuring and are independent of technological change or evolution of best practices that the Group could not predict or influence.
The long-term operating margins applied to CGUs were in the range of 5.0% 2008: 6.0% to 10.0% 2008: 10.0%.
The long-term operating margins assumed for the most significant CGUs were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Nordics 9.0 10.0 France 9.0 10.0 United Kingdom 9.0 10.0 Weighted average long-term operating margin applied to CGUs in the Nordics and the United Kingdom.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken, and were in the range of 1.9% 2008: 1.9% to 6.0% 2008: 5.1%.
The long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows assumed for the most significant CGUs were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Nordics 2.4 2.5 France 2.0 3.0 United Kingdom 2.4 2.4 Summaryofresults During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2008: nil.
As part of the VIU testing the Directors consider the impact that a range of scenarios would have on the key assumptions within the VIU calculation.
The VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating margin.
The Directors are of the opinion that it would take a systemic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
The Directors consider that a reduction of 1% in the absolute value of long-term operating margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is flexible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of sectors and geographies and has a large number of long-term contracts which help to insulate it from more significant changes.
If the long-term operating margins used in the value in use calculations for all cash-generating units were 1% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have to recognise any goodwill impairment charge.
If operating margins remain in perpetuity at current year levels the Group would recognise an impairment in two of its smaller CGUs being its Czech Republic CGU of 4.8 million and its Brazil CGU of 5.3 million.
The Directors do not believe it is reasonably possible for this to occur based on their view of current prospects.
The Group bases its estimate for the long-term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The Directors have assessed that a 1% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible because this represents a 10% to 20% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash flows of all cash-generating units were 1% higher in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised any goodwill impairment charge.
96 Logica Annual report and accounts 2009 16.
Goodwill continued The Group uses a long-term growth rate that is the same as the long-term growth rate of gross domestic product GDP of the country in which the CGU is based.
Given these are long-term rates the Directors consider a change of 1% in the absolute value of the long-term growth rate to be the limit of what is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth rates used in the VIU calculations for all cash-generating units were 1% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised any goodwill impairment charge.
The Directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across all CGUs combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.

 continued The Groups credit risk on trade and other receivables is primarily attributable to trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.
The majority of trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts represent amounts due from government bodies and large corporate internationals, spread across the following geographies: 2009 2008 Amounts Amounts Trade recoverable Trade recoverable receivables on contracts receivables on contracts m m m m Nordics 163.8 25.1 195.3 26.9 France 197.5 80.9 288.4 80.6 United Kingdom 58.5 172.9 74.0 141.7 Benelux 92.0 29.6 141.1 35.4 International 106.4 27.1 116.0 31.1 618.2 335.6 814.8 315.7 The Directors estimate that the carrying value of financial assets within trade and other receivables approximated their fair value.
At 31 December 2009, trade receivables of 91.2 million 2008: 217.7 million were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are still considered recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 80 days 2008: 64 days.
Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 8.0 6.1 Provision for receivables impairment 3.0 4.5 Disposals of subsidiaries businesses 0.1 0.1 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible 3.3 2.4 Unused amounts reversed 0.3 1.7 Foreign exchange 0.5 1.6 At 31 December 6.8 8.0 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual debtors.
The Directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in net operating costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
Unwind of discount is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income Note 11.
Amounts charged to the provision account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
At 31 December 2009, trade receivables of 7.1 million 2008: 8.5 million were either partially or fully impaired.
The ageing of these receivables was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Less than three months 0.1 0.6 Three to six months 0.2 1.3 Over six months 6.8 6.6 7.1 8.5 The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above.

Included in cash at bank and in hand were overdrafts that were part of cash pooling arrangements for which a legal right of off-set existed against positive cash balances that were of an equal or greater amount at the end of the reporting period.
The Directors estimate that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated their fair value.
The Groups policy for cash investments requires that cash and deposits only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum A1 P1 short-term rating and Aequivalent long-term credit rating.
The reference to ratings must include at least one from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Cash and deposits are limited to 25.0 million per bank where the bank has a minimum AArating and 10 million per bank where the bank is rated A or A-.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by any of these counterparties.

The facility was increased by 12.5 million on 30 June 2009.
At 31 December 2009, 205 million 181.4 million was drawn down under the facility 2008: 194.2 million and paid interest at an average rate of 4.65% 2008: 6.74%.

At 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, the term loan was drawn down in full and paid interest at an average rate of 2.70% 2008: 5.60%.
a 100 million receivables facility was signed on 22 July 2009.
The facility matures on 22 July 2011 and was undrawn at 31 December 2009. a 50 million forward starting bilateral term loan was signed on 31 July 2009.
The term loan will be available from 19 September 2010 for 30 months maturing 19 March 2013. a 25 million bilateral revolving credit facility was signed on 21 December 2009.
The facility matures on 21 December 2013.
The facility was undrawn at 31 December 2009.
The obligations of the borrowers under the 512.5 million facility and the 219.2 million bank loan are guaranteed by the principal UK and Dutch trading subsidiaries, Logica UK Limited and Logica Nederland B.

Allborrowings Bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and other borrowings bear floating rates of interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred, and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The finance lease obligations bear fixed rates of interest and therefore expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All borrowings are denominated in the borrowing entitys functional currency except for certain amounts drawn down under the revolving credit facility and term loans.
Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing company are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations see Note 26 and therefore only expose the Group to statement of comprehensive income foreign currency risk to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.

The principal risks that the Group is exposed to are capital risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies with respect to managing those risks in both the current and prior year are set out below.
The Group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding and foreign exchange management.
The Groups treasury function operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the Board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the Groups risks.
The policies provide written principles on net debt management, currency mix of debt, central funding liquidity, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, bonds and guarantees, and cash investment and counterparty limits.
Compliance with key policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
Capital risk management The Groups policy on capital structure is to keep the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation below a target level reviewed by the Board.
The target is comfortably below the covenants contained within the Groups banking facilities.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations in many countries worldwide, exposing the Group to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position of foreign operations into pounds sterling.
Operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and, once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The translation of the statement of financial positions of overseas operations has been partially hedged by managing the currency mix of the Groups borrowings.
The Group used euro and Swedish krona borrowings to hedge the statement of financial position translation of operations with the euro and Swedish krona as their functional currency.
The Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the statement of comprehensive incomes of overseas operations.
To mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than an entitys functional currency, assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currencies are hedged economically by means of forward contracts.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting to these contracts.
The Group treasurys risk management policy requires all companies in the Group to hedge their material assets and liability exposures in full by using forward contracts.
Additionally, where material, the Group hedges its contracted future project cash flows in foreign currencies by using forward contracts.
Group treasury is the only entity in the Group allowed to transact external foreign exchange contracts with banks.
To ensure compliance with the above policy, subsidiaries will use Group treasury as an internal bank, hedging their material foreign exchange exposures on an inter-company basis.
These exposures are then aggregated and netted in Group treasury and the overall position hedged externally.
The foreign exchange exposures for the most significant foreign currencies reported to Group treasury and the related hedging of those exposures against UK pounds sterling at 31 December were as follows: 2009 m US$m SEKm Reported exposure 229.4 34.6 2,506.5 Forward contracts 229.4 34.6 2,506.5 2008 m US$m SEKm Reported exposure 207.5 49.9 137.1 Forward contracts 207.5 49.9 137.1 104 Logica Annual report and accounts 2009 26.
Financialinstruments continued Positive amounts represented an asset or a forward purchase, whereas negative amounts represented a liability or forward sale.
At 31 December 2009, if the euro, US dollar and Swedish krona had strengthened by 10% against pounds sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit and equity for the year would have been lower higher as follows: 2009 2008 Profit Profit and loss Equity and loss Equity  m m m m Euro 2.3 25.6 1.4 33.0 US dollar 0.2 0.1 Swedish krona 19.9 0.4 31.8 If these currencies had weakened by 10%, the opposite would be true.
The movement in post-tax profit is as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US dollar, euro and Swedish krona denominated derivatives used to hedge contracted project future cash flows.
The movement on equity is mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains on translation of borrowings and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The above impact on equity of movements in exchange rates does not include the change in value of underlying investments denominated in foreign currency which are being hedged.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and debt.
Careful consideration is given to the appropriate split of debt and equity to ensure acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is then further managed by hedging a portion of the Groups floating rate borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had 96.9 million 2008: 80.0 million of fixed rate borrowings out of total borrowings of 429.9 million 2008: 565.0 million.
If interest rates on floating rate euro, Swedish krona and pounds sterling denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher during the year ended 31 December 2009 and 2008, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been lower as a result of higher interest expense on those borrowings, as follows: 2009 2008 Borrowings m m Euro 2.3 1.7 Swedish krona 0.4 Pounds sterling 0.2 0.1 Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain sufficient headroom to meet its foreseeable financing requirements.
Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had available committed bank facilities of 789.6 million 2008: 848.3 million of which 395.3 million 2008: 532.0 million had been drawn down, giving a headroom of 394.3 million 2008: 316.3 million.
The highest amount drawn down on these facilities during 2009 was 477.7 million 2008: 759.1 million.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the statement of financial position to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and include both interest and principal cash flows.
The adjustment column represents the possible future cash flows attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which are not included in the carrying amount of the financial liability in the statement of financial position.
Except for bank loans and finance lease obligations, balances due within year equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

It requires disclosure of fair value measurement by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Input other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as price or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
Inputs from the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group had only Level 2 financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
The following table shows the value and type of derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2009.
These are recognised as separate assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables at 31 December 2009: 2009 2008 m m Assets: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading 0.5 34.8 Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging 6.9 Totalassets 7.4 34.8 Liabilities: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading 7.2 3.2 Forward interest rate agreements held for trading 0.5 Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging 28.0 Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges 0.2 Totalliabilities 7.4 31.7 Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined from dealer quotes of the instruments.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.
The principal currencies of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2009 were the euro, Swedish krona and the US dollar.
The notional amounts outstanding at that date were 229.3 million net buying 2008: 190.8 million net buying, SEK 2,532.8 million net selling 2008: SEK 2,709.2 million net selling and $32.9 million selling 2008: $47.5 million selling.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations On 1 January 2009, the Group had euro and Swedish krona borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in eurozone countries and Sweden.
The designated borrowings comprised the SEK 2,300 million forward contracts, 110 million drawn down under the Groups 219.2 million term loan facility and 179 million of forward contracts.
The fair value of the designated euro borrowings forward contracts at 31 December 2009 was a liability of 95.3 million 2008: 200.9 million and that of the Swedish krona forward contracts was an asset of 5.0 million 2008: liability of 19.7 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 40.8 million relating to these borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 111.0 million loss has been recognised directly in the translation reserve.
There was no hedging ineffectiveness recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: nil.
The foreign exchange gain was offset by the decline in value in pounds sterling terms, of the Groups net assets in eurozone countries and Sweden.

The property costs provided for are mainly related to properties located in the United Kingdom.
At 31 December 2009, non-current vacant property provisions amounted to 30.8 million 2008: 31.7 million of which 22.9 million 2008: 29.5 million was payable within five years and the balance thereafter.
Restructuring At 31 December 2009, the restructuring provision mainly related to the restructuring of the businesses following the outcome of the Groups business review announced 22 April 2008.
The restructuring programme comprised property rationalisation, a reduction in headcount and other measures to reduce the cost base.
Where appropriate, provisions arising from the property rationalisation are categorised as vacant property.
At 31 December 2009, 42.9 million of the restructuring provision was payable within one year, with the remaining balance payable between two and five years.
Other At 31 December 2009, the other provisions related to the value of legal claims and business disposal provisions.
At 31 December 2009, 9.4 million of the other provision was payable within one year, with the remaining balance payable between two and five years.

Deferredtax continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
An analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes is shown in the table below: 2009 2008 m m Deferred tax assets 74.8 59.1 Deferred tax liabilities 75.3 119.3 0.5 60.2 At 31 December 2009, the Group had unused tax losses of 244.3 million 2008: 318.8 million available for offset against future taxable profits for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised.
At 31 December 2009, 77.1 million 2008: 112.9 million of the unused losses are subject to time expiry rules and will expire in full on or before 31 December 2019 2008: 31 December 2022.
No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group has estimated that tax of 7.9 million 2008: 43.5 million would arise in respect of remitting all earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the United Kingdom to the extent legally possible.
Subject to the Companys Articles of Association and applicable law, the Companys ordinary shares confer on the holder: the right to receive notice of and vote at general meetings of the Company: the right to receive any surplus assets on a winding-up of the Company: and an entitlement to receive any dividend declared on ordinary shares.

Otherreserves continued Treasuryshares The Group holds shares in the Logica ESOP Trust for the benefit of Logica employees.
The Trust purchases the Companys shares in the market for use in connection with the Groups employee share plans.
As at the year end, the Treasury Shares reserve related solely to shares purchased and disposed of by the Trust, and would be deducted in determining the amount the Company had available for distribution at that date.
At 31 December 2009, the Trust owned 12,930,222 ordinary shares 2008: 13,659,965 with a nominal value of 1.3 million 2008: 1.4 million.
The trustees of the Logica ESOP Trust have agreed to waive the right to future dividends on ordinary shares held by the Trust except for a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2009 and 2008, the nominal amount payable to the Trust was 0.001 pence per share.
Translation reserve The translation reserve represented the accumulated exchange differences arising from the following sources: the impact of the translation of the statement of comprehensive income and net assets of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than pounds sterling: exchange differences recycled on disposal of foreign operations: exchange differences arising on the translation of net investments in a foreign operation where any subsidiary of the Group may have a receivable from or a payable to a foreign operation and settlement is neither planned nor likely: and exchange differences arising on hedging instruments that are designated hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, net of tax where applicable.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve is a non-distributable reserve and contained the nominal value of the shares re-purchased and cancelled.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represented the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the Company to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 131 of the Act.
When applicable, the section required that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, the Company did not record a premium on the share it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position.
During 2008 the Group issued 135 million shares which led to an increase in the merger reserve of 75.9 million.
This was net of expense of 1.0 million.
During the year 2009, merger reserve of 75.9 million was realised on redemption of preference shares by Logica Jersey 2008 Limited, a group company, and hence transferred to retained earnings.

 The assets classified as held for sale relate to intangible assets held by the Groups payroll processing division in the Netherlands.
Following a decision by the Board of Directors, the Group has decided to sell the business.
The sale of the business is expected to be completed during the first half of 2010.
Disposals The Group completed the sale of certain non-core businesses during the year.
The aggregate net assets of these businesses, which are not individually significant, at their date of disposal are analysed below: m Intangible assets 4.9 Property, plant and equipment 0.6 Trade and other receivables 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents 3.2 Trade and other payables 3.4 Retirement benefit obligations 0.3 Other non-current liabilities 1.7 Net assets disposed of 7.5 Total consideration 5.7 Disposal costs 1.7 Loss on disposal 3.5 Cash consideration received 5.7 Cash and cash equivalents disposed of 3.2  2.5 The disposals do not match the criteria of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations as none of the disposals represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and hence were not treated as a discontinued operation.

Acquisitions During February and March 2009 the Group made payments to acquire the non-controlling interest in Logica Aktiebolag, a Group company, and redeem the remaining shares in and convertibles issued by the Swedish subsidiary, which was part of the WM-data Group acquisition in 2006.
A total of 48.6 million was paid.
This included 0.8 million to redeem convertible debentures.
The non-controlling interest was held at 12.0 million at the date of acquisition.
Under IFRS 3 R which the Group has early adopted from 1 January 2009, the 36.2 million excluding a foreign exchange gain of 0.4 million included in translation reserves is recorded as a movement in equity.
Share-basedpayment  The Group operates the following equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Restricted Stock Award RSA, the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Logica Partners Incentive Plan PIP, the Logica Performance Multiplier Plan PMP, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave Plans International and UK approved, the Executive Equity Participation Plan 2006 ExEPP 2006, the Employee Equity Partnership Plan EmEPP and the Executive Share Option Plan 2006 ESOP 2006 and two further plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Executive Equity Partnership Plan ExEPP.
Under the latter two plans, no further grants will be made as their ten-year award cycle has come to an end, but under which executives still have current awards.
A summary of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment expense has been recognised.
Restricted Stock Award On commencement of employment, in compensation for forfeited incentives, Andy Green received a restricted share award of 2,110,967 ordinary shares to vest over a period of four consecutive years from commencement of employment.
The number of shares that vest at each tranche will be increased by reference to dividends paid on shares between the grant date and the vesting date.
The shares are released in tranches at the end of March in each of the four years and vest immediately provided he is still employed by the Group on the vesting date.
The first tranche was granted in February 2008 and vested in March 2008.
Restricted Share Plan The Board has approved the adoption of a Restricted Share Plan to be used to reward executives below Board level, for new hires and for retention purposes.
Historically Logica has made one-off awards for recruitment and or retention on a bespoke basis without having an underlying framework set of rules to support them.
The RSP will be used in connection with the recruitment of senior employees where it is sometimes necessary to compensate for the value of share-based awards forfeited on cessation of employment with previous employers and or to offer a joining grant or to support the retention of critical employees with awards being satisfied by market purchase shares.
No awards have been made during 2009.
Partners Incentive Plan The PIP is a discretionary benefit offered by the Group for the benefit of its senior employees.
This plan is ultimately expected to replace the LTIP.
The value of the award is based on an annual pool determined by the reference to profit performance.
Selected employees Partners are awarded point allocations in connection with a pool year, these points are then converted into conditional awards of deferred free shares following the determination of the annual pool.
The annual pool is determined by the level of profit before tax achieved.
The conditional awards will vest three years from grant subject to continued employment but are not subject to performance conditions.
Although this plan was not formally approved until February 2009 it was communicated to those likely to participate in the scheme in September 2008 and the first pool year was communicated as the year ended 31 December 2008.
As a result there is a share-based payment expense in respect of this plan in 2008 despite the fact that no awards were granted until 2009.
For all subsequent years there will be a full years share-based payment expense for the year prior to grant with the awards vesting 4.25 years from commencement of the service condition and pool year, or three years from the actual grant.
Performance Multiplier Plan The PMP is also a discretionary benefit offered by the Group to its most senior employees.
The PMP has the potential to reward the most senior employees with an additional award of up to twice the number of deferred shares awarded under the PIP.
PMP awards will ordinarily vest at the same time as the deferred share awards granted under the PIP i. e. three years from grant 4.25 years from commencement of service condition and the pool year subject to continued employment and to the extent that the performance conditions attached to the awards have been achieved.
The PMP is conditional on a measure of EPS performance.
Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a discretionary benefit offered by the Group for the benefit of its senior employees, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise significant achievements.
An award under the LTIP may be granted as a conditional allocation, a nil or nominal cost option with a short exercise window or as forfeitable shares.
Cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards may also be granted or cash-based payments may be used to satisfy an award originally made in shares either in whole or part, although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to do so.
The maximum market value of ordinary shares in the Company subject to LTIP awards granted to any employee in any financial year will not exceed 200% of that employees base salary.
The intention initially is not to exceed 150% of salary.
Share-basedpayment continued The performance condition attached to one half of an award will require annual earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum over three financial years for between 30% and 100% of this half of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other half of an award will measure the Total Shareholder Return performance TSR of Logica over a single three-year performance period against a number of other companies.
30% of this half of the award will vest if the Company is ranked in the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of this half of the award vesting if Logica is at or above the upper quartile.
The Remuneration Committee intends to review the performance conditions each year to ensure that they remain suitable and reflect the ongoing market.
Sharesave Plans The Group operates UK and International savings-related share option plans under which employees enter into a savings contract with a financial institution to pay a fixed monthly sum for a three-year period.
The price at which share options are granted is the mid-market price of a Logica share on the business day prior to the invitation to apply to join the plan to which a discount of 20% has been applied.
The aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract.
Share options may be exercised six months following the vesting date.
There are no performance conditions attached to Sharesave Plans.
On 3 April 2008 573,218 SAyE contracts granted in 2006 and 2007 were cancelled and replaced with an equivalent number of options with a grant date of 3 April 2008.
Under IFRS 2, the incremental increase in fair values as a result of a modification, is expensed from the point of modification to vesting date.
The modification of the grants for 2006 and 2007 has led to an incremental increase in fair values of 0.2 million measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Equity Participation Partnership Plans The Group operates an equity participation plan for senior executives, the ExEPP 2006, and in certain countries an equity partnership plan open to all employees the EmEPP.
The terms of both plans are similar.
Under the equity participation partnership plans, employees make an investment in the Companys shares, subject to financial limits, which must be maintained over a three-year vesting period.
Shares will vest under the Executive Equity Partnership and Participation Employee Equity Partnership plans for all grants prior to 2008 if a performance condition is met and the participant is still employed at the vesting date.
Under the ExEPP 2006, senior executives, in any one year, may invest in shares up to a maximum of 50% of net bonus paid.
These lodged shares will be matched on a 1:1 gross basis the Matching Award.
Matching Award shares will be released as soon as practicable after the third anniversary of the award, subject to the stretching performance conditions having been met.
The performance conditions in respect of the ExEPP 2006 have the same criteria as the Companys LTIP performance conditions described above.
Awards made since 2008 under the Employee Equity Partnership Plan do not carry a performance condition.
Awards of a matching number of shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse.
Although no further awards will be made under the ExEPP there remain outstanding awards which have yet to be exercised.
This plan was operated for senior executives as an equity-based investment plan subject to financial limits and the investment being maintained over a three-year vesting period.
Vesting will occur for those executives employed at the vesting date subject to a performance condition based on growth in the Groups earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum.
The exercise period for the ExEPP runs for seven years from the maturity date.
Executive Share Option Plan 2006 At the Companys AGM in 2006 shareholders approved the implementation of the ESOP 2006.
This plan has been introduced to allow awards to be made to senior executives working in jurisdictions where it would be inappropriate to make an award under the LTIP.
It is anticipated that performance conditions attached to any ESOP 2006 awards will have the same criteria as the LTIP noted above.
As yet, no awards have been made under this plan.
Executive Share Option Scheme No new option grants will be made under the ESOS, although options made under previous grants to senior executives and managers across the Group remain outstanding.
Options are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following grant, provided that a performance condition, specified at the date of grant, has been satisfied.
Typically, growth in the Groups earnings per share over the relevant three-year performance period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21% for the performance condition to be met.
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven-year exercise period, while the exercise period for option grants in 2005 and 2006 is four years.
Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for ESOS options granted in 2003 but only once for options granted in 2004.
No retesting is permitted for grants awarded in 2005 and 2006.
The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant, although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.
US Stock Purchase Plan US-based employees are eligible to participate in a tax-favourable share purchase plan.
They may save up to a maximum of $2,000 per annum, the savings being used to buy shares at quarterly intervals.
Logica North America contributes an additional 15% to the amount saved per employee.
US-based employees are not eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plans or the EmEPP.
112 Logica Annual report and accounts 2009 37.
Share-basedpayment continued Insight formerly Unilog plan Managers in France who are eligible to participate in the Insight fund could annually choose to invest all or part of their bonus into this fund.
Logica France contributes 50% of the bonus invested by the employee to a maximum of 4,000 per annum.
The Insight fund currently invests 100% of its capital in Logica shares and is managed by an external fund manager appointed by Logica France.
French Savings Plan A Plan dEpargne dEnterprise P. E. E. is operated for those employees in France not covered by the Insight plan above.
There is a maximum individual investment amount per year, to which Logica adds an amount equivalent to the amount of employers national insurance saved.
The funds are invested for a period of five years and are exempt from tax.
The funds are managed by CIC Bank and are invested in shares.
These awards have service conditions relating to 2008 and 2009 but the grants do not take place until the year following the commencement of the service condition.
As a result there is a share-based payment charge during the year of service and prior to grant.
In the above analysis these provisional awards are reflected in the year of service and are reversed in the year they are replaced by the actual grant.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2009 was 86p 2008: 110.9p.

At 31 December 2008 a share-based payment charge was included for four months.
For 2009 a share-based payment charge has been included for service from 1 January 2009.
As the grants do not occur until after the end of the reporting period these awards are included as provisional awards.

The fair values of share awards under the Equity Participation Partnership Plans were measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which award holders have no entitlement.
The fair values of the provisional share awards under the PIP and PMP for 2008 were measured as the market share price at the 31 December 2008 as the actual grant did not occur until 2009.
For 2009 the fair value has been estimated using the market share price at 31 December 2009 but also applying the same ratio of fair value to market price as used for the grants during 2009.
Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option.
The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
Share awards under the Equity Participation Partnership Plans are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date.
Sharesave options are assumed to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full.
Adjustments are made subsequently to the number of shares expected to vest, to reflect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the final determination on the vesting date.
The share-based payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the end of the reporting period to the end of the vesting period following cessation of employment.
A weighted average forfeiture rate of 9% per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 9%.
For exercises prior to the vesting date, the additional expense between the calculation date and the vesting date is immediately charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group and the Company recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of 7.8 million and 1.4 million 2008: 10.3 million and 2.3 million respectively.
Share-basedpayment continued  The Group or the Company does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payments arrangements: however, social security obligations arising on share option and share award plans are treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes.
For the Group, the liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments at 31 December 2009 was 3.1 million 2008: 1.4 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in an expense for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 1.7 million 2008: 0.2 million.
For the Company, the liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments at 31 December 2009 was 0.7 million 2008: 0.3 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in a charge for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 0.4 million 2008: 0.2 million.
  The Group operates a number of voluntary pension schemes of the defined contribution type in the UK and overseas, under which contributions are paid by Group undertakings.
In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for defined contribution schemes amounted to 126.1 million 2008: 112.7 million.
In Sweden, the Group contributed to the Alecta SE pension scheme which is a defined benefit pension scheme.
This pension scheme was classified as a defined contribution scheme as it is a multi-employer plan and sufficient information is not available to bifurcate the assets of the plan between the various employers.
Any surplus or deficit in the plan will affect the amount of future contributions payable.
Alecta used a collective funding ratio to determine the surplus or deficit in the pension scheme.
The collective funding is the difference between Alectas assets and the commitments to the policyholders and insured individuals.
The collective solvency is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 155%, with the target being 140%.
At the 31 December 2009, Alectas collective funding ratio was 141% 2008: 112%.
As the solvency ratio at 31 December 2008 was outside the permitted range contributions levels have been restored to normal levels resulting in a cost of SEK 168.6 million for 2009 2008: SEK 140.2 million.
In the past reduced contributions were paid as a result of the high level of solvency.
 In addition, the Group operates defined benefit pension schemes primarily for the benefit of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller schemes in other European countries and the US.
Defined benefit schemes are usually funded by contributions from the employing companies, and in some cases also employees, to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the Group.
Scheme benefits typically provide for a pension in retirement based on years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
The main schemes in the UK and the Netherlands are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations, for funding purposes, for the main schemes are set out below: CMG Netherlands Scheme last full actuarial valuation at 1 January 2007 The Scheme has been closed to new entrants since 1 July 1994.
The Scheme had a surplus of 11.8 million as at 1 January 2007.
Logica Defined Benefit Pension Plan last full actuarial valuation at 30 June 2008 Based on the assumptions adopted in the Statement of Funding Principles the Plan had a deficit of 1.25 million.
The Group made a one-off deficit repair contribution of 1.6 million in September 2009.
LogicaCMG UK Pension and Life Assurance Scheme last full actuarial valuation at 31 December 2006 At the time of the valuation the Scheme had a small deficit which was cleared by a one-off contribution of 0.1 million.
CMG UK Pension Scheme last full actuarial valuation at 31 December 2007 The Scheme has been closed to new entrants since 2001.
Based on the assumptions adopted in the Statement of Funding Principles the Scheme had a deficit of 23.0 million.
The Group has agreed a plan with the Trustees to clear the deficit by 30 June 2012.
Under the recovery plan, starting from1 January 2009, Logica will pay an additional contribution of 5% of pensionable salaries and make a series of 13 additional quarterly payments averaging 1.75 million.
To meet the requirements of IAS 19, valuations for plan assets, reimbursement rights and defined benefit obligations were carried out at 31 December 2009 by qualified actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.

 continued The expected rates of return on government bonds and corporate bonds is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period for bonds of a similar term to those held as plan assets.
The expected rate of return on equities is determined by reference to real historical equity market returns.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is calculated as a weighted average of the expected rates of return of individual asset classes.
The weighted average is calculated by reference to the amount in each class of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.
Plan assets in overseas schemes include ordinary shares of the Company with a fair value of 1.4 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 0.9 million but do not include any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.

 The size, structure and geographic spread of the Group and its activities naturally exposes it to potential scrutiny and possible legal claims including tax and other regulatory authorities in the normal course of operations.
The results of tax audits and other similar enquiries are normally reflected in the accounts on an accruals basis where a recovery or liability can be predicted with reasonable certainty.
Occasionally claims may be levied against the Group by such authorities, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.
While Logica strongly believes it complies with all relevant laws and regulations, and would vigorously defend itself against any such claims, if it was unsuccessful the enforcement of such claims could from time to time have a potentially material impact on the Groups results and financial position.
As part of those enquiries, the Group has, in 2009, received a 46 million, which is net of 13 million tax, VAT claim from the French tax authorities.
The claim relates to the VAT treatment of goods exported from France during the years 2004-2006.
The Group has carefully analysed these claims and obtained external experts advice, as a result of which it considers that they are without merit.
The Group is robustly contesting these claims through the appropriate channels albeit this is expected to be a protracted process.

Accountingpolicies The following are the principal accounting policies of the Company which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
The Company has taken advantage of an exemption available in FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements and has not prepared a cash flow statement.
 Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost.
Such investments include both investments in shares issued by the subsidiary and other parent entity interests that in substance form part of the parent entitys investment in the subsidiary.
These include investments in the form of loans which have no fixed repayment terms and which have been provided to subsidiaries as an additional source of long-term capital.
Trade amounts receivable from subsidiaries in the normal course of business and other amounts advanced on commercial terms and conditions are included in debtors.
Investments in subsidiaries in the Companys balance sheet are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Investments in subsidiaries held for sale are accounted for at fair value in accordance with FRS 26.
Any difference arising on revaluation of investments is recognised directly in other reserves.
Financial instruments The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions available in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 25 para 3 c b and FRS 29 para 2 d not to disclose any information relating to financial instruments as the Companys financial statements are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements.
The following policies for financial instruments have been applied in the preparation of the Companys financial statements: Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand include deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand if there is legal right to offset against positive cash balances.
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can be withdrawn at any time without notice and without penalty or if a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours or one working day has been agreed.
Cash includes cash in hand and deposits denominated in foreign currencies.
Debtors Debtors are stated at amounts receivable less any provision for recoverability.
A trade or other receivable is derecognised from the balance sheet when the Company enters into a financing transaction which transfers to a third party all significant rights or other access to benefits relating to that asset, and all significant exposures to the risks inherent in that asset.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated either at amortised cost or, if designated as such, at fair value through profit or loss.
For borrowings stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable profits at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling.
