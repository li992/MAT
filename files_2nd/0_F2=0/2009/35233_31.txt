Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2009 76 Notes to the financial statements 4 Segmental information The group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1st January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which in the groups case is its executive board comprising the six executive directors in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The internal financial reports received by the groups executive board contain financial information at a group level as a whole and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.
These internal financial reports include the IFRS figures but also report the non-IFRS figures for recurring earnings per share, adjusted net asset value and recurring profit.
Reconciliations of each of these figures to their statutory equivalents are detailed in notes 16, 34 and 35, respectively.
Additionally, information is provided to the executive board showing gross property income and investment property valuation by individual property.
Therefore, for the purposes of IFRS 8, each individual property is considered to be a separate operating segment in that its performance is monitored individually.
The groups investment property portfolio comprises 91% offices by value.
The directors consider that these properties have similar types of tenants, they demonstrate similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics.
Therefore, these individual properties have been aggregated into a single operating segment.
The remaining 9% represents a mixture of retail, hotel, residential and light industrial properties, as well as land, each of which is fide minimis in its own right.
Accordingly, the directors are of the view that it is appropriate to disclose two reportable segments, offices and other, by reference to gross property income and investment property value.
Note: some offices have an ancillary element such as retail or residential.
The group also owns a joint venture in Prague which represents 0.2% of the groups assets see note 42.
No geographical grouping is contained in any of the internal financial reports provided to the groups executive board.
Therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is required by IFRS 8.
However, the following analysis is included to provide users with additional information regarding the geographical areas contained in the business review.

The balance of 123.7m 2008: 118.8m is derived solely from rental income from the groups properties.
Of these amounts, 4.2m 2008: 4.2m was derived from a lease to BT of the Angel Building, EC1, where in March 2007, the group entered into an arrangement with BT to restructure the lease arrangements such that the group could obtain possession of the building whilst maintaining rental income from BT until March 2010 albeit that, if the group disposed of this property, the right to that rental income would pass to the purchaser.
The group has included the income from this building within gross property income as, although similar to a lease surrender arrangement, the groups entitlement to this rental income is linked to its continued ownership of the property rather than being an unconditional amount receivable whether as an upfront payment or through a series of instalments.
In 2008, development income of 0.5m was received which was the proportion of the total profit share earned by the group from the project management of the construction and letting of a property on behalf of a third party.
No development income was received during 2009.
Other income of 1.5 m 2008: 0.9m relates to fees and commissions earned in relation to the management of the groups properties and is recognised in the group income statement in accordance with the delivery of services.

Group and company equity-settled option scheme The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of options granted during the year under the equity-settled option scheme operated by the group.
No options were granted during 2008.
This is a new scheme separate to the performance share plan and other option schemes as disclosed in the directors remuneration report on pages 55 to 62.
The directors are not entitled to any awards under this scheme.
2009 2008 Option pricing model used Binomial lattice Share price at date of grant 6.10 Exercise price 6.10 Number granted 69,500 Number lapsed in the year 5,000 Contractual life 10 years Risk free interest rate 2.7% Volatility 37% Dividend yield 4.0% For the 2009 grant, additional assumptions have been made that there is no employee turnover and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 20% in the money and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 100% in the money.
The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on a statistical analysis of daily prices over the last three years.
There were 64,500 options exercisable at 31st December 2009 2008: nil.
Group cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc.
A binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31st December 2009 of 13.20 2008: 7.25 and a dividend yield of 1.9% 2008: 3% were used together with risk-free interest rates of between 0.5% and 2.3% 2008: between 1.7% and 2.6% depending on the term of the options.
Due to the small number of individuals who have been granted these options, an assumption of zero employee turnover has been made.
Additionally, volatilities of 58% pa, 49% pa and 40% pa 2008: 48% pa, 38% pa and 31% pa have been used for options with lives of one year, three years and five years and over, respectively.
In general, the value of an option is affected by how quickly employees are assumed to exercise their awards after vesting.
In this case, however, given the other assumptions, the share price at the 31st December 2009, and the fact that the expected lives of the options are relatively short, the fair values are not sensitive to this assumption.
It has been assumed that employees try to maximise their returns and therefore do not exercise their options immediately, but tend to exercise their options later at the financially optimal date.
14 Pension costs The group and company operate a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter was acquired as part of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc and is closed to new members.
All new employees will join the defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the group companies.
Defined contribution plan The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was 0.9m 2008: 0.7m.
Defined benefit plan The defined benefit scheme, which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with Ignis Asset Management and F&C Investments plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.

A review for impairment of the investment in subsidiaries was carried out in accordance with IAS 36 on both value in use and fair value less costs to sell bases.
The companys accounting policy is to carry investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and net asset value and recognise any impairment in the income statement.
In the opinion of the directors, the most appropriate estimate of the recoverable amount is the net asset value of the subsidiaries.
In view of the fall in the value of the investment properties, there has been a related reduction in the net asset value of the subsidiaries which has been reflected as an impairment in the company income statement of 49.0m 2008: 336.3m.
Of this amount, 45.0m relates to the investment in London Merchant Securities Ltd.
This amount is transferred from retained earnings to the merger reserve within other reserves.
The remaining 4.0m relates to two of the companys other investments and remains within retained earnings.
The company liquidated its investment in Bramley Road Ltd during the year.
The investment was being carried at 6.2m and made a loss on liquidation of 3.5m.
During the year, the company became the direct beneficial owner of the shares in LMS Kingston Ltd, an indirect subsidiary company, for nil consideration.
These shares were sold to a third party realising net proceeds of 1.0m and a profit on disposal of 0.6m.
The company increased its investment in two of its subsidiaries during the year: Derwent Valley West End Ltd by 2.0m and Derwent Valley Property Trading Ltd by 2.1m, as these entities were in a net liability position.
In accordance with IAS 36, these investments were written down to their net asset value.

The eventual liability to national insurance is dependent on: the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise: the number of equity instruments that are exercised: and the prevailing rate of national insurance at the date of exercise.
The onerous contract relates to the excess of rent payable over rent receivable on a lease at the groups previous head office which expires in 2014 and reflects the discounted present value of future net payments under that lease.
A provision is made for the potential liability for cash-settled share options based on the valuation carried out at each balance sheet date see note 13.
In addition, the bonds are secured by a floating charge over certain of the groups companies, which contain 339.1m 2008: 337.3m of the groups properties.

Secured Bonds 2026 On the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007, the Secured Bonds 2026 were included at fair value less acquisition costs.
This difference from its principal value is being amortised through the income statement.
The fair value shown in note 27 was determined by the mid-price of 101.31 per 100.00 as at 31st December 2009 2008: 89.36 per 100.00.
Hedged debt The hedged debt consists of interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates and the fixed rates payable if the swaps were to be replaced on 31st December 2009 for the period to the contracted expiry dates.
The fair value of the interest rate cap represents the net cost of replacement on identical terms at prices prevailing on 31st December 2009.

There have been no transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2009 or 2008.
Financial instruments risk management The group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks: credit risk: fair value or cash flow interest rate risk: and liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The following describes the groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
Further information on risk as required by IFRS 7 is given on pages 42 and 53.
There have been no substantive changes in the groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods.
The company has the same risk profile as the group except tenant credit risk, which does not exist in the company and therefore no separate discussion has been made of the company.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2009 94 Notes to the financial statements 1 27 Financial assets and liabilities continued Financial instruments risk management continued Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are trade receivables, cash at bank, bank overdrafts, trade and other payables, floating rate bank loans, secured bonds, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
General objectives, policies and processes The board has overall responsibility for the determination of the groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to executive management.
The overall objective of the board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the groups flexibility and its ability to maximise returns.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The group is mainly exposed to credit risk from its lease contracts.
It is group policy to assess the credit risk of new tenants before entering contracts.
The board has established a credit committee which assesses each new tenant before a new lease is signed.
The review includes the latest sets of financial statements, external ratings, when available, and in some cases forecast information and bank and trade references.
The covenant strength of each tenant is determined based on this review and, if appropriate, a deposit or alternatively a guarantee is obtained.
As the group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the wide range of tenants from a broad spectrum of business sectors.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions only independently rated parties with minimum rating of investment grade are accepted.
This risk is reduced by the short periods that money is on deposit at any one time.
The group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
The quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables which are neither past due nor impaired are disclosed in note 22.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Market risk Market risk arises from the groups use of interest bearing instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates interest rate risk.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk The group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from borrowings at variable rates.
It is currently group policy that between 40% and 75% of external group borrowings excluding finance lease payables are fixed rate borrowings.
Where the group wishes to vary the amount of external fixed rate debt it holds subject to it being at least 40% and no more than 75% of expected group borrowings, as noted above, the group makes use of interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
Although the board accepts that this policy neither protects the group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
During both 2009 and 2008, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.
The group monitors the interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the impact on profit or loss and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates and this would result in an increase of 0.7m 2008: 1.4m or a decrease of 0.7m 2008: 1.5m.
The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps quantitative disclosures are given in note 26.
The group generally raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient headroom in its loan facilities to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain committed facilities to meet the expected requirements.
The group also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates and hence cash flows on a portion of its long-term borrowings.
This is further explained in the fair value and cash flow interest rate risk section above.
The executive management receives rolling three-month cash flow projections on a monthly basis and three-year projections of loan balances on a regular basis as part of the groups forecasting processes.
At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The groups loan facilities are spread across a range of UK banks so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk.
The liquidity risk of the group is managed centrally by the finance department.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2009 95 Notes to the financial statements 27 Financial assets and liabilities continued Financial instruments risk management continued Capital disclosures The groups capital comprises all components of equity share capital, share premium, other reserves, retained earnings and minority interest.
The groups objectives when maintaining capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders: and to provide an above average annualised total return to shareholders.
The group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk.
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in its industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of balance sheet gearing and property gearing.
During 2009, the groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2008, was to maintain the balance sheet gearing below 80% in normal circumstances.
As was identified in last years annual report and accounts, the definition of profit and loss gearing has been changed in order to align it more closely to the groups most commonly used interest cover ratio covenant.
These three gearing ratios are defined on page 108 and are derived below: Balance sheet gearing 2009 2008 m m Total debt 742.4 875.9 Less: cash and cash equivalents 19.0 10.5 Net debt 723.4 865.4 Net assets 1,163.9 1,215.0 Balance sheet gearing 62.2% 71.2% Property gearing 2009 2008 m m Net debt 723.4 865.4 Fair value adjustment to secured bonds 18.6 19.3 Leasehold liabilities 7.4 8.6 Drawn facilities 697.4 837.5 Fair value of investment property 1,918.4 2,108.0 Property gearing 36.4% 39.7% Profit and loss gearing 2009 2008 m m Gross property income 123.8 119.0 Surrender premiums 0.1 0.2 Ground rent 1.3 1.3 Net rental income 122.4 117.5 Net finance costs 33.4 55.5 Foreign exchange gain loss 3.6 8.3 Net pension return 0.1 0.3 Finance lease cost 0.6 0.6 Non-cash amortisation 0.6 0.6 Net interest payable 37.1 47.5 Profit and loss gearing 330% 247% Amortisation of bond fair value and issue costs.

Deferred tax on the revaluation surplus is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment property portfolio as at each balance sheet date.
The calculation takes account of available indexation on the historic cost of the properties and any available capital losses.
At 31st December 2008, due to the uncertainty over their availability, 11.9m of tax losses were not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There were no such tax losses at 31st December 2009.

37 Capital commitments Contracts for capital expenditure entered into by the group at 31st December 2009 and not provided for in the accounts amounted to 31.4m 2008: 85.4m.
These contracts relate wholly to the construction, development or enhancement of the groups investment properties.
At 31st December 2009 and 31st December 2008, there were no obligations for the purchase, repair or maintenance of investment properties.
38 Contingent liabilities The company and its subsidiaries are party to cross guarantees securing the overdraft and certain bank loans.
At 31st December 2009 the maximum liability that could arise for the company from the cross guarantees amounted to 0.4m 2008: 2.3m.
Up to the point when it was refinanced during 2009, the company guaranteed its share of the principal and interest payable under a loan to Primister Limited.
The principal guaranteed under this loan was nil at 31st December 2009 2008: 2.8m and the interest payable guaranteed was nil 2008 : 0.3m pa. Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the group, the company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
