Prior to fide-designating the cross currency interest rate swap as a net investment hedge, movements in the cross currency interest rate swap due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in other comprehensive income.
Following fide-designation until maturity, such movements were re ected in pro t or loss.
Movements in the US$117m forward foreign exchange contract were re ected in pro t or loss.
The retranslation of net investment in foreign currencies is excluded from the following table.
Based on a 5% weakening in the US dollar and Euro exchange rates against sterling, the effect on pro t for the year would be as follows: 2009 2008 USD EUR USD EUR m m m m Change in pro t for the year 0.9 0.8 0.8 1.3 The Group would experience an equal and opposite foreign exchange gain should sterling weaken against the US dollar and Euro.
e Interest rate sensitivity analysis Interest on oating rate financial instruments is reset at intervals of less than one year.
The Groups exposure to interest rates arises on cash and cash equivalents, money market instruments, bank overdrafts and the bank loan.
The Eurobonds and the obligations under finance leases are xed rate financial instruments.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates, applied to average oating rate financial instrument assets and liabilities during the year, would result in the following impact on pro t or loss: 2009 2008 100 basis point increase in interest rates m m oating rate assets 3.5 3.0 oating rate liabilities 2.4 2.9 Net impact on pro t for the year 1.1 0.1 The Group would experience an equal and opposite impact on pro t should interest rates reduce by 100 basis points.
f Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Share-based payments As at 31 December 2009 the Group had three equity-based long term incentive plans for the granting of non-transferable options to certain employees and executives.
Options granted under these plans, once vested, typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.
The Tullett Prebon plc Employee Bene t Trust 2007 the EBT was established on 30 October 2007 as an employees share scheme to provide equity incentivisation to certain employees within the Group.
Shares held by the EBT are transferred to employees on completion of the awards performance criteria.
The following table summarises the share award schemes that existed at 31 December 2009 and the estimated fair values of awards when granted: Estimated Awards fair outstanding value at 2009 grant date Share award scheme Tullett Liberty Equity Incentive Plan 56,779 210-249p Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan i 2,220,930 389p Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan ii 955,512 199p Tullett Prebon plc Employee Bene t Trust 2007 iii 406,964 400-463p 3,640,185 Notes: i 2008 awards are subject to revenue, margin performance and return on capital conditions ii 2009 awards are subject to total shareholder return and return on capital conditions iii Grants were on more than one date The following table shows the number of share awards outstanding during 2009 and 2008: Number of 2009 awards Outstanding at start of the year 4,663,687 Exercised during the year 345,786 Forfeited during the year 1,633,228 Granted during the year 955,512 Outstanding at end-of-year 3,640,185 Exercisable at end-of-year 56,779 2008 Outstanding at start of the year 3,975,477 Exercised during the year 2,977,681 Forfeited during the year 232,957 Granted during the year 3,898,848 Outstanding at end-of-year 4,663,687 Exercisable at end-of-year 56,779 The weighted average exercise price for all awards in 2008 and 2009 was nil.

Share-based payments continued The estimated fair value of each option granted in the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan 2008 and Tullett Liberty Equity Incentive Plan schemes were calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, expected life of the option until exercise and a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity pro le.
The estimated fair value of the awards in the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan 2009, which is subject to market conditions, was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, expected life of the option until exercise, the volatility and correlation of Total Shareholder Return with a comparator group of companies and a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity pro le.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Bene t Trust 2007 was calculated based on the share price at grant date, adjusted for the non-accumulation of dividends.
The model inputs for each share option scheme that existed during 2009 are set out below: Tullett Prebon Tullett Prebon Long Term Long Term Tullett Liberty Incentive Plan Incentive Plan Equity 2009 2008 Incentive Plan Share price at date of grant p i 284 430 208-263 Exercise price p nil nil nil Expected volatility 58% 46% 30% Expected life years 3 3 3 Risk free rate 2.2% 5.0% 4.5% Expected dividend yield 4.5% 3% 2% Expected volatility of comparator group 49% n a n a Correlation with comparator group 27% n a n a Proportion meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% Notes: i Tullett Liberty Equity Incentive Plan was rebased in 2006 to allow for the effect of the demerger of Collins Stewart plc The weighted average contractual life for the share-based awards outstanding as at 31 December 2009 is 7.7 years 2008: 8.2 years.

Retirement bene t obligations a fide ned bene t schemes The Group has the following fide ned bene t schemes in the UK and in North America: i The Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme fide ned Bene t Section is a fide ned bene t final salary funded pension scheme.
The Principal Employer of the scheme is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The fide ned bene t section of the scheme was closed to new members in 1991 and since May 2003 future accrual on a fide ned bene t basis has ceased.
Members in service in 1991 receive bene ts on the better of a money purchase underpin and fide ned bene t basis.
For fide ned bene t section members in service in May 2003 there is a continuing link between bene ts and pensionable pay.
ii The Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme is a fide ned bene t final salary funded pension scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members in 1989 and since April 2006 future accrual on a fide ned bene t basis has ceased.
Members receive bene ts on the better of a money purchase underpin and fide ned bene t basis.
For members in service in April 2006 there is a continuing link between bene ts and pensionable pay.
iii The Prebon Yamane US SERP C plan provides participants in North America with retirement bene ts for 10 or 15 years at a speci ed dollar amount.
The entitlement of the participants to the plan bene ts vests over time in accordance with length of service, up to a maximum period of 10 years.
SERP C was introduced in 1992 and the last participant was admitted in 1999.
The previous plan, SERP B, provided participants with a target retirement bene t, but all investment gains and losses are borne by the participant and SERP B is therefore treated as a fide ned contribution scheme.
The assets of the UK schemes are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contractbased policies of insurance.
Obligations arising under the SERP C plan are met from the Groups assets.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the UK fide ned bene t schemes during 2010 is 8.0m.
The latest actuarial valuations of the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme and of the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme together, the UK fide ned bene t schemes were carried out as at 30 April 2007 and 1 January 2007 respectively by independent quali ed actuaries.
The present value of the vested liabilities under the Prebon Yamane US SERP C are recalculated using an appropriate discount rate and the necessary additional accrual or release of accrual is made as a pension cost.
As at 31 December 2009 the SERP C liability included in the balance sheet within long term payables was 0.7m 2008: 0.9m.
Tullett Prebon plc 75 Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 35.
Retirement bene t obligations continued The main financial assumptions used by the independent quali ed actuaries of the UK fide ned bene t schemes to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2009 2008 % % Key assumptions used: Discount rate 5.70 6.10 Expected return on schemes assets 7.05 6.41 Expected rate of salary increases 5.05 4.05 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 3.60 2.70 In ation assumption 3.80 2.80 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive xed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2007 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in future at age 60 will live on average for a further 29 years 2008: 30 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years 2008: 31 years after retirement if they are female.
For the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme the equivalent assumptions are 30 years 2008: 30 years for males and 31 years 2008: 31 years for females.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a consistent but generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
The assets in the UK fide ned bene t schemes and the expected rates of return were: 2009 2008 Expected 2009 Expected 2008 return Assets return Assets % m % m Equities 7.40 123.5 6.70 92.3 Corporate bonds 5.70 9.7 6.10 8.2 Cash and other 0.70 4.5 2.70 6.4 Weighted average return 7.05 6.41 Total fair value of schemes assets 137.7 106.9 The overall expected rate of return on the schemes assets is a weighted average of the individual expected rates of return on each asset class.
