4 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the pro t for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes treasury shares and the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans and includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share plans.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
