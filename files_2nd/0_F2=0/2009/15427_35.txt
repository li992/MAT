In the prior year the 23.7m charge to equity comprised 23.5m credited directly to equity in respect of deferred tax on actuarial losses on the defined benefit pension scheme taken to the statement of recognised income and expense and a charge of 47.2m to equity in respect of the write off of the deferred tax asset on retirement benefit obligations.
The Group also reduced its deferred tax assets in the prior year on losses, capital allowances, short term timing differences and inventory write downs to reflect the weakening market and worsening economic conditions.
The deferred tax liability on brands was eliminated in 2008 following the decision to fully impair those brands.
