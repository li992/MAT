Trade and other receivables continued The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in property repair and maintenance costs in the consolidated income statement see note 5.
Amounts provided for are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The loan due from Mornington included within other receivables has been impaired and the provision of 4.8m is included within the provision for impairment of loans receivable on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivables mentioned above.
Tenant deposits of 3.6m 2008: 3.3m are held which provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused by the tenant.
In addition the loan to Mornington is secured as described above.
The group does not hold any other collateral as security.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments Financial risk management The group's objectives for managing financial risk are to minimise the risk of adverse effects on performance and to ensure the ability of the group to continue as a going concern while securing access to cost effective finance and maintaining flexibility to respond quickly to opportunities which arise.
The group's policies on financial risk management are approved by the board of directors and implemented by group treasury.
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance is monitored by internal auditors.
Group treasury reports to the risk committee.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, house price risk in relation to the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets and capital risk management.
Categories of financial instruments A summary of the classifications of the financial assets and liabilities held by the group is set out in the following table: 2009 2008 Fair value Fair value Book value Fair value adjustment Book value Fair value adjustment m m m m m m Financial interest in property assets 109.1 109.1 - 121.2 121.2 - 17.8 17.8 - Trade and other receivables 21.1 21.1 - Derivative financial instruments 0.2 0.2 - 11.9 11.9 - Cash and cash equivalents 28.3 28.3 - 43.2 43.2 - Total financial assets 155.4 155.4 - 197.4 197.4 - Non-current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 1,557.0 1,565.8 8.8 1,635.4 1,644.8 9.4 Trade and other payables 4.0 4.0 - 4.0 4.0 - Provisions for other liabilities and charges 0.9 0.9 - 1.0 1.0 - Current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 19.9 19.9 - 17.9 17.9 - Trade and other payables 11.2 11.2 - 17.0 17.0 - Derivative financial instruments 99.5 99.5 - 13.4 13.4 - Total financial liabilities 1,692.5 1,701.3 8.8 1,688.7 1,698.1 9.4 Total net financial liabilities 1,537.1 1,545.9 8.8 1,491.3 1,500.7 9.4 83 The fair value adjustment relates to the group's fixed rate loan with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and the liability component of the convertible bond, both of which are stated at amortised cost in the consolidated balance sheet.
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the statutory balance sheet.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterparty's failure to honour its obligations.
The group's principal financial assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and financial derivatives.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the group's maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
The group's financial interest in property assets relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of England Pensions Board as mortgagee, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
The group's principal credit risk relates to trade receivables.
Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful a provision for impairment is made.
For all Assured Shorthold Tenancies credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant.
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent.
Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk.
Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account the risk to the group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables is considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the group's policies of monitoring counterparty exposure, concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good financial standing.
Cash and short-term deposits at 30 September 2009 amounted to 28.3m 2008: 43.2m.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with Aor better credit ratings.
At 30 September 2009, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives which had a positive value was 0.2m 2008: 11.9m.
All the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings.
At 30 September 2009, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits and interest rate swaps was 305.4m 2008: 306.3m which represents 15.7% 2008: 14.5% of total assets.
At 30 September 2009, the loan advanced to Mornington Capital Special Situations Coinvestment Fund 1 Limited Partnership was impaired on the basis of discounted future cashflows see note 24.
Liquidity risk The group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the group's core funding is supported by covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in the group of obligors and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the group level the loan is not secured directly against any property allowing operational flexibility.
The group has comfortably complied with its covenants during 2009 and as at 30 September 2009 see note 2 on page 64.
The group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times.
The group uses short-term money market deposits to manage its liquidity.
The group also ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks to allow for operational flexibility and to meet committed expenditure on its developments.
The core business in particular is very cash generative from its gross rents and sales of trading properties.
In adverse trading conditions, investment sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be stopped.
Consequently, the group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The following table analyses the group's financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the balance sheet date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts will not equal the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings, derivative financial instruments, trade and other payables and provisions for liabilities and charges.
A reconciliation to the balance sheet amounts is given on pages 85 to 86.
Trade and other payables due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The cash flows are calculated using yield curves for floating rate interest-bearing liabilities.
Foreign currency related cash flows are calculated by means of the forward rates relevant to each maturity date.

Market Risk The group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, the availability of credit and house price movements relating to the CHARM portfolio.
The approach the group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The group is not exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Fair values The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
The following financial instruments were in existence as at 30 September 2009: 2009 2008 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges in hedge accounting relationships - 60.0 8.4 1.2 Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges not in hedge accounting relationships 0.2 39.5 3.5 12.2 0.2 99.5 11.9 13.4 Interest rate swaps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 30 September 2009 was 1,117.3m 2008: 1,228.3m.
The fair value movement relating to cash flow hedges not in hedge accounting relationships amounted to a charge of 38.7m 2008: charge of 11.5m.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued All of the financial derivatives included in the above table were valued by external consultants, using a discounted cash flow model and quoted market information and were checked internally using a bespoke software package.
In accordance with IAS 39, the group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair value would have been taken directly to the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective any gains or losses have been taken to equity through the cash flow hedge reserve.
A valuation was carried out at 30 September 2009 by external consultants, to calculate the market value of the group's fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between the fixed interest rates for the group's borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rate of appropriate debt instruments as a fair value adjustment.
The fair values compared to the carrying amounts of the group's fixed rate financial liabilities at are analysed below.
Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September 2009 2009 Fixed rate loan facilities 86.2 94.8 Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September 2008 2008 Fixed rate loan facilities 153.6 163.0 Interest rate risk The group's interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
This subjects the group to fair value risk as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the group seeks to cash flow hedge account where applicable.
The group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the group's hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the board to ensure compliance with this policy.
The board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current group treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2009, 93% 2008: 85% of the group's net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
As at 30 September 2009, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 60.0m 2008: net asset of 7.2m.
The movement in fair value measured in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 30 September 2009 was a charge of 38.7m 2008: charge of 11.5m.
At 30 September 2009, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 39.3m 2008: net liability of 8.7m.
The cash flows occur and enter in the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises debt hedged at 30 September 2009.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Cash flow hedged debt 2009 2008 m m Cash flow hedges maturing: Within one year - 214.2 Between one and two years 82.0 227.4 Between two and five years 958.3 565.9 Over five years 77.0 220.8 1,117.3 1,228.3 Interest rate profile - including the effect of derivatives 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 Sterling Euro Total Sterling Euro Total m m m m m m Fixed rate 59.0 27.0 86.0 133.3 20.3 153.6 Capped rate 945.2 423.6 1,368.8 862.1 366.2 1,228.3 Variable rate 81.1 53.9 135.0 235.6 46.6 282.2 1,085.3 504.5 1,589.8 1,231.0 433.1 1,664.1 At 30 September 2009, the weighted average interest rate of the sterling fixed rate debt is 5.4% 2008: 7.13%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is twelve years 2008: 9 years.
The weighted average interest rate of the euro fixed rate debt is 0.5% 2008: 0.5%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 41 years 2008: 42 years.
Based on the group's interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 2.3m 2008: 3.3m.
Similarly a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 2.3m 2008: 5.3m.
This has been calculated to include the effect of hedge accounting.
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of the group's interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
Where the group's swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements in fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
Foreign exchange risk The group's foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading performance and overseas net assets into sterling and it does not have foreign currency trading with cross border currency flows.
The group hedges foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
Profit translation is not hedged.
The group's balance sheet translation exposure is summarised below: 2009 2008 2009 2008 Euro Euro Czech Koruna Czech Koruna m m m m Gross foreign currency assets 499.1 454.4 8.5 9.2 Gross foreign currency liabilities 534.8 449.9 - - Net exposure 35.7 4.5 8.5 9.2 As at 30 September 2009 it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Euro would increase decrease the group's profit before tax by approximately 1.6m 2008 1.2m and equity by 3.6m 2008 0.5m.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued As at 30 September 2009 it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage point in the value of Sterling against the Czech Koruna would increase decrease the group's profit before tax by approximately 0.3m 2008 0.3m and equity by 0.9m 2008 0.9m.
Credit availability risk Credit availability risk relates to the group's ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional financing where necessary.
The group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom through committed borrowings House price risk The cash flows arising from the group's financial interest in property assets CHARM are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices.
However, consistent with the group's approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties the group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the group's business model.
At 30 September 2009 it is estimated that, with respect to the group's financial interest in property assets a general increase decrease of one percentage point in house prices at the balance sheet date would increase decrease the group's profit before tax by approximately 0.9m 2008 1m.
Capital risk management The board manages the group's capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the group to meet contractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing.
The group manages the level of its equity shareholders funds by means of dividends, share purchases and share issues.
Loans within the group have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
The board regularly reviews all covenants and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against key thresholds.
For the group as a whole the board does not have a specific loan to value target but it is reviewed in the context of the board's view of markets, the prospects of and risks relating to the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using the WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.
Certain group subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and therefore have externally applied capital adequacy requirements, however, these do no have any material impact on the group as a whole.
