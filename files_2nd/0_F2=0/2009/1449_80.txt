The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.6% for 2009: 7.6% in 2008 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 14% 2008: 14%.
The 2009 impairment of product marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of development projects during the year.
The 2009 impairment of other intangibles results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine and a reassessment of other future licensing and contractual income expected to be earned within our biologics business.
The 2008 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results, in part, from the settlement of the Pulmicort Respules patent litigation with Teva $115m and the at risk launch of a generic competitor to Ethyol $257m.
The 2008 impairment of other intangibles results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
These impairment charges were determined using value in use calculations applying the same considerations as above.
The post-tax weighted average cost of capital was 7.6%.
The remaining $144m impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of projects in development during the year.
The impairment in 2007 was in relation to the termination of a product in development acquired with MedImmune and four collaboration agreements.
