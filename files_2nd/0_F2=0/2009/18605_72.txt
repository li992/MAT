Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2007.
This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger plc in 2003.

Pension benefits for deferred members are based on the members' final pensionable salaries and service at the date employment ceased or date of leaving if earlier.
The company has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenditure SORIE.
