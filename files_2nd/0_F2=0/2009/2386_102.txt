Financial statements BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Supplementary information on oil and natural gas unaudited Operational and statistical information The following tables present operational and statistical information related to production, drilling, productive wells and acreage.
Crude oil and natural gas production The following table shows crude oil and natural gas production for the years ended 31 December 2009, 2008 and 2007. a Production for the year Europe North South Africa Asia Australasia Total America America Rest of Rest of North Rest of UK Europe US America Russia Asia Subsidiaries b Crude oil thousand barrels per day 2009 168 40 665 8 61 304 123 31 1,400 2008 173 43 538 9 66 277 128 29 1,263 2007 201 51 513 8 74 195 228 34 1,304 c Natural gas million cubic feet per day 2009 618 16 2,316 263 2,492 621 610 514 7,450 2008 759 23 2,157 245 2,532 484 696 381 7,277 2007 768 29 2,174 255 2,543 468 609 376 7,222 Equity-accounted entities BP share b Crude oil thousand barrels per day 2009 101 840 194 1,135 2008 92 826 220 1,138 2007 77 832 201 1,110 c Natural gas million cubic feet per day 2009 392 601 42 1,035 2008 454 564 39 1,057 2007 429 451 41 921 a Production excludes royalties due to others, whether payable in cash or in kind, where the royalty owner has a direct interest in the underlying production and the option and ability to make lifting and sales arrangements independently.
b Crude oil includes natural gas liquids and condensate.
c Natural gas production excludes gas consumed in operations.
Productive oil and gas wells and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2009.
A gross well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves: while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.
These tables do not include any information relating to our recent entry into Iraq.

If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.
