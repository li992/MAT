123 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2009 1 Statement of accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom and the provisions of the Companies Act.
They have been prepared on the historical cost basis where appropriate.
These financial statements set out the position of the Company and not the Cable & Wireless Group the Group which it heads.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The Company is exempt from adopting FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
As such, the Company is exempt from the requirement to provide its own financial instruments disclosures on the grounds that they are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements which include disclosures that comply with that standard.
1.2 Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
FRS 18 Accounting Policies requires that a description of the impact of any change in estimation techniques should be provided where the change has a material impact on the reported results for the period.
1.3 Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet at valuation.
This valuation has been performed using a discounted cash flow based valuation on a triennial basis.
The Directors believe this method is the most appropriate method of valuation for these assets.
Investments in joint ventures are included in the balance sheet at cost.
1.4 Financial instruments Financial assets The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The Company currently does not classify any financial assets as held-to-maturity investments.
The basis of determining note 1.5. fair values is set out in Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.
Financial assets at fair value through the income statement This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through the income statement at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within a year of the balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the reporting date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Receivables Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable receipts that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a third party with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than one year after the balance sheet date these are classified as non-current assets.
Receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is determined using the effective interest method less allowance for impairment.
An allowance for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the allowance is recognised in the income statement.
Financial statements Company 124 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2009 1.4 Financial assets and liabilities continued Recognition and measurement Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and are subsequently carried at fair value.
Receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets not carried at fair value through the income statement are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether it is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
This loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised on these instruments are not reversed through the income statement if the fair value of the instrument increases in a later period.
Loans Loans are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the loans using the effective interest method.
Convertible bonds issued by the Company were initially recognised at fair value.
The bond was separated into a liability and equity component.
The liability component was recognised at amortised cost.
The equity component represented the residual of the fair value of the bond less the liability component.
The liability component was subsequently measured on an amortised cost basis.
Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
1.5 Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company is the current bid price.
The appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Company uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.
The nominal value less estimated impairments of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Company for similar financial instruments.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.
1.6 Pensions The Company is a member of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme but is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the Companys income statement represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
The Company also operates an unfunded pension plan to cover the costs of former Directors and other senior employees pension entitlements.
Provision is made in accordance with FRS 17 in the Companys financial statements for the expected costs of meeting the associated liabilities.
These costs are recorded in operating expenses.
Costs in respect of the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis as contributions become payable.
1.7 Tax The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
125 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
1.8 Share-based compensation The Company operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, service, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The expense recognised by the Company relates only to the Company employees.
Share-based expenses relating to grants of the Companys equity made to employees of subsidiary companies are recognised in the income statement of the subsidiary.
The Company recognised these as increases in the investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase recognised in reserves.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
Where continuing employees withdraw from share-based compensation plans the remaining charge is recognised immediately.
1.9 Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and purchase of own shares by the Company The financial statements of the Company include the assets and related liabilities of the Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust, which holds shares for the Groups ESOP.
Under the requirements of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, the shares held by the Trust are stated at cost and deducted from shareholders funds.
Shares purchased by the Company are held as treasury shares at cost and deducted from shareholders funds until they are cancelled, sold for cash or transferred out of treasury pursuant to an employees share scheme.
Treasury shares do not carry voting rights and no dividends will be paid on these shares.

Each bond entitled the holder to convert the amount of such bond into fully paid ordinary shares of 25 pence each at an amended rate of 689.655 ordinary shares for each 1,000 held at an initial conversion price of 145 pence per ordinary share at any time prior to 9 July 2010.
Full conversion of the bonds would have resulted in an additional 177, 733,748 shares being issued.
During 2007 08, all of the convertible bonds in issue at 31 March 2007 were either repurchased or converted carrying value of 213 million.

13 Pension scheme The Company is a member of a Group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the scheme has been accounted for in these financial statements as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt as at 31 March 2007.
The ordinary contribution for the year was 10 million 2007 08 9 million.
A further contribution of 10 million was made in September 2008 as part of the UK pensioner buy-in transaction.
In 2007 08, a contribution of 19 million was made in order to fund the scheme fully on an actuarial basis based on the March 2007 valuation.
It has been agreed that an employer contribution rate of 28.5% 2007 08 28.5% of pensionable pay will be made from 1 April 2007.
Further details of the scheme are set out in note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.
The Company also operates unfunded pension plans to cover the costs of former Directors and other senior employees pension entitlements.
Provision is made in the Companys financial statements for the expected costs of meeting the associated liabilities and is disclosed as the retirement benefit obligation on the Companys balance sheet.
The major assumptions used in this valuation at the end of the year were: 2008 09 2007 08 % % Inflation assumption 3.0 3.5 Rate of increase in salaries 3.5 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.2 to 3.0 2.3 to 3.4 Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.7 6.8 In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Financial statements Company 134 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2009 22 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Guarantees given by the Company at the end of the financial year for which no provision has been made in the financial statements are as follows: 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Trading guarantees 399 102 Other guarantees 401 203 Total guarantees 800 305 Trading guarantees principally comprise performance bonds for contracts concluded in the normal course of business, guaranteeing that the Group companies will meet their obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.
The nature of contracts includes projects, service level agreements, installation of equipment, surveys, purchase of equipment and transportation of materials.
The guarantees contain a clause that they will be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the contract.
Other guarantees include guarantees for financial obligations principally in respect of borrowings, leases and letters of credit.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
The principal other guarantees given by the Company are for the 200 million 2019 bond issued by Cable & Wireless International Finance BV and the 99 million drawn down under Worldwides 200 million bank facility.
Whilst Pender, the Groups former insurance operation, ceased to underwrite new business from April 2003, it has in the past written policies in favour of the Group and third parties.
Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and potential disputes with reinsurers.
Significant progress has been made in resolving these claims in the year.
Detail of these insurance claims and potential claims are not disclosed as such disclosure may be prejudicial to the outcome of such claims.
In addition the Company has, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years.
Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given.
The Company also gives warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements and general commercial agreements.
Some of these agreements do not contain liability caps.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed governing the main UK Pension Fund, the Company guarantees the performance of the obligations of other Group companies which are participating employers in the Fund.
Whilst the Company ceased participation in the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, it may be liable for future contributions to fund a portion of any future funding deficits.
Currently, the amount of these potential liabilities cannot be quantified.
