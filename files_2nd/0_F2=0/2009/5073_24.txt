PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The Parent Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed below, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Companys profit and loss account is not presented in these financial statements.
The eaga plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2009 contain a consolidated cash flow statement, consequently, the Company has taken the exemption available in FRS1 Revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements, and has not presented its own cash flow statement.
Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives on the following rates: Land and buildings 2% Alterations to leasehold property Period of lease Fixtures and fittings 20-33.3% Equipment 20-50% A tangible fixed asset is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset is recognised in the period the asset is fide-recognised.
Assets residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs incurred on the acquisition of tangible fixed assets are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Fixed Asset Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out basis and comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the balance sheet date.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Leases Operating leases with annual rentals, net of any incentives received, are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Pension Scheme The Company operates a number of defined contribution plans.
The Company pays contributions to corporate or individually administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Company has no further obligation under these plans once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Foreign Currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at year-end exchange rates.

PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Share-based Payments The Company allows employees to acquire its shares through share option schemes, details of which are in the Remuneration Committee Report.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market-based performance not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Company also operates a SIP under which qualifying Partners may receive free shares.
The fair value of the free shares is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the shares.
Financial Instruments Debtors and creditors are non-derivative financial assets or liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are included within assets or liabilities at cost less impairment depending on when they fall due.
Accrued Income Accrued income represents turnover that has not yet been invoiced to the customer.
