During the period no new options were granted.
Options over 1,619,455 new ordinary 1p shares and 1,572,600 purchased ordinary 1p shares were exercised.
In order to reduce the number of shares required by the ESOP to satisfy share awards, the Company agreed with employees that the number of shares required on the exercise of purchase options be reduced.
To ensure that employees were not disadvantaged by this reduction, the exercise prices applied on the exercise of the options were correspondingly reduced.
The effect of the reductions to the exercise prices was to reduce the weighted average exercise price on all options exercised from 123p to 48p.
These reductions in exercise prices were not applied to options exercised over subscription shares.
