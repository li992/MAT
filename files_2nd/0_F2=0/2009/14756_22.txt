IFRS 2: Share based payments: vesting conditions and cancellations.
The amendment to IFRS 2 clarifies the term vesting conditions and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and cancellations.
Non-vesting conditions must be taken into account in the estimation of the fair value of the instrument at the grant date, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period must be treated as a cancellation.
The amount of the compensation cost that otherwise would be recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately on cancellation, normally in profit and loss.
If the share-based payment includes a liability component, then the liability is remeasured to fair value at the date of cancellation prior to its settlement.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material effect on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee: Interpretations IFRIC 14: IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Paragraph 58 of IAS 19 Employee Benefits limits the measurement of a defined benefit asset to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
IFRIC 14 addresses the interaction between a minimum funding requirement and the limit placed by paragraph 58 of IAS 19 on the measurement of the defined benefit asset or liability.
Under IFRIC 14, entities are required to measure any economic benefits available to them in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions at the maximum amount that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the plan and any statutory requirements in the jurisdiction of the plan.
The impact of IFRIC 14 on the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2009 has been assessed as detailed in note 17: IFRIC 14 will be adopted by the Group for the financial year commencing 1 April 2009.

One-off charges during 2008 European Supply Chain restructuring During the prior financial year, the Group announced several phases of restructuring projects with regard to the European Supply Chain, and the early repayment of loan notes and early settlement of related derivative balances.
The key aspects of the restructuring programme were: Closure of the Spanish manufacturing plant in Rubi, with transfer of production to India and Thailand: Closure of the Technical Services Centre in Cambridge, with its activities transferred to the technical centres at Peterlee, Thailand and India: Restructuring of the Footwear Development Group: and Closure of the Guernsey manufacturing facility, with production to be transferred to the Peterlee facility or to third-party suppliers.
The one-off charges to operating profit during 2008 were 41.3 million with regards to the closures of the manufacturing and technical services facilities and the restructuring of the Footwear Development Group, and 5.2 million one-off financial expenses relating to the early repayment of loan notes and early settlement of related derivatives.

The increase in income tax losses in the year of 44.4 million is explained by a foreign currency retranslation difference of 54.5 million on losses carried forward at 2008, net of a decrease in losses carried forward of 10.1 million.
It is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
Included in the losses are US income tax losses of USD 102 million 2008: USD 120 million which are unlikely to be available for use due to the change of ownership restrictions.
50.0 million 2008: 44.9 million of income tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The remaining losses held in overseas entities may expire over periods of up to 20 years.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of the 69.1 million 2008: 43.1 million of unremitted earnings of non-UK subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary timing difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.

The assets under construction at 31 March 2009 relate to the factory being built in China, and the expansion of the manufacturing facilities in Thailand.
As assets are transferred onto SAP, fully written down assets are removed from the system.
This is the main driver of the high level of disposals during the current and prior year.
The current year disposals also include the write off of assets in Guernsey and Rubi, Spain which have been charged against the European Supply Chain restructuring provision.

For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as several cash-generating units, one for each component of goodwill recognised at the balance sheet date, and one for all other consumer products.
The cash-generating units recoverable amounts are based on value in use calculations using projections of the Groups performance over 1015 years, periods reflecting the Directors best estimates of the cash flows.
Key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in revenues and direct costs during the period.
Risk adjusted pre-tax discount factors of 11.412.0 per cent 2008: 910.4 per cent have been applied to the projections.
The pre-tax discount rate has been based on managements calculation of the pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to calculate the cost of equity.
A range of alphas were used to reflect the risk of the cash-generating units.
The Directors do not believe that a reasonably possible change of assumptions would cause the recoverable amounts to fall below book value for any of the following material assets.
Further details are provided below for material assets.
Material assets Scholl brand The Scholl brand, with a carrying value of 61.4 million at 31 March 2009 2008: 60.8 million, is not amortised.
The brand has been tested for impairment using the method described below.
No charge for impairment was required in the year.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the Scholl brand, the Group is regarded as two cash-generating units, that part relating to Schollbranded products and that relating to all other consumer products.
The Scholl brands recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the brand using the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results: Revenue growth was anticipated at 2 per cent 2008: 2 per cent per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years.
This is considered a conservative medium-term assumption based on prior performance: Operating results were then held at the year ten figures into perpetuity reflecting the Directors assertion that the brand has an indefinite useful economic life based upon its proven value over long periods and its position in the market which is considered sustainable for the foreseeable future: and A risk adjusted discount factor of 11.4 per cent 2008: 9.0 per cent was applied to the projections.
For the Scholl brand to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 22 per cent before the brands value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 12.9 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 12.6 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Goodwill arising on acquisition of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited China Goodwill Goodwill denominated in Chinese Renminbi arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited in January 2007.
The carrying value of the goodwill at 31 March 2009 is 26.4 million 2008: 17.2 million.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the China goodwill, the Chinese commercial business and manufacturing entities of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited and SSL Healthcare Shanghai Limited were identified as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results: Revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent 2008: 3 per cent per annum, based on medium to long-term forecasts, with operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years.
This is in line with historic experience: Operating results were then held at the year ten figures into perpetuity reflecting the expected maintenance of the position in the market: and A risk adjusted discount factor of 12.0 per cent 2008: 10.4 per cent was applied to the projections.
For the China goodwill to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 61 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 22.2 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 2.7 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
Vasyli goodwill and intangible assets The Vasyli business was acquired in November 2007, with goodwill of 12.8 million initially recognised on acquisition.
During the current financial year, the Directors have reviewed the contingent consideration payable in June 2010, as detailed in note 16, and consequently the goodwill relating to the Vasyli business has increased to 20.7 million at 31 March 2009.
The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Vasyli acquisition at 31 March 2009 is 3.1 million 2008: 3.5 million.
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2009 in relation to the revised goodwill of 20.7 million.
The Vasyli business, encompassing sales of the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vasyli and VAS brands across the Group, was identified as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results: Cash flows for years two and three were based upon the business plan forecast operating results: Revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent 2008: 3 per cent per annum from year four to year ten, nil thereafter, and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue: Operating results were then held at the year ten figures for a further ten years reflecting the current expected useful life of the goodwill and related brands and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Vasyli business with that of Scholl footcare: and A risk adjusted discount factor of 11.8 per cent 2008: 10.4 per cent was applied to the projections.
For the Vasyli goodwill to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 29 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing all revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 23.2 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 1.4 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
The remaining goodwill is made up of a number of balances, all individually less than 3.9 million, with a total net book value of 11.1 million.
Impairment reviews have been performed in respect of all balances held.
Other intangible assets includes 6.9 million 2008: 6.3 million relating to software development and licences, and a number of other balances all under 3.0 million individually.

Sirius Global Solutions Limited is an unquoted entity, therefore fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily ascertained: the investment is therefore held at initial cost and subject to annual impairment review.
On 19 May 2008 the Group completed the first stage of its investment in  Lemore BV, BLBV, acquiring a 15.5 per cent stake for 30.7 million including acquisition costs, with the ability to purchase the remainder exercisable at future dates over the next two years.
The investment is classed as a financial asset available for sale and is held at fair value.
The Directors consider that fair value approximates to cost at 31 March 2009.
The Directors concluded that it was not appropriate to account for the investment in BLBV as an associate because the Group holds less than 20 per cent of the voting power, had no representation on the Board of BLBV, and the options to purchase the remainder of BLBV were not exercisable at the balance sheet date: it was concluded that the Group does not exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions of BLBV.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15.
Borrowings and derivative financial liabilities continued The principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Overdrafts and facilities of 13.5 million 2008: 10.9 million are unsecured.
Various overdraft facilities exist across the Group, including a UK facility of 7.5 million 2008: 7.5 million net.
The average effective interest rate on bank overdraft approximates 1.25 per cent 2008: 4.7 per cent per annum.
The Group has the following bank facilities: A syndicated Group facility of 220 million available until January 2012, of which 137.4 million 2008: 123.0 million had been drawn down at 31 March 2009.
Drawdowns can be made for periods of one, two, three or six months, or any other mutually-agreed term in any currency: interest rates are set at the corresponding LIBOR plus 50 basis points at the time of the drawdown: The individual drawdowns under the Group facility at 31 March 2009 all had repayment dates in April 2009: however, at the balance sheet date, the Group had the ability to roll over these drawdowns, and expects that they all would be rolled over for at least 12 months.
As a result, the borrowings under the facility were classed as non-current.
At 31 March 2008, the individual drawdowns all had repayment dates within 12 months of the balance sheet date: however, there was uncertainty as to the funding requirements of the Group for the year ahead, specifically with regards to the acquisition of  Lemore BV note 9, and whether equity finance might be raised during the forthcoming year.
In light of the uncertainty as to whether any of the drawdowns would be rolled over for more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, all drawdowns at 31 March 2008 were disclosed within current liabilities: and SSL Healthcare Italia SpA has fixed rate unsecured loans of 10.2 million 2008: 8.8 million which are rolled forward every three months: as there is no committed facility, these loans are disclosed within current liabilities.
Undrawn borrowing facilities At 31 March 2009, the Group had available 82.6 million 2008: 97.0 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Bank loans and interest rate swaps held as a cash flow hedge 2009 2008 m m 60 million Sterling drawdown on Group facility at one month LIBOR of 1.6 per cent 2008: 6.266.29 per cent 60.0 60.0 Interest rate swaps: three month LIBOR to fixed 5.46 per cent 3.8 0.8 Interest rate basis swaps: three month LIBOR to one month LIBOR 0.2 0.1 64.0 60.7 Within the total facility drawndown of 137.4 million, 60.0 million has been hedged from a floating to fixed interest rate.
The 60.0 million drawdowns on the Group facility designated as part of the cash flow hedge relationship are for periods of one month, repayable in April 2009, and therefore are held at notional value which is deemed equivalent to fair value.
The interest rate swaps are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value totalling 3.2 million 2008: 0.7 million have been charged directly to equity in relation to fair value movements in the interest rate swaps during the year ended 31 March 2009.
Changes in fair value of 0.1 million 2008: nil previously credited directly to equity have been recycled through profit and loss in the current year.
The cash flow hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
Bank loans held as a net investment hedge The Japanese Yen drawdown on the Group Facility of 6.5 million, 913 million Yen 2008: 4.6 million, 913 million Yen is designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups investment in subsidiaries denominated in Japanese Yen.
As explained in note 19, the net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
Obligations under finance leases Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate.
The average lease term outstanding is one year.
For the year ended 31 March 2009, the average effective borrowing rate was 6.7 per cent 2008: 7.1 per cent.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
The lease obligations are denominated in Thai Baht, and the fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.

Benefits accrue with service and are payable to employees upon departure from the Group regardless of the reason for such departure.
Benefits may be calculated with reference to an average salary over the service life of the employee or the final salary of the employee.
Differences arising due to changes in assumptions in calculating the liability for employees are taken through equity in accordance with IAS 19 and are included above within exchange and other movements.
The main assumptions underlying the calculation on a weighted average basis across the various schemes are salary increases of 3.0 per cent, an inflation rate of 2.0 per cent and a discount rate of 6.9 per cent.
The calculation of the provision is determined by contractual obligation.
No terminations are expected in the forthcoming year.
Provision is also made for termination payments which may be required for sales agents.
At the year end an amount of 1.0 million was provided 2008: 1.0 million.
The amount provided is based upon payments which would be required under collective agreements to sales agents upon termination of their contracts by the Group.
Increases and decreases in the provision, aside from utilisation, are reflected within the income statement.
Disposals Following the Groups disposal of the medical business, in 2004 and 2005, a number of disposal provisions were created for the ongoing commitments of the Group in respect of the disposals.
The Group had utilised the majority of these provisions during previous years, with the residual balance transferred into environmental provisions included within the other category during the prior financial year.
Manufacturing restructuring During 2005 the Group announced its decision to close the Derby manufacturing plant and transfer production to India.
This process was completed during the year ended 31 March 2008.
Group and commercial restructuring The Group completed its previous rationalisation and restructuring of commercial operations during the prior financial year.
European Supply Chain restructuring During the prior financial year, as part of the European Supply Chain restructuring detailed in note 2, provisions of 41.3 million were made in relation to the closure of the manufacturing facilities at Rubi Spain and Guernsey, the closure of the Technical Services Centre in Cambridge, and the restructuring of the Footwear Development Group.
Following the announcement of phase 1 of this restructuring programme in September 2007, a provision of 5.2 million was recorded in relation to the early repayment of loan notes and settlement of related derivatives, giving a total provision created in the prior year of 46.5 million.
Surplus property provisions in relation to the closure of these sites of 2.6 million was transferred to the surplus property provision within the other provision.
Operations in Spain and Cambridge had ceased by 31 March 2008: operations in Guernsey ceased, and substantially all of the remaining European Supply Chain restructuring activities were completed during the current financial year, with 19.5 million of the provision utilised.
The remaining elements of the restructuring programme to be completed are the final integration and validation of plant transferred from Guernsey to Peterlee, and the disposal of the surplus owned and leased properties in Guernsey and Rubi, Spain.
The key remaining uncertainties at the balance sheet date were in relation to the disposal of these properties, for example whether the properties will be sold or sub-let, the potential proceeds receivable under either alternative, and the time period in which the disposals will be completed.
It is anticipated that all of the remaining European Supply Chain restructuring provision will be utilised within the forthcoming year, subject to property transactions being completed.
76 77 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Other Other provisions relate to a number of pre-merger environmental provisions of 1.5 million and surplus property provisions of 6.2 million.
Environmental provisions are provided for to the extent that a present obligation exists, it is probable such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably by external experts.
No provision is made for possible additional costs that are not currently probable.
The surplus property provision relates to Group commitments under non-cancellable leases which, following historical restructuring exercises, are no longer used by the Group.
The obligation, net of expected rental income, has been provided for.
Surplus property and environmental costs of 6.0 million have been included as non-current.
It is expected that all other provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration of 9.4 million relates to the acquisition of the Vasyli business during the previous financial year, and is payable in June 2010.
The consideration is contingent upon the level of Orthaheel-branded sales achieved across the Group in the year ended 31 March 2010, and is capped at AUD $42.0 million.
The amount recognised within provisions during the year ended 31 March 2009 reflects the increase in the amount which is considered probable to be paid, based on actual sales for 2008 09 and detailed budgets and growth forecasts for 2009 10.
There are inherent uncertainties in deriving sales forecasts, as the Group has introduced Orthaheel products into several new markets during 2008 09, and will launch these products into further new territories in 2009 10.
The level of contingent consideration will be reassessed at each reporting date to reflect revisions to forecasts or differences between budget and actual sales performance.
Post-retirement benefits The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in the UK and overseas.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants and no further benefits are accruing.
UK Pensions a Defined contribution schemes Since 1995, the Group has operated a contracted-in defined contribution scheme which is open to UK employees.
It also operates defined contribution executive pension plans for senior executives.
Employer contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was 1.5 million 2008: 1.3 million.
b Defined benefit schemes The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to form Seton Scholl in 1998, and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and LIG in 1999.
All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants and no further benefits are accruing.
Benefits for members who are still employed by the Group remain linked to their final earnings.
The finances of all schemes are assessed regularly by independent actuaries and all assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes provide benefits for employees as outlined below: i Seton Prior to 1995, the Group operated a defined benefit scheme for employees.
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this scheme ceased in August 1995, but existing benefits at that date are being maintained.
The latest valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 0.5 million into the scheme during the next financial year, subject to the results of the 5 April 2009 actuarial valuation for funding purposes.
ii Scholl Accrual of further service related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in August 2000, but benefits accrued to 31 August 2000 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The most recent valuation by independent actuaries was at 5 April 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 0.6 million into the scheme during the next financial year, subject to the results of the 5 April 2009 actuarial valuation for funding purposes.
iii LIG Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in January 2001, but benefits accrued to 31 January 2001 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 8.2 million into the scheme during the next financial year, subject to the results of the 31 March 2009 actuarial valuation for funding purposes.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.
Post-retirement benefits continued Overseas pensions and similar obligations The Group has a number of pension schemes in different countries, both defined benefit and defined contribution.
Defined benefit schemes are set up under separate trust funds and liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of overseas defined contribution schemes was 2.4 million 2008: 2.2 million.
Details of the material overseas defined benefit schemes are included below.
The most recent actuarial valuations for each scheme were updated for IAS 19 purposes to 31 March 2009 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries in determining the present value of the liabilities were: 2009 Seton Scholl LIG Overseas Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 3.0% Pensions increases per annum 2.9% 1.9% Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.0% Open section 1.5% Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.4% Open section 2.9% Pre April 1997 1.5% Post April 1997 2.9% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.9% 6.9% 6.9% 6.7% Inflation assumption 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 2.6% 2008 Seton Scholl LIG Overseas Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 3.6% Pensions increases per annum 3.4% 2.0% Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.0% Open section 2.6% Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.7% Open section 3.4% Pre April 1997 2.4% Post April 1997 3.4% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.0% Inflation assumption 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 2.9% For the UK schemes, the mortality assumption was updated at 31 March 2009 to include a minimum underpin for future improvements in mortality of 1.0 per cent per annum for males and 0.5 per cent per annum for females.
The assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old male retiring in the current period is 20.7 years 2008: 20.1 years and for a male retiring in 20 years at age 65, life expectancy is 22.6 years 2008: 21.2 years.
The assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old female retiring in the current period is 23.2 years 2008: 23.0 years and for a female retiring in 20 years at age 65, life expectancy is 24.4 years 2008: 24.0 years.
The expected rate of return on pension scheme assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long-term returns of the major asset classes in which the schemes invest equities, corporate bonds, and government bonds for the UK schemes, and insurance contracts for the overseas schemes weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
Based on the assumptions made and the distribution of assets, the weighted average expected return on assets as at 31 March 2009 is 6.4 per cent 31 March 2008: 6.3 per cent.
These rates are net of an allowance for investment management expenses.
An allowance for administrative expenses is included in the present value of scheme liabilities.
The expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities are recognised within the income statement within financial income and financial expenses respectively.

The share placing was enacted via the use of a new subsidiary company, SSL Capital Limited, registered in Jersey: the institutions subscribed for less than 10 per cent of the Ordinary shares and 100 per cent of Preference shares in the subsidiary, which were subsequently exchanged for an allotment of the newly issued Ordinary shares in SSL International Plc.
The increase in the merger reserve of 82.4 million arose from accounting for the share-for-share exchange in which SSL International Plc issued new Ordinary shares in exchange for the remaining Ordinary and Preference shares in SSL Capital Limited.
The merger reserve is non-distributable.
Shares issued under employee share options generated proceeds of 1.1 million 2008: 0.9 million.
The holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.

84 85 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed above.
The Group manages its capital structure through maintaining close relationships with its bankers who provide the majority of funds used for operational requirements.
The key indicator of capital management performance used by internal management is the level of net debt, which is defined as borrowings and derivative financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt is monitored on a monthly basis to ensure that actual results are in line with net debt forecasts.
The Groups main banking facility is a 220 million committed five-year revolving credit facility.
This facility was arranged in January 2007 and is committed until January 2012.
The banking syndicate comprises seven members and is administered by Barclays Bank plc.
Further information in relation to the Groups financial liabilities is given in notes 15 and 21.
A reconciliation of movements in net debt is provided in note 21.
Net debt at 31 March 2009 is 17.7 million compared with 99.0 million at 31 March 2008.
In addition, on 28 January 2009 the Group placed an additional 19.1 million Ordinary shares with institutions at a price of 455 pence per share.
The net proceeds, after placing costs, were 85.0 million.
The purpose of the share placing was to raise funds to finance the Groups acquisition activity, such as the investment in Russia, Ukraine and the rest of the CIS.
The Group is required to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA, net interest costs to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and the ratio of revenue generated from certain Group brands to total Group revenue.
The Group has met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 March 2009.
The Group has prepared forecasts of the cash flows for the next financial year which indicate that the Group, after considering all known commitments and appropriate sensitivities, will meet its covenant requirements for this period.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group may purchase its own shares on the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option and performance share plans.
During the year no shares were physically purchased from the market.
During the year 1.7 million 2008: nil was paid by the Group to satisfy the UK tax and National Insurance elements of the gross shares vesting under the performance share plan, which is disclosed as repurchase of shares in the cash flow statement.
Vested shares awarded to the individuals were net of tax and National Insurance payments.
This was equivalent to the Group purchasing its own shares on the market and awarding these to the recipients.
No risk was taken by the Group in respect of share price fluctuations, and the impact on the Group was the same as if it had acted as an agent in the sale of the shares by the individual and the individuals themselves have not received incremental benefits through this arrangement.
The Group held no treasury shares at 31 March 2009 2008: none.
Decisions to purchase shares are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board: there is no defined share buy-back plan.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
During the year, the Group issued shares to raise funds as detailed above.

Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit: liquidity: interest rate: and currency.
Further information on the Groups exposure to these risks is presented below, with an explanation of the Groups policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and review of the Groups risk management policies and procedures: these guidelines are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, including setting and monitoring compliance with appropriate limits and controls.
The policies are reviewed regularly and amended where appropriate to reflect changes in the Groups operations, risk exposure and market conditions.
The Board is assisted by the Groups Business Assurance function, which undertakes regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Groups Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer: the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, approximately 75-80 per cent of the Groups debtors are in Europe.
Group exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy, which is reviewed annually, for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, reviewing credit ratings, and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
Customer credit risk is monitored at a subsidiary level by divisional management, and is reviewed at Group level by country.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payments statistics for similar financial assets.
86 87 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Investment securities Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded derivatives.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks, in line with Group policy.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet date were 104.5 million 2008: 15 million.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2009, no guarantees were outstanding 2008: none.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risks by ensuring that any anticipated funding requirements, based on detailed cash flow forecasts at subsidiary and Group level, will be met by access to different sources of funding.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 3060 days, including the servicing of financial obligations.
In addition, the Group maintains the credit facilities detailed in note 15.
Committed undrawn facilities available to the Group in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Expiring in one year or less Expiring in more than one year and less than two years Expiring in more than two years 82.6 97.0 Total 82.6 97.0 Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, would affect the Groups income, the value of its holdings of financial instruments, or its obligations in respect of retirement benefits.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Groups entities.
Where practicable, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge major transactional exposures on working capital balances.
At the start of each financial year, the Group enters into forward contracts to hedge approximately 50 to 70 per cent of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast sales and purchases over the forthcoming financial year.
These transactions are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Interest on borrowings is primarily denominated in Sterling, such that no related foreign currency derivatives are required.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Groups investment in its Japanese subsidiary is hedged by a Japanese Yen-denominated secured bank loan which mitigates the currency risk arising from the subsidiarys net assets.
Interest rate risk The Groups variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates over the longer term: the Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps over 60.0 million of the drawndown facility.
The remaining drawndown facility of 77.4 million was at LIBOR plus 50 basis points at 31 March 2009 with all contracts ending in April 2009.
Interest rates will be reset for each tranche on the amounts redrawn in April 2009.
Other market price risk The Group does not speculate in equity securities, nor does the Group enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage requirements.
The Group holds a strategic investment of 1 million in the equity securities of an unlisted company as detailed in note 9, this is not deemed to expose the Group to market price risk, although the investment is subject to annual impairment reviews.
During the year the Group acquired an investment in BLBV, an unlisted company at a cost of 30.7 million note 9.
The cost is considered equal to fair value.
As detailed in note 25, the percentage investment in BLBV will increase from 1 June 2009 and BLBV will be consolidated from that date.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Financial risk management continued Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount Carrying amount 2009 2008 m m Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative financial assets 194.9 169.0 Available for sale financial assets 31.7 1.0 Cash and cash equivalents 147.9 44.6 Other forward exchange contracts 0.4 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount Carrying amount 2009 2008 m m United Kingdom 28.0 23.9 Europe 118.4 104.9 Asia Pacific 31.9 22.1 United States 5.6 4.0 183.9 154.9 The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Allowance for Allowance Gross impairment Gross for impairment 2009 2009 2008 2008 m m m m Trade receivables due within terms 186.7 155.2 Past due by less than 30 days 8.3 7.7 Past due 31120 days 8.0 8.4 Past due 120365 days 4.4 3.0 3.8 2.0 More than one year 4.1 4.1 3.8 3.8 211.5 7.1 178.9 5.8 Provision for rebates 20.5 18.2 Gross trade receivables note 11 191.0 160.7 Allowance for impairment 7.1 5.8 Net credit exposure 183.9 154.9 There are no customers representing more than 3.3 per cent 2008: 2.0 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairment.
Movement on the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables is disclosed in note 11.
The allowance for impairment has been determined based on historical trends, and relevant market and customer information.
The Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
All other receivables are within the respective payment contractual terms.
88 89 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements: 2009 Carrying Contractual 6 months More than amount cash flows or less 612 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Secured bank loans 137.4 137.6 0.2 137.4 Finance lease liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.1 Unsecured bank facility 10.2 10.2 10.2 Trade and other payables 163.8 163.8 163.8 Bank overdrafts 13.5 13.5 13.5 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging 0.4 0.4 0.4 Interest rate swaps used for hedging 4.0 4.0 4.0 Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and it is not deemed appropriate to allocate the cash flows across the maturity categories.
2008 Carrying Contractual 6 months More than amount cash flows or less 612 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Secured bank loans 123.0 124.5 113.9 10.6 Finance lease liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.1 Unsecured bank facility 8.8 8.9 8.9 Trade and other payables 138.8 138.8 138.0 0.8 Bank overdrafts 10.9 10.9 10.9 Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swaps used for hedging 0.8 0.8 0.8 Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and it is not deemed appropriate to allocate the cash flows across the maturity categories.
At 31 March 2009, the carrying amount for secured bank loans of 137.4 million relates to drawdowns under the syndicated Group facility.
As explained in note 15, the contractual repayment dates of each drawdown, along with accumulated interest, were in April 2009: however, at the balance sheet date, it was expected that all of these drawdowns would be rolled over for at least 12 months, and therefore classification as noncurrent liabilities at 31 March 2009 was concluded to be appropriate.
Within the table above, 0.2 million contractual cash flows relating to the interest to be paid on maturity in April 2009 have been included within the category six months or less.
The contractual cash flows relating to the underlying drawdowns of 137.4 million have been included in the category two to five years, the period in which the Group facility expires.
The interest rate swaps used for hedging at 31 March 2009 are designated in a cash flow hedge relationship against 60 million of the secured bank loans, and therefore the related cash flows will not impact upon profit or loss until the hedge relationship ceases.
Currency risk Exposure to currency risk The Groups main exposure to foreign currency risk was in respect of the Euro, based on notional amounts: 2009 2008 Exposure to Exposure to Euro risk Euro risk m m Trade receivables 111.3 95.3 Prepayments and other receivables 3.9 3.8 Trade payables 45.5 31.7 Other payables 23.9 23.8 Gross balance sheet exposure 45.8 43.6 Net exposure to currency risk with regards to other foreign currencies was not significant at 31 March 2009 or 31 March 2008.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate for the year Balance sheet date 2009 2008 2009 2008 Euro 1.2041 1.4187 1.0796 1.2543 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Financial risk management continued Sensitivity analysis A 10 per cent strengthening of Sterling against the Euro at 31 March would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and that forward contracts are not revalued.
2009 2008 Equity Profit or loss Equity Profit or loss Euro 1.0 4.1 1.6 1.1 A 10 per cent weakening of Sterling against the Euro at 31 March would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant, and that forward contracts are not revalued.
Interest rate risk Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Due to the short maturity dates of the drawdowns on the Group facility at 31 March 2009 average maturity 18 days and 31 March 2008 average maturity 51 days, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at either reporting date would have negligible impact on the carrying value of variable rate financial instruments, and similarly upon profit or loss.
The interest rate swap at 31 March 2009 and also at 31 March 2008 is included as part of a cash flow hedge relationship, therefore any change in interest rates at the reporting date would have no impact upon profit or loss for the year, only upon the amount recognised in equity within the cash flow hedge reserve and the carrying value of derivative financial liabilities on the balance sheet.
Fair values Fair values versus carrying amounts The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, are as follows: 2009 2008 m m m m Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Derivatives held at fair value Interest rate swaps used for hedging liabilities net 4.0 4.0 0.7 0.7 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 Instruments held at fair value Available for sale financial assets 31.7 31.7 1.0 1.0 Instruments held at amortised cost Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative financial assets 194.9 194.9 169.0 169.0 Cash and cash equivalents 147.9 147.9 44.6 44.6 Secured bank loans 137.4 137.4 123.0 123.0 Finance lease liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Unsecured bank facilities 10.2 10.2 8.8 8.8 Trade and other payables 163.8 163.8 138.8 138.8 Bank overdrafts 13.5 13.5 10.9 10.9 45.1 45.1 67.3 67.3 Unrecognised gain loss Basis for determining fair values The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.
Available for sale financial assets The available for sale financial assets at 31 March 2009 are unquoted entities, therefore fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily ascertained.
Both investments are therefore held at initial cost, which is deemed to be comparable to fair value, although the investments are subject to annual impairment review.
90 91 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate based on government bonds.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes.
Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
In respect of finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
The carrying values of all borrowings are equal to the fair values due to the relatively short contractual maturity dates and variable interest rates.
Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Financial instruments a Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents, as detailed in note 12, comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits.
These are placed on terms not exceeding three months.
62.9 million is held at variable rates and 85.0 million at fixed rates at 31 March 2009 2008: 42.5 million at variable rates and 2.1 million at fixed rates respectively.
Financial liabilities The Groups fixed rate financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups variable rate financial derivatives and variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cashflows due to changes in interest rates.
Hedging At 31 March 2009, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 122.4 million 2008: 133.0 million.
Interest rate swaps including those in effective fair value hedging relationships are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
The fair value of interest and currency swaps recognised as hedges at 31 March 2009 is a net liability of 4.0 million comprising liabilities of 4.0 million 2008: net liability of 0.7 million comprising assets of 0.1 million and liabilities of 0.8 million.
Up to the repayment of the loan notes and settlement of related swaps in November 2007, interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance costs.
Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships were adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through the income statement to offset any mark-to-market arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation was prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness testing was carried out semi-annually.
All designated hedges remained effective throughout the prior financial year to the point of settlement.
The maturity dates of all financial liabilities, together with details of their nominal interest rates, fair values and carrying values are disclosed in note 15. b Foreign currency risk The Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 2009 2008 Total Total m m Cash and cash equivalents Sterling 110.1 16.2 US Dollar 4.3 1.6 Euro 7.5 4.5 Other 26.0 22.3 Total 147.9 44.6 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23.
