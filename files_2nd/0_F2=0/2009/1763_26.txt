This definition is referred to as Underlying EBITA.
In order to ensure that it continues to provide a measure of profitability that is comparable over time, it has been amended to exclude all non-recurring items.
Underlying EBITA continues to be the measure of profit on which segmental performance is monitored by management.
As such, it is disclosed in note 3 on a segmental basis.
Non-recurring items are defined as items that are relevant to an understanding of the Groups performance with reference to their materiality, nature and function.
The non-recurring items for the current and prior years are presented on the face of the Groups consolidated income statement.

The amounts are not considered material for the restatement of comparative information.
5 Goodwill arising on the formation of the BVT joint venture in the year ended 31 December 2008 and goodwill associated with the Groups initial 50% shareholding in Fleet Support Limited has been reclassified from equity accounted investments to intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, in 2009 upon acquisition of VT Groups 45% shareholding in the BVT joint venture.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
The Groups approach to goodwill impairment testing is set out in the accounting policies on page 125.
Impairment testing The Groups goodwill of 10.2bn 2008 10.9bn is allocated across 23 cash-generating units CGUs.
In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to value in use calculations.
These calculations use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Groups five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with an inflationary growth rate assumption applied.
The IBP process uses historic experience, available government spending data and the Groups order book.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.72% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.
Intangible assets continued Significant CGUs The Group has three CGUs with allocated goodwill which is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
These are the US-based electronic warfare, network and mission solutions business in the Electronics, Intelligence & Support EI&S operating group 2.6bn, and the US-based ex-United Defense Industries, Inc. UDI 2.0bn and ex-Armor Holdings, Inc. Armor 1.7bn pre-impairment below businesses in the Land & Armaments operating group.
The key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections for the EI&S CGU are the continuing demand from the US government for electronic warfare systems, mission solutions and other technology-based solutions, and from non-military agencies for network solutions.
The key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections for the Land & Armaments CGUs are the continued demand in the Groups home markets and from exports for existing and successor military land and tracked vehicles, upgrade programmes and support.
The pre-tax discount rates used to discount the risk-adjusted five-year cash flow projections were 9.9%, 9.8% and 10.3%, respectively.
The growth rate assumption applied to the final year of these projections was 3% 2% for Armor, reduced from 4% in the prior year reflecting increased uncertainty in the US defence budgets.
Whilst there are no other CGUs with allocated goodwill balances exceeding 15% of the Groups total goodwill balance, the majority of the projected cash flows within the remaining CGUs are underpinned by the expected continuation of levels of government spending on aerospace, defence and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
The directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes relating either specifically to the global military vehicle market, or to the levels of defence spending in the Groups home markets, particularly in the US, that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Impairment goodwill The total goodwill impairment charge of 725m mainly arises in three of the CGUs, Armor 526m, Products Group, acquired as part of the Armor transaction in 2007 156m, and Detica 34m.
The Armor impairment charge reflects both the non-award of a follow-on contract for production of vehicles under the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles FMTV programme and the subsequent impact on the growth prospects of the business.
The Products Group impairment charge reflects a weaker outlook for the business as spending from customer discretionary budgets has reduced in both domestic and export markets.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 9.5%.
The Detica impairment charge relates to the discontinued financial services element of the business.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 10.0%.
Impairment intangible assets The total intangible assets impairment charge of 248m comprises 240m relating to programme and customer related intangibles, and 8m relating to other intangibles.
The charge impacts the EI&S 8m, Land & Armaments 236m and International 4m operating groups.

As part of the transaction, the Groups shareholding in Fleet Support Limited also increased to 100% 2008 55%.
On the date of the transaction, the Group gained full control of BVT, which was previously jointly controlled with VT. From 1 January 2009 to the date of completion, the Group equity accounted the results of BVT to reflect the Groups 55% interest held.
From the date of completion, the results and net assets of BVT, renamed BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited, have been consolidated in the Groups accounts as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Goodwill of 225m arising on the formation of the BVT joint venture, comprising 177m on the initial formation of the joint venture and 48m reflecting adjustments to the provisional fair values assigned to the net assets acquired, and goodwill associated with the Groups initial 50% shareholding in Fleet Support Limited 28m, has been reclassified to intangible assets note 11 in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 149 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 21.
Retirement benefit obligations Pension plans BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are unfunded or defined contribution plans.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the deficit of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2009.
These plans were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2009.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans are: UK US 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 % % % % % % Inflation rate 3.5 2.9 3.3 3.0 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 3.9 4.3 4.5 5.5 5.8 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.3 3.7 2.2 3.4 2.3 3.3 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 3.5 2.9 3.3 n a n a n a Discount rate 5.7 6.3 5.8 5.9 6.5 6.5 Long-term healthcare cost increases n a n a n a 5.3 5.3 5.4 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid value of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2009, continued to use PA 00 medium cohort tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
In addition, this mortality has been subject to a minimum assumed rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1%.
For its US pension arrangements, the mortality tables used for pensioners and non-pensioners are RP 2000 projected to 2010.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK and US plans range from 19 to 23 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 22 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 9% in 2009 reducing to 5% by 2015 for pre-retirement and 10% in 2009 reducing to 5% for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown below.
The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided in the subsequent information.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The increase in the liabilities due to changes in assumptions is primarily due to a fall in corporate bond yields combined with an increase in the expected inflation rate which have combined to reduce the real discount rates used to calculate the liabilities of the pension plans as at 31 December 2009.
The curtailment gain recognised in the year relates to pension benefit restructuring in the US.
During the year, the Group contributed 225m into Trust for the benefit of the Groups main pension scheme.
The contribution is reported within other investments current 211m after a fair value gain of 2m and cash and cash equivalents 16m in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2009, and the use of these assets is restricted under the terms of the Trust.
However, the Group considers this contribution to be equivalent to the other one-off contributions it makes into the Groups pension schemes and, accordingly, presents below a definition of the pension deficit to include this contribution.

Certain of the Groups equity accounted investments participate in the Groups defined benefit plans as well as Airbus SAS, the Groups share of which was disposed of during the year ended 31 December 2006.
As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and to Airbus SAS based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.

This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

The Group has provided residual value guarantees in respect of certain commercial aircraft sold.
At 31 December 2009, the Groups gross exposure to make future payments in respect of these arrangements was 48m 2008 97m.
The Groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held of 32m 2008 58m and the residual values of the related aircraft of 12m 2008 37m.
Such costs are generally incurred within five years.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
Such costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum but not the timing of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.
Reorganisations continuing operations The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Such costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
Legal, contractual and environmental provisions The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided.
Other provisions There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 155 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 23.

Acquisition of subsidiaries Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2009 The most significant acquisition made by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2009 was of the 45% shareholding in BVT Surface Fleet Limited BVT held by VT Group plc VT.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2009, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments would have been 22.8bn, revenue 21.3bn and loss for the year ended 31 December 2009 58m.
BVT now BAE Systems Surface Ships On 30 October 2009, the BVT joint venture became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group after VT Group plc exercised its option to sell its 45% shareholding in BVT to BAE Systems.
Consideration paid including transaction costs for the remaining 45% interest was 348m.
The now wholly-owned company has been renamed BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited Surface Ships.
The Group previously held a 55% interest in BVT, and accounted for its share of the results and net assets of BVT in accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures.
Total provisional goodwill arising amounted to 584m.
This consists of 225m which arose on the initial formation of the BVT joint venture in the year ended 31 December 2008 and 359m arising on the acquisition of the 45% interest.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2009, Surface Ships contributed revenue and profit after tax of 338m and 34m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Surface Ships is a leading designer, manufacturer and integrator of surface ships and their support vessels.
It delivers complex engineering, integration and through-life support across the lifecycle of a ship.
Bringing Surface Ships into full ownership of BAE Systems further strengthens the Groups global maritime business and is consistent with the strategy to establish a sustainable and profitable through-life business in air, land and sea.
Surface Ships has a solid order book, a clear strategy to transform the UK maritime sector and a commitment to deliver existing and future programmes.
The acquisition of BVT had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Advanced Ceramics Research The Group acquired Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. in the US on 8 June 2009 for a consideration of $14m 9m.
The net assets and goodwill included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet as a result of this acquisition are 1m and 8m, respectively.
Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2008 The Group acquired MTC Technologies, Inc. MTC in the US on 9 June 2008, Tenix Defence in Australia on 27 June 2008 and Detica Group plc Detica on 25 September 2008.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2008, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments would have been 19.0bn, revenue 17.2bn and profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 1.8bn.
MTC On 9 June 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MTC in the US for a cash consideration including transaction costs of $375m 188m.
Goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 131m.
Based in Dayton, Ohio, MTC provides technical and professional services, and equipment integration and modernisation for the US military and intelligence agencies.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, MTC contributed revenue and loss after tax of 98m and 1m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results.
The acquisition of MTC complements the existing US business in the Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group.
It allows for synergies in professional services, aircraft integration centres, and modification and sustainment.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within the Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group supporting the goodwill.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Tenix Defence Tenix Defence Holdings Pty Limited Tenix Defence, a leading Australian defence contractor, comprises four businesses in the Land, Aerospace, Electronic Systems and Marine sector.
On 27 June 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tenix Defence for a cash consideration including transaction costs paid of A$697m 328m, subject to adjustment according to the level of working capital in the business at the acquisition date.
1 In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, Tenix Defence contributed revenue, EBITA and loss after tax of 130m, 12m loss and 39m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results.
Included within the loss after tax of 39m is an amortisation expense on intangible assets of 29m.
The acquisition of Tenix Defence complements the existing Australian business enabling BAE Systems to establish a greater presence in the Australian defence market and in particular to expand into the Australian land and marine sectors.
These opportunities do not translate into separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within Tenix Defence supporting the recognised goodwill.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Detica On 25 September 2008, the Groups offer for the acquisition of Detica for 543m including assumption of net debt became wholly unconditional.
Detica is a specialist business and technology consultancy with expertise in information exploitation, security and resilience, threat intelligence and customer insight.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, Detica contributed revenue and profit after tax of 60m UK 55m and 1m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results.
The acquisition of Detica provides access to UK and US government contracting opportunities in the intelligence, security and resilience market and significant cross-selling opportunities, particularly in our home markets.
The combination of capabilities within Detica and BAE Systems will provide innovative solutions in this growing sector.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within BAE Systems supporting the recognised goodwill.

As a result of these acquisitions, 7m of goodwill was generated in the year ended 31 December 2008.
Certain of the fair values assigned to the net assets at the dates of acquisition were provisional, and in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the Group has adjusted the fair values attributable to these acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2009, resulting in a net increase in goodwill of 5m.
This has not had a material impact on the consolidated accounts and, as such, the Group has not restated the balance sheet as at 31 December 2008.
Financial risk management A discussion of the Groups treasury objectives and policies and the use of financial instruments can be found in the Directors report.
Financial instruments comprise net cash debt note 27 together with other financial assets and other financial liabilities note 17 and other instruments deemed to be financial instruments under IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, including non-current receivables, non-current payables and non-current provisions.
Hedging instruments The notional, or contracted, amounts of derivative financial instruments are shown below, analysed between foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts, classified by year of maturity.

The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.

Financial risk management continued The following table compares the estimated fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities to their carrying values at the balance 1 sheet date.

2 Net carrying amount approximates to estimated fair value as there is no active market.
Fair value hierarchy Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2009.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Assets Available-for-sale investments 211 211 Derivatives used for hedging 197 61 258 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 46 6 52 Debt-related derivative financial instruments 39 39 Total assets 454 106 560 Liabilities Loans and receivables 1,118 1,118 Derivatives used for hedging 68 81 149 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 43 163 206 Debt-related derivative financial instruments 23 23 Total liabilities 111 1,385 1,496 Level 1 includes foreign exchange hedges valued at unadjusted quoted prices at less than two years maturity.
Level 2 includes all other fair value items and foreign exchange hedges greater than two years maturity.
Interest rate risk Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Beyond 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2014 m m m m m m Assets Current Cash and cash equivalents 3,693 Liabilities Non-current Loans 865 865 714 689 619 310 Current Loans and overdrafts 349 168 www.
Financial risk management continued Collateral As shown above, the Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge certain long-term foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2009 totalled 11m 2008 nil.
Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by each line of business as part of the Integrated Business Planning process and as part of the monthly reporting cycle.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that it does not breach borrowing limits or covenants.
Surplus cash held by the operating groups over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the line of business cash forecasts.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 1.455bn 2008 1.5bn.
The 45m commitment in the RCF from Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper Inc. was cancelled during 2009 following an all bank consent process.
The RCF is contracted until 2012, although the available amount for the final year reduces to 1.3bn.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year.
Interest rate risk The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and deposits through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon by utilising derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups current interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2008 25% and a maximum of 75% 2008 75% of debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had 62% 2008 73% of fixed rate debt and 38% 2008 27% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 3.3bn including debt-related derivative financial assets 2008 2.6bn.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2009, the Group had a total of $1.9bn 2008 $1.3bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 4.2 years 2008 2.4 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 6.4 years 2008 7 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 3.4% 2008 5.2%, 3.0% on US dollars and 2.3% on sterling 2008 3.5% on US dollars and 8% on sterling.
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 6.3% 2008 6.8%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 12m 2008 6m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 17m 2008 12m.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial instruments.
However, the Group has policies in place to ensure credit risk is limited by placing concentration limits.
The Group has a credit limit system to manage actively its exposure to treasury counterparties.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2009 of 3,693m 2008 2,624m was invested with 26 2008 14 financial institutions.
The system assigns a maximum exposure based on the counterpartys size, a composite credit rating and credit default swap price.
These limits are regularly monitored and updated.
The Group has material receivables due from the UK and US governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables no one counterparty constitutes more than 5% of the balance 2008 2%.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to credit risk through this process.
Currency risk In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the US dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
To mitigate this risk, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures, unless otherwise approved as an exception by the Treasury Review Management Committee, as well as to manage anticipated economic cash flows over the medium term.
The Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material transactional foreign currency exposures.
The Group is also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement or balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
Hedges are, however, undertaken in respect of investments that are not considered long-term or core to the Group.

The list therefore only includes those subsidiary undertakings which principally affected the Group accounts.
No subsidiary undertakings are excluded from the Group consolidation.
Events after the balance sheet date On 5 February 2010, the Group announced a global settlement with the US Department of Justice and the UKs Serious Fraud Office in respect of investigations announced by these two authorities in 2007 and 2004, respectively.
This is an adjusting event after the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 10, Events after the Reporting Period, and, accordingly, the penalties totalling 278m have been reflected in the Groups accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
On 15 February 2010, the Group announced that it had been informed that the decision by the US Department of Defense not to award a follow-on contract for production of vehicles under the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles FMTV programme to BAE Systems had been confirmed.
This is an adjusting event after the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 10 and, accordingly, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets amounting to 592m relating to the Armor Holdings, Inc. transaction and specifically the FMTV product line have been reflected in the Groups accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
