Notes to the Accounts 1 Segmental information IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources and assess their performance.
After review of the segments identified by the previous standard, IAS 14 Segment Reporting, the Board believe that the current segments still apply under IFRS 8.
The business is organised around differences in products and services.
Where areas of the business have common characteristics, segments have been aggregated appropriately.
The Groups reportable segments and their activities are listed below: The Domestic Division supplies a comprehensive range of bathroom, heating and plumbing products to a variety of customers, both public and private sector, from large national contractors to the sole trading plumber and heating engineer through its extensive branch network.
The Industrial Division is the market leader in the UK supply and distribution of pipeline, process, heating and mechanical services equipment.
Its customers range from large national contractors to local independents.
The Specialist Division supplies a range of power tools, hand tools, maintenance and health and safety products to three principal market sectors, the manufacturing industry, wholesale and trade customers.
The Division uses its key capabilities, industry leading catalogues, web and vendor managed inventory solutions, in order to maximise service to its customers.

4 Pension schemes Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2006 for the main UK and Irish schemes and 31 December 2005 for the secondary UK scheme.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
On 1 April 2008, the main UK scheme became a salary sacrifice scheme with membership being on an opt out basis, whereby the Group contributes into the scheme on behalf of the employees.
On 1 January 2009, the second UK scheme also became a salary sacrifice scheme, again on an opt out basis.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates two defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the scheme administrators.
On 1 January 2009, the UK scheme became a salary sacrifice scheme on an opt out basis, whereby the Group contributes into the scheme on behalf of the employees.
During the year, the Group contributed 1.2m 2008: 0.8m to the defined contribution schemes.
The outstanding contributions as at 31 March 2009 were nil 2008: nil.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Discount rate 6.60 6.40 Expected return on scheme assets 7.08 7.35 Future salary increases 3.85 4.65 Future pension increases 2.85 3.40 Inflation 2.85 3.40 Proportion of employees opting for early retirement Nil Nil 1.95% for next three years reverting to 3.85% after this period.

The cumulative gain recognised in the SORIE is 18.3m 2008: 37.5m.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 152.8 160.9 Current service cost 3.2 2.4 Interest cost 9.7 8.7 Scheme participants contributions 0.3 1.7 Actuarial gain 25.8 18.4 Benefits paid 3.5 3.4 Foreign currency exchange rate changes on foreign scheme 0.9 0.9 Closing defined benefit obligation 137.6 152.8 Changes in the fair value of the scheme assets are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Opening fair value of scheme assets 139.7 142.6 Expected return 10.2 10.8 Actuarial loss 45.0 15.7 Contributions by employer 4.3 2.9 Scheme participants contributions 0.3 1.7 Benefits paid 3.5 3.4 Foreign currency exchange rate changes in foreign schemes 0.7 0.8 Closing fair value of scheme assets 106.7 139.7 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 49 Notes to the Accounts continued 4 Pension schemes continued The fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows: 2009 2009 2008 2008 m % m % Equity securities 93.3 87.4 124.2 88.9 Debt securities 8.2 7.7 9.2 6.6 Property 3.6 3.4 3.8 2.7 Cash and other 1.6 1.5 2.5 1.8 106.7 100.0 139.7 100.0 The actual loss on scheme assets over 2009 was 34.8 m 2008: 4.9 m. The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices published by the London Stock Exchange.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolio.

It will be paid on 24 July 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 26 June 2009.
There are no income tax consequences in respect of the dividends declared, but not recognised in the financial statements.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding those held as Treasury shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 51 Notes to the Accounts continued 8 Earnings per share continued Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2009 2008 | Weighted Weighted average average number Per-share number Per-share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Statutory Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 41.0 123.250 33.3 40.8 122.320 33.3 Effect of dilutive securities: Options 0.370 1.025 Diluted EPS Adjusted earnings 41.0 123.620 33.2 40.8 123.345 33.0 At 31 March 2009 867,302 2008: 439,875 share options had an exercise price in excess of the market value of the shares on that day.
As a result for 2009, these options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

The adjustments are not significant and therefore the prior year balance sheet has not been restated.
Impairment review During the year management has carried out an impairment review for the goodwill carried in the balance sheet.
No impairments were identified as a result of the review.
All of the recoverable amounts were based on value in use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: cash flow projections are based on board approved budgets for the financial year ending 2010 and three year plan for 2010 to 2012 long term growth rates of between 2 and 4% a pre tax discount rate of 4.02% 2008: 6.34% which has been applied to each cash-generating unit as they each have a similar risk profile there are three cash-generating units which are disclosed in the segmental information note The Directors are confident that the assumptions used above are reasonable, although it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the assumptions were amended significantly.

Included within this balance is 6.6m attributed to the BuckHickman InOne brand name Roebuck, and 3.9m attributed to the Birchwood brands, Defender, Scruffs, Van Vault and Rhino, which are considered to have an indefinite life.
The Roebuck brand name has been trading for over a 100 years and therefore it is considered to have an indefinite life and is reviewed annually for impairment.
The Birchwood brand names have been trading for over 20 years and the product lines are consistently updated to meet market demands.
Therefore the brands are considered to have an indefinite life and are reviewed annually for impairment.

No interest is charged on the trade receivables for the first 60 days from the date of the invoice.
Thereafter, the Group reserves the right to charge interest at 2% per annum above the UK clearing bank base lending rate on the outstanding balance until payment is received in full.
Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Before accepting any new customer the Group uses a bespoke credit scoring system, designed in house and tailored specifically for the industry which is backed up by an external Credit Reference Agency, to assess the potential customers credit quality.
The Group reserves the right to set credit limits by customer.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, 7.4 million 2008: 5.6m is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Groups trade receivable balance includes debtors with a carrying amount of 38.4m 2008: 29.4m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The concentration of credit risk is limited as the Groups exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 1.0m 2008: 0.4m which have been placed under liquidation.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.

Of the new borrowing, $75m is repayable in May 2013 with the remaining $50m repayable in May 2016.
In order to protect itself against currency movements and interest rate exposures, the Group entered into three cross currency and three interest rate swaps.
g Fair values For both the Group and the Company the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing rates at 31 March.
There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed with the exception of the US$ loan notes.
Movements in the fair value of the US$ loan notes and the related financial instruments used to hedge against interest and currency risk are disclosed in note 16.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 16. h Guarantees and security No debt is secured, except for that relating to 0.1m 2008: 0.5m of finance lease obligations, which are secured on the assets subject to the leases.
There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts and ancillary banking facilities between the Group companies.
The companies listed below are guarantors of the $125m US Loan notes, 100m revolving credit facility and the interest rate and currency derivatives as at 31 March 2009.
The BSS Group plc PTS Group Limited The British Steam Specialties International Limited resigned as a guarantor on 29 April 2009 Spendlove C. Jebb Holdings Limited Spendlove C. Jebb resigned as a guarantor on 29 April 2009 Following the refinancing of the revolving credit facility on 29 April 2009 additional guarantors were included as listed below: Price Tool Sales Limited Buck & Hickman Limited Central England Supplies Limited Direct Heating Spares Limited A. Warren & Sons Limited AHED Limited Birchwood Products Limited The Group companies have entered into other guarantee and counter-indemnities arrangements in respect of guarantees issued in favour of Group companies by the clearing banks amounting to approximately 8.2m 2008: 8.2m.
i Defaults and breaches The US$ Loan notes and the revolving credit facility both have covenants that are reviewed formally by the Group on a six monthly basis.
There have been no breaches of the covenants.
16 Derivative and non-current financial instruments Significant accounting policies Details of significant accounting policies and methods of valuation adopted by the Group in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Statement of Accounting Policies on page 41.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 19, 21 and 22 respectively.
58 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 16 Derivative and non-current financial instruments continued The Groups senior management team review the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital are considered.
Based upon these reviews the structure of the capital can be altered by payment of dividends, new share issues, share buy-backs or by issuing or repaying debt.
The Group has set limits which are approved by the shareholders for the number of shares that can be allotted within a five year period.
The compliance with this limit is reviewed by the Board prior to any new grant of share options taking place.
The Group also has limits approved by the shareholders for share buy-backs or rights issues.
The Articles of Association limit the amount of borrowings the Group has at any one time to two times the adjusted net assets of the Group.
Through the covenants set out in the RCF agreement and US loan note agreements, the maximum amount of borrowings the Group can have outstanding is limited.
Compliance with the covenants is monitored on a half yearly basis or in conjunction with a change in the business.

Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based upon discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions.
the fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available use is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.

These risks include currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposures where necessary.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups treasury policies developed in conjunction with the Board.
Compliance with the policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis by quarterly reports from the the Treasury function and monthly Credit Committee meetings.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest rate management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and the remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date: Fair value hedges Outstanding floating for fixed contracts Average contracted Notional principal fixed interest rate amount Fair value | | 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m Over 5 years 5.07 6.86 43.1 43.1 0.4 0.3 The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
The interest rate swaps manage the Groups exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US Dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 11 May 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps on the seven year borrowing of 29m and 14m that convert the borrowings on $50m and $25m respectively from 5.8% to a variable rate on six month LIBOR plus a basis point increment of 64.75 and 66.79 respectively.
A further interest rate swap on the ten year borrowing of 29m converts the borrowing on the $50m debt from 5.91% to a fixed rate of 4.7% plus a basis point increment of 70.75.
The interest rate swap contract exchanging fixed rate interest for fixed rate interest is designated and effective as a fair value hedge in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 14.6 m 2008: 0.5m, which was included in profit or loss at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap 14.7m 2008: 0.3 m was included in profit or loss.
Cash flow hedges Outstanding fixed for fixed contracts Average contracted Notional principal fixed interest rate amount Fair value | | 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m 2 5 years 5.40 5.40 29.0 29.0 3.8 2.8 60 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 16 Derivative and non-current financial instruments continued The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a net basis.
At 31 March 2009 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate within two to five years from the balance sheet date, was estimated at 3.8m 2008: 2.8m.
This amount is based upon the market values of equivalent financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof deferred in equity.
Foreign currency risk management In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the private placing of $125m, the Group has entered into three cross currency swaps to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the private placement to 72m as well as fixing the exchange rates applicable to future coupon payments.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US Dollars and Euros.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than twelve months in duration to buy US Dollars and Euros to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$5.5m and 0.4m 2008: US$7.0m and 0.7m.
The average exchange rate of the US Dollar contracts is 1.487 2008: 2.028 and the Euro contracts is 1.115 2008: 1.467.
The fair value of these derivatives are 0.1m and nil respectively 2008: 0.1m and 0.1m respectively.
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
Liquidity risk management The Board has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding requirements.
The Group manages the risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities.
Included in note 15 is a list of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has to further reduce liquidity risk.
The following tables detail the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to senior management and represents the Directors assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If the interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit for the year ended 31 March 2009 would have decreased increased by 1.2m 2008: decreased increased by 0.9m net equity would have decreased increased by 1.2m 2008: decreased increased by 0.9m Other derivatives The BSS Group plc has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
No embedded derivatives existed as at 31 March 2009 2008: nil.

The property dilapidation provision represents the estimated costs of dilapidation repairs which have arisen over the period of the Groups occupation of leasehold property, the liability for which is contained in a tenancy agreement.
Provision is only made where the repair can be legally enforced and it is likely that the obligation will result in an outflow of economic benefit.
These liabilities will crystallise over the period of the lease.
The property dilapidation provision is for properties which have a remaining lease period of up to three years.
The onerous lease provision is for properties with a remaining lease period of between one and eleven years.
The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis of its provisions.

Prior period acquisitions The provisional fair values ascribed to the net assets of acquisitions made during 2007 08 and disclosed in the 2008 financial statements were finalised during the year.
There were no significant changes to the values disclosed last year and therefore the prior year balance sheet has not been restated for these changes.

At the current time both the cost of acquisition and fair value of assets and liabilities are estimates based on information available to the Group at the date of approval of these financial statements.
Further adjustments may be necessary when full information is available.
