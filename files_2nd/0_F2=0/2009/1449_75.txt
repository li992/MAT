The 2009, 2008 and 2007 prior year deferred tax adjustments relate to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the businesses of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if distributed as dividends.
