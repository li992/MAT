Quotient is accounted for as an investment as Helical believes that despite the level of its shareholding it does not have significant influence as it is not represented on the board of Quotient and has no influence over its operational and financial decisions.
The valuation of the investment in Quotient was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market for the shares.
The valuation for one part of the business is based on the sales price of a similar business.
Due to the movement in market conditions and difference in the technology involved the sales price was discounted by 60%.
For the remainder of the business the valuation was derived from the earnings for the year to 31 March 2009 and an earnings multiple for the business based on the sales values of similar businesses within the biosciences sector.
The increase in the valuation of the investment in Quotient has been recognised as a movement in reserves and in the statement of recognised income and expense as has the associated movement in deferred tax.
During the year the Group sold a tenth of its holding in Quotient for 2,100,000 generating a profit on cost of 1,892,000 and 864,000 on carrying value.
It was believed that the correct discount factor should be within the range of 50% to 60%.
The discount factor of 60% was deemed to be the most appropriate discount factor.
However, had the discount factor been 50% the value of the investment would have been 1,455,000 greater and the shareholder funds would have been increased by 1,048,000.
The earnings multiple was calculated from the sales values of other similar businesses.
The multiple chosen was in the middle of the range of multiples identified.
Had the earnings multiple been at the bottom of the range the value of the investment would have been 958,000 lower and the shareholder funds would have been reduced by 690,000.
Had the earnings multiple been at the top of the range the value of the investment would have been 574,000 greater and the shareholder funds would have been increased by 413,000.
Included within current available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed-use development.
On repayment of this loan the Group is entitled to 10% of the equity of the counterparty.
In addition, Helical has two options to purchase additional shares for a pre-determined price, which are held at fair value with any movement being recognised in the Income Statement.
The loan and the right to the equity have been classed as available-for-sale investments and are held at fair value.
The Group has determined its fair value by considering both the loan and the equity element separately.
The loan element has been valued at the fair value of the consideration receivable.
The equity element has been given a nil value with the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at nil as they believe this is the most probable outcome.
The underlying company has been valued at nil as in the event of the break-up of the Company, the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the Companys assets, after the repayment of the loan payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
For this reason the two options have also been valued at nil.
The movement in the value of the available-for-sale investments and the associated deferred tax movement have been recognised as movements in reserves.
