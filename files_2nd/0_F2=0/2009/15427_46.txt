The merger relief reserve is not distributable but can be used to: Make a bonus issue of fully paid shares: Transfer to the retained earnings an amount equal to the amount that has become realised by virtue of either: The disposal of the related investment: or An amount written off the related investment and charged against the retained earnings.
During 2008 1,934.2m was transferred to retained earnings to offset the write down charged to the profit and loss account of the investment to which the reserve related.
Other reserves Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve arose on the historical redemption of parent Company shares, and is not distributable.
Translation reserve Translation reserve consists of exchange differences arising on the translation of overseas operations.
It also includes changes in fair values of hedging derivatives where such instruments are designated and effective as hedges of investment in overseas operations.
Share-based payment tax reserve As explained in the statement of accounting policies, an expense is recorded in the Groups income statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of share options granted to employees.
As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Companys share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, in this share-based payment tax reserve.
Other reserve As detailed in Note 7, the Group issued 57.8m of warrants with a fair value of 5.5m.
The full cost of the warrants was recognised in the Other reserve on their issuance.
