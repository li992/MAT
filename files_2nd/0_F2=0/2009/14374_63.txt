These are updated during December,  that occurredbetween September andDecember.
Goodwill continued During the year, an impairment was made for the goodwill relating to the pain management business , whichisheldforsale.
For each cash generating unit CGU the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in line with the Groups strategic planning process.
The growth rates used over the five year period for the Orthopaedics business vary up to 8% 2008 10%, for the Endoscopy business up to 9% 2008 10% andfortheAdvanced WoundManagement business upto8% 2008 12%.
The calculation of value-in-use for the three identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set outbelow: The discount rate reflects managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Orthopaedics business is 11% 2008 12%, for the Endoscopy businesses it is 12% 2008 12% and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 9% 2008 10%.
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered the annual sales growth and trading margins.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the currentyear.
Specific considerations and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading marginforeachCGU are: Orthopaedics In the Orthopaedic CGU management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on the customer, high quality customer service, and innovative product development, and through .
Endoscopy It is managements intent to maintain and grow this CGU as the leading provider of endoscopic techniques and technologies for joint and ligament repair.
This is driven partly through the growing acceptance of Endoscopy as a preferred surgical choice amongst physicians and patients, productinnovation, , .
Advanced Wound Management Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on the higher added value sectors of exudate and infection management through improved wound bed preparation,  pressure woundtherapy, .
A growth rate of 4% 2008 4% in pre-tax cash flows is assumed after five years in calculating a terminal value for the Groups CGUs.
Management considers this to be an appropriate estimate based on the growth rates ofthemarkets .
Capital expenditure represents the Groups expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment .
Management : Growth of Market and Market Share Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share.
The value-in-use calculation shows that if the assumed long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of all of the CGUs independently would still be greater than theircarryingvalues.
Discount Rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation.
The value-in-use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 31% for the Orthopaedics business, 37% and39%fortheAdvanced WoundManagement business.
