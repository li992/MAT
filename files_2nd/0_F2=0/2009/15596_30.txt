com annualreview09 THE YEAR IN REvIEW 9 International sales up 31% Philip Clarke International and IT Director How do you run successful businesses in so many countries?
Weve long understood that retailing is local.
Each team on the ground is able to adjust our offer to each market because customers in China, for example, arent the same as those in Poland or South Korea.
So weve never tried to run the international business from our office in the UK.
In fact, we have very few expats working outside the UK in South Korea just six out of a team of 20,000 people.
As we face into some strong economic headwinds, its more important than ever to stay close to customers and be able to adapt quickly locally as their needs change.
We have people in each of our markets who have a wealth of experience and are able to make the decisions that really matter.
A big part of my job is about making sure weve got the right people in each country, sharing experience around the business and empowering people to do the right things for their customers.
10 THE YEAR IN REvIEW 540m in productivity savings David Potts Retail and Logistics Director Is Every Little Helps still important?
Making many small improvements in everything we do is what Every Little Helps is about, because when we all work together on the little things, it amounts to a great deal.
Its more important today than its ever been it keeps us focused on what matters most to customers.
They are shopping around more and price is clearly a priority for many so we need to put the right effort and investment into price but not sacrifice all the other things that are important to customers, such as not having to queue and being able to get everything that they want.
So weve continued to make lots of small improvements and theyre making a big difference.
For example, through a number of initiatives to achieve a better and more efficient service at our checkouts, many more customers didnt have to queue last year and customers continue to rank us best for speed of service at the checkouts.
THE YEAR IN REvIEW 11 Core UK Everyone in the business understands the way we work to make things better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for Tesco.
At a time when customers are feeling the pinch and our competitors have improved, this philosophy is more important than ever.

Can I still get the best deals at Tesco?
Across the non-food market, customers have been cutting back on non-essential purchases.
But they have been buying when they see real value and, as a consequence, we have increased our market share as customers appreciate the convenience of buying non-food from Tesco and the value that we offer.
Weve been adding new ranges with lower price-points and extending ranges that consumers see as essentials and weve seen real success on own-brand products such as Technika in electricals and Cherokee and F F in our clothing offer.
Our online catalogue non-food offer, Tesco Direct, has been very popular and we have seen strong growth with our latest spring summer range which included 1,500 price cuts compared to our autumn winter catalogue.
With the benefit of high footfall, great value ranges and the option to shop in store or online, we are well placed to continue to grow both sales and market share in a difficult market.

We believe in creating value for all our customers because that is how we earn their loyalty.
Over time customers have come to trust Tesco to deliver value whether they are buying their weekly shop or opening a savings account.
Their trust is very important to us.
So we take the same approach to financial services as we do to all other parts of our business and that means offering competitive, straightforward products with no confusing small print and hidden charges.
Unlike many of the high street banks TPF is well funded we never got involved in any of the complicated financial products and toxic debt that has caused so many problems for the banking sector.
So while many banks now have to grow their margins and rebuild their balance sheets, we can concentrate on offering competitive rates across our savings, loans, credit cards and insurance products.
Looking further ahead, its clear that customers want us to provide a real alternative to other banks and that means a broader product range, including a current account.

com cr-report09 THE YEAR IN REvIEW 17 250 Community Champions Lucy Neville-Rolfe Corporate & Legal Affairs Director How much do customers really care about community when they are struggling with the recession?
We understand that many of our customers are facing real financial pressures at the moment and theyre looking to us to help them spend less.
However, when customers shop with us they dont leave their ethics at the door and theyre telling us it is still really important to them that we behave responsibly and honestly.
They want to see Tesco doing the right things on community and the environment at the same time as providing them with the value they expect from us.
Weve made some great progress this year and one of the things Im most proud of is the work we have done in getting unemployed people back to work which is especially important in light of rising unemployment in the UK and elsewhere.
Last year we recruited over 3,000 longterm unemployed people and other disadvantaged job seekers, up on nearly 500 the previous year.
18 THE YEAR IN REvIEW 470,000 people Tim Mason President and CEO of Fresh & Easy Is training and developing staff still a priority?
Having started a business from scratch in the US one of the worlds largest markets I know how important it is to have a strong team around you.
Developing talent is crucial to any growing business, particularly retail which is a people-intensive industry.
As a Group, were still investing hard and growing through the downturn, with sales growing by 15% last year.
To handle that growth well, we need to bring skilled, experienced people through all the time to fill the thousands of jobs it creates.
Take Fresh & Easy where our team has grown from 65 to over 2,500 in less than two years.
Hundreds more will join us this year, so we cant rely on bringing people in from other parts of the business.
We need to develop our own talent locally and equip our people with the skills they need to be able to do the job and lead others.
Thats why were absolutely committed to putting the best training plans in place making sure that all of our people have the opportunity to get on in the business.
