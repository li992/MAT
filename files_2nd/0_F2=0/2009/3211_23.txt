These changes will continue across 2010.
In 2009 the number of joint product households taking both an energy and a service product grew by 164,000 to over two million.
This is an important indicator for British Gas and the deeper customer relationship should result in a greater level of retention.
This growth reflects considerably increased levels of cross-selling.
By the end of the year 58,000 customers had chosen our first bundled energy and services proposition EnergyExtra which we launched in September.
The number of customer accounts in our residential energy business grew by 141,000 to 15.7 million.
This growth followed 10% price reductions for gas and electricity, which made us the cheapest supplier of electricity in all regions of Britain.
A further price reduction in February 2010 made us the cheapest major domestic energy supplier in the UK for both gas and electricity.
We also increased the number of services customer relationships by 400,000 to 1 5.7m 8.5 million.

The Rough storage facility demonstrated exceptional operational performance during 2009 with reliability in excess of 98%.
Asset utilisation was very high during early 2009 due to colder than normal weather and supply concerns caused by the dispute between Russia and the Ukraine.
Gross revenue in the period was down 5%, mainly as a result of the non-recurrence of the sale of cushion gas out of the Rough asset, which generated 26 million of revenue in the second half of 2008.
Operating profit was down 14%, predominantly for the same reason.
In January 2010 National Grid issued Gas Balancing Alerts on three days in a week, having only ever issued one previously.
Rough supplied around 10% of UK gas demand on each of these days.
As the UKs dependence on gas imports increases, storage will play an increasing role in maintaining security of supply.

We have also significantly increased the scale and profitability of our business energy division following the acquisition of Strategic Energy, and are the third largest commercial and industrial power supplier in North America.
Residential energy supply Our residential energy business produced a good underlying performance, as a decline in customer numbers in Canada and Texas was broadly offset by an increase in the US North East where we grew our customer base by around 150,000 to over 500,000 as authorities look to open up their markets to competition.
This offers the prospect of further growth for the future.
Profitability reduced in 2009, primarily as a result of a one-off write-off in the first half of 45 million of bad debt in Texas, although better debt management processes did result in an improvement in collection rates in the second half of the year.
The results were also impacted by further one-off items in the second half of the year, totalling 16 million.

Our upstream gas business in Alberta was seriously affected as the achieved sales price fell by 29%.
This low gas price meant that production volumes increased by only 3% despite the full-year impact of the acquisitions of Rockyview and TransGlobe made in the first half of 2008.
We chose to defer development activity, and instead deployed capital to increase our gas reserves through small-scale acquisitions.
As a result, our reserves base increased slightly to 400 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe by the end of 2009, even after accounting for in-year production.
Power generation volumes were up by 6% as the thorough maintenance on our three power plants in Texas, carried out when prices were low in the first half of the year, resulted in increased availability and lower outages.
Centrica plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2009 17 Corporate Responsibility Review Managing our business impact Being a responsible business is Green Streets in numbers: We ran a yearlong project called Green fundamental to our long-term success Streets, a competition between eight affecting our reputation with customers, communities that promoted awareness of low carbon solutions for householders investors, regulators, employees and other stakeholders.
We recognise the impact our business has on society and the environment and aim to contribute to the health and sustainability of both.
That is what we mean 25% by corporate responsibility.
The project showed demonstrable In 2009 we reviewed the focus of our corporate responsibility work.
We obtained benefits for consumers through lower feedback from external stakeholders in the UK and North America and identified energy bills and, most importantly, the following areas where Centrica can have the greatest long-term impact: an average reduction in carbon footprint of almost 25% to contribute to the transition to a low carbon society: to invest in secure energy supplies for our customers: to be trusted by our customers and support the most vulnerable: to keep our employees safe and healthy at work: to develop our employees: to support local communities: and to ensure responsible procurement.
Our contribution to the transition to a low carbon society Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Copenhagen climate change conference in 2009, we firmly believe that man-made climate change is a problem which requires urgent and sustained global action.
Centrica has an important role to play in assisting the transition to a future low carbon society.
We are committed to be the leading supplier of low carbon advice and services from microgeneration to efficient heating installations.
And we are 35mt CO2 committed to targets for reducing the carbon intensity of the energy that we supply.
If the Green Streets savings were British Gas customer communications channels, energy advisory services and replicated across UK households, we installation capabilities are mobilising to support this transition.
We are creating estimate that 35 million tonnes of CO2 a generation of new green jobs, recruiting and training employees to provide low would be cut from the national carbon carbon solutions.
footprint Improving energy efficiency through loft and cavity wall insulation is the cheapest way to reduce energy bills and carbon emissions.
The products we supplied in 2009 will save 17.53 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over their lifetime.
With our network of over 6 billion 9,000 engineers, we are the UKs leading supplier of A-rated high-efficiency boilers.
At 2009 prices this would save 6 billion During 2009 British Gas installed more than 50,000 smart meters in businesses per annum and homes across the UK.
Smart meters allow the energy supplier and customer to monitor energy consumption in real time, thereby raising awareness of energy use and encouraging energy saving.
The UK Government has announced that energy suppliers will be responsible for installing and maintaining smart gas and electricity meters in 26 million properties over the next 10 years a total of 47 million by 2020.
In 2009 the carbon intensity of our UK power generation was 370g CO2 kWh, a reduction of 2% compared to 2008 that reflected the additional wind farm capacity 18 Our society is resolved to reduce levels of carbon in the atmosphere and to secure energy supplies for the future.
Centrica can help achieve these goals and is keenly aware of its responsibilities.
Mary Francis CBE, Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee within our generation portfolio.
The purchase of the stake in British Energy and more planned investment in renewable energy will mean that we can reduce carbon intensity further we expect to cut the carbon intensity of our UK supplied electricity by more than 30% in the next decade.
In 2009 we completed the Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farms and announced a new 270MW wind farm to be built off the coast of Lincolnshire.
We intend for our offices to be a demonstration of what is achievable for our customers.
