Performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counterindemnities in respect of such guarantees relating to the Groups own contracts and or the Groups share of certain contractual obligations of joint ventures and associates.
Where the Group enters into such arrangements, it does so in order to provide assurance to the beneficiary that it will fulfil its existing contractual obligations.

Eurest Support Services On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations UN.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it in relation to this matter in October 2006, but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group co-operated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has, however, not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has co-operated fully with the UN throughout.
Eurest Portugal Sociedade Europeia Restaurantes LDA In February 2007, the Groups Portuguese business, Eurest Portugal Sociedade Europeia Restaurantes LDA, was visited by the Portuguese Competition Authority PCA as part of an investigation into possible past breaches of competition law by the Group and other caterers in the sector.
The PCA investigation relates to a part of the Portuguese catering business which services mainly public sector contracts.
The Group is co-operating fully with the PCA.
The investigation has been ongoing for some while and it is likely that it will take some time to complete.
The outcome cannot be predicted at this point.
Revenues of the Portuguese business for the year ended 30 September 2009 were 135 million 155 million.
Other litigation The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reduce financial risk associated with claims related to these proceedings.
Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential uninsured losses.
Outcome Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group.
Minimum profits guarantee The Group has provided a guarantee to one of its joint venture partners over the level of profits which will accrue to them in future periods.
The maximum amount payable under this guarantee is 35 million, which would be payable in respect of the period from 1 July 2007 to 31 December 2010.
Based on the latest management projections, no overall liability is expected to arise in relation to this guarantee: however, the phasing of profits over the period covered by this guarantee is expected to give rise to a number of annual payments repayments between the parties.
