The dilution gains therefore include a minority interest of US$71 million.
2 Subsequent to the dilution of its interests in Bank of Communications, HSBC increased its holding from 18.60 per cent to 19.01 per cent at 31 December 2007 Note 21.
In 2007, certain HSBC associates issued new shares.
HSBC did not subscribe and, as a result, its interests in the associates equity decreased.
The assets of each associate substantially increased as a result of the new share issue and, as a consequence, HSBCs share of the associates underlying net assets increased notwithstanding the reduction in the Groups proportionate ownership interests.
This increase is a gain arising from the dilution of the Groups interests in the associates, and is presented in the income statement.
