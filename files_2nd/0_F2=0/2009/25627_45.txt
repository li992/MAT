Employee information continued IFRS 2 applies to grants made after 7th November 2002, the issue date of the original exposure draft.
LTIPs awarded to executives of operating subsidiaries have performance conditions relating to the growth in trading profit and profit before tax over a three year period from the date of the award.
In general terms the annual average growth must exceed the regional RPI by a margin of at least 2%.
LTIPs awarded to Executive Directors of the Group in 2003 have performance conditions based on the Company's earnings per share EPS.
For 50% of each award, EPS growth is measured over three years.
Full vesting occurs if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by at least 10% and vesting only starts if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by 2%, with pro rata vesting between 2% and 10%.
If the minimum EPS growth hurdle has not been achieved over the 3 years there is discretion to extend the measurement periods for a further year.
The other 50% of the award vests depending on EPS growth using the same 2% - 10% range over a single year, although shares cannot normally be acquired until after 3 years.
However, if the condition was not satisfied in full, the remaining proportion of the award could vest depending on the performance over the remainder of the three year period.

All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Group's employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
