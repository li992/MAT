166.3 Total Revenue as defined in IAS 18, Revenue 440.6 729.0 2. Business and geographical segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with the effect from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and returns approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
As a result, following the adoption of IFRS 8, the identification of the Groups reportable segments has changed.
As a result the comparative year has have been restated to reflect the revised segmental analysis determined by the Group.
The Groups reportable segments have been determined in accordance with the reorganisation activity finalised since the interim report, focusing on key market sectors as opposed to service product.
Principally, this split the Group into two business areas being: Aerospace, Defence & Energy ADE : and Automotive & General Industrial AGI This initial split is determined following consideration of factors including the different customer sets, differing service requirements and different characteristics of business activity.
A further split is then made for the revised geographical divisional split of the Group being: Western Europe North America: and Emerging Markets Revenue by country 2009 2008 m m USA 123.0 137.0 France 74.9 90.5 UK 52.7 68.3 Germany 50.2 67.3 Others 134.6 188.7 Total Revenue - continuing operations 435.4 551.8 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 67 ID4874 Bc AR2009 14. qxp 5 3 10 16:09 Page 68 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009 2.

Following the adoption of IFRS 8, as disclosed in note 2, the Group has restated the allocation of goodwill, matching the updated cash generating units applicable to the new structure.
After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 m m ADE: Western Europe 27.4 28.8 North America 36.9 55.4 AGI: Western Europe 18.0 21.6 North America 15.2 24.5 Emerging Markets 10.4 10.5 Head Office.
0.8 107.9 141.6 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all cash generating units is 9.5% 2008: 9.4%.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows over a fifteen year period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years.
The expected sales reflect managements expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each cash generating units profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of the restructuring programme, where appropriate.
Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.1% 2008: 3.1%, being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cash generating units carrying value.
A cut in the sales growth rate by seven percentage points would result in the carrying value of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was impaired for heat treatment locations across the Group as a result of the current uncertain market conditions.
The most significant impairments were made in locations in the North American Automotive & General Industrial and North American Aerospace, Defence & Energy divisions.

The average term of finance leases entered into is 7 years.
Unguaranteed residual values of assets leased under finance leases at the balance sheet date are 0.9m 2008: 1.1m.
The interest rate inherent in the leases is fixed at the contract date for the entire lease term.
The average effective interest rate contracted approximates to 4.5% 2008: 4.5%.
The fair value of the Groups finance lease receivables at 31 December 2009 is estimated at 0.9m 2008: 1.1m.
The lease receivables are secured on the related assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk of finance lease receivables for the current and prior period is the carrying amount as the Group has no allowance for doubtful debts.
The finance lease receivables are not past due and are not impaired in the current and prior year.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 8.1m 2008: 8.4m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in the Finance Directors Report on pages 26 to 33.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 16.6m 2008: 30.5m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 10.1m 2008: 10.5m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.

Derivative financial instruments continued The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not material in either 2009 or 2008.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.
In addition, energy derivatives have been used in Sweden to fix forward electricity prices, however this position is expected to unwind in 2010.
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into foreign currency denominated cross currency swaps that were designated as a hedging instrument for the purposes of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
The contracts are entered into either with both currencies at floating interest rates generally based on 3 month LIBOR interest rates or both currencies at fixed interest rates.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2009 2008 m m Deferred tax liabilities 73.4 78.3 Deferred tax assets 56.9 52.5 16.5 25.8 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 177.1m 2008: 115.0m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 83.4m 2008: 42.2m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 93.7m 2008: 72.8m of such losses.
All recognised losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 525.8m 2008: 601.9m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
The deferred tax liabilities not provided at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
Temporary differences at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
