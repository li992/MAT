In preparation for the divestment of the ABN AMRO businesses to be acquired by the Dutch State, on 6 February 2010, the businesses of ABN AMRO acquired by the Dutch State were legally demerged from the RBS acquired businesses.
As a result, there are now two separate banks within ABN AMRO Holding N. V. The Royal Bank of Scotland N. V. and the new entity named ABN AMRO Bank N. V. each licensed separately by the Dutch Central Bank.
Both banks will be governed by the current managing and supervisory boards of ABN AMRO Holding N. V. until the legal separation of the new ABN AMRO Bank N. V. from ABN AMRO Holding N. V. which is expected to take place within two months of the legal demerger and is subject to approval by the Dutch Central Bank.
From that point RBS will cease to consolidate the Consortium Members interest in ABN AMRO in the RBS Group statutory results.
