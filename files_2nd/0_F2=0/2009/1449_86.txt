15 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair-value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 20, debt Note 14 and cash Note 13.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: Managing funding and liquidity risk.
Maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises both a regular cash dividend and subject to business needs, a share re-purchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2009 adopted a progressive dividend policy, whereby the Board intends to maintain or grow the dividend each year, targeting an average dividend cover of 2 times ie a payout ratio of 50%, based on reported earnings, before restructuring costs.
In addition, after providing for business investment, funding the progressive dividend policy and meeting debt service obligations, the Board will regularly assess the opportunity to return cash in excess of these requirements to shareholders through share re-purchases.
The Groups net debt position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has reduced from $7,174m at the beginning of the year to a net funds position of $535m at 31 December 2009 as a result of strong net operating cash in flows.
The Groups policy is to manage its debt level so as to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating.
The Groups current long-term credit rating is A1 by Moodys and AAby Standard and Poors, both with a stable outlook.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 Financial Statements 145 15 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding taking into account forecast cash flow.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $9,918m, fixed deposits of $1,466m less overdrafts of $90m at 31 December 2009, the Group has committed bank facilities of $4.25bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2009, the Group has issued $3,420m under an EMTN programme, and $7,507m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Company regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities consist of $3.6bn maturing in October 2012 and $0.65bn maturing between October and December 2010 and were undrawn at 31 December 2009.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2009, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $2.5bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2014, and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2012 and the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2009.
At 31 December 2009 swaps with a notional value of $1.5bn were designated as fair-value hedges and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair-value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Accounting Policies section from page 128.
The majority of the Groups cash balances are held with third party fund managers with floating rates of interest being earned.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 54% of Group external sales in 2009 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing and research and development costs were denominated in sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally based on forecast cash flows for the currencies of Swedish krona, sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
The 500m January 2010 bond and the 750m November 2010 bond were issued in non-US dollar currencies to match investors appetite but currency swaps were transacted to convert them into fixed-rate US dollar instruments.
As at 31 December 2009, after currency swaps, 5.0% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in sterling and 9.7% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the re-translation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
Transactional The transaction exposures that arise from non-local currency sales and purchases by subsidiaries are, where practicable, fully hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
