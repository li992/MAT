Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
General information Hargreaves Lansdown plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is Kendal House, 4 Brighton Mews, Clifton, Bristol, BS8 2NX, United Kingdom.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Operating and Financial Review.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB together IFRS as endorsed by the European Union.
The Company's financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company.
At the date of the authorisation of the financial statements the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in the financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 1 Revised - Presentation of financial statements IFRS 2 Amendment - Share-based payments IFRS 3 Business combinations IFRS 5 Amendment - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations IFRS 7 Improving disclosures about financial instruments IFRS 8 Operating segments IAS 7 Amendment - Statement of cash flows IAS 16 Amendment - Property, plant and equipment IAS 17 Amendment - Leases IAS 27 Amendment - Consolidated and separate financial statements IAS 32 Amendment - Financial instruments: Presentation IAS 36 Amendment - Impairment of assets IAS 38 Amendment - Intangible assets IAS 39 Amendment - Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement IFRIC 17 Distribution of non cash assets to owners The full impact of these pronouncements is being assessed by the Group.
However, the initial view is that the directors anticipate that the future adoption of those standards, interpretations and amendments listed above will not have a material impact on the Groups results reported within the financial statements other than requiring additional disclosure or alternative presentation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Significant accounting policies Accounting policies as shown below have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 30 June 2009.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group and Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as discussed on pages 19 and 25.
39 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Any gains or losses on sale of the Companys own shares held by the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust EBT are credited directly to the EBT reserve and are treated as undistributable profits.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS on 1 July 2005 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 30 June 1997 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Fund based commissions are recognised on an accruals basis calculated according to the level of assets under the administration, or agency, of the Group.
Initial commissions are deemed to be earned at the policy inception date, except in the case of the Groups stockbroking and unit trust management subsidiary undertakings where all income earned on securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
Where commission is received on an indemnity basis, a provision is made for clawbacks which would be due if the policy lapses during the indemnity period.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates a group self invested personal pension plan for staff.
Payments to the defined contribution retirement benefit scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Bonuses payable to employees The Group recognises a liability and an expense for staff bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Provisions are recognised for future committed property lease payments when the group receives no benefit from the property through continuing usage and future receipts from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the groups future committed payments.
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 40 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Prior to 15 May 2007 the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore, in the absence of a readily available market price for the shares, the share price was based on the market value agreed with HM Revenue & Customs and share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility applying to a comparable group of listed companies.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided, where material, on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment: Leasehold property tenants fixtures over the life of the lease Office equipment over 10 years Computer equipment and software over 3 to 4 years Motor vehicles over 4 years The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
41 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill Other intangible assets comprise computer software which is stated at cost less amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible fixed assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Computer software over 3 to 4 years The carrying values of computer software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Website development design and content development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset, which delivers benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Dividend recognition Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and paid, or if earlier, in the accounting period when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as debtors.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
The Groups available-for-sale investments have been included at fair value where a fair value can be reliably calculated, with the revaluation gains and losses reflected in the investment revaluation reserve, as shown in note 24, until sale when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
If a fair value cannot be reliably calculated by reference to a quoted market price or other method of valuation, available-for-sale investments are included at cost where the directors believe that cost is not materially different to fair value, with a fair value adjustment recognised upon disposal of the investment.
Investments which are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price of the listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement.
An investment is classified in this category if it is held principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 42 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Included within cash balances are amounts held on client settlement accounts as shown in note 18.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value which is equivalent to amortised cost.
In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as creditors.
Key sources of judgements and estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where a higher degree of judgement or complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are discussed below.
Share based payments In determining the fair value of equity settled share based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions about the future events and market conditions.
In particular, judgement must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.
The fair value is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on future estimates, including the Groups future dividend policy, the timing with which the options will be exercised and the future volatility in the price of the Groups shares.
Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could materially affect the reported value of share based payments.
Indemnity provision The indemnity provision represents managements best estimate of the Groups liability to policy lapses resulting in indemnity commission claw-backs.
The calculation is based on the volume of indemnified commission and on past experience of policy cancellation.
Staff costs Included in staff costs is an estimate of the future liability for bonuses and other employee incentive schemes which have been earned but not paid.
Revenue Revenue represents commission receivable from financial services provided to clients, interest on settlement accounts and management fees charged to clients.
It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax.
An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2009 2008 Revenue from services: 000 000 Fees and commission income 99,578 102,277 Interest and similar income 31,142 16,710 Subscriptions and sundry charges 2,125 1,345 Total operating income 132,845 120,332 43 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 5. Business and geographical segments A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Group is currently organised into different operating divisions, however the nature of the services provided, the regulatory environment, the customer base and distribution channels for each division are the same so that for the purposes of IAS 14 Segment Reporting, the consolidated entity operates in one business segment.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of investment administration and advisory services.
As the Group only operates in one business segment, no additional business segmental analysis has been shown.
All business operations are located within the UK and therefore the Group operates in a single geographical segment.
Profit for the year Profit for the year has been arrived at after charging: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2009 2008 000 000 Depreciation of owned plant and equipment 1,350 1,058 Amortisation of other intangible assets 399 171 Operating lease rentals payable - property 968 810 Staff costs see note 7 37,244 36,518 Auditors remuneration The analysis of auditors' remuneration is as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2009 2008 000 000 Audit fees: fees payable for the audit of the Companys annual accounts 5 6 Audit fees: fees payable for the audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 79 78 Audit fees: fees payable for the audit of the Companys half yearly financial report 10 10 Audit fees: other verification work 6- Fees payable to the Companys auditors and their associates for other services to the Group: Tax advisory services 211 Total non-audit fees 211 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 44 Notes to the Financial Statements 7.

All employees are eligible to be considered for an annual discretionary bonus.
In addition to cash bonuses, the Group operates various share based remuneration schemes as described in note 32.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, including ordinary shares held in the EBT reserve which have vested unconditionally with employees.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Underlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share are calculated as for basic and diluted earnings per share, but using an adjusted earnings figure such that the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company is stated before investment gains.
The directors consider that the underlying earnings per share represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.

Goodwill - Group 30 June 30 June 2009 2008 000 000 Cost At beginning and end of year 1,450 1,450 Accumulated impairment losses At beginning and end of year 117 117 Carrying amount At end of year 1,333 1,333 The net carrying value of goodwill relates entirely to the acquisition of Hargreaves Lansdown Pensions Direct Limited.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts covering the period to 30 June 2011 approved by management extrapolated based on an estimated long term industry growth rate of 3%.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to this subsidiary.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.8%.

The weighted average share price during the year ended 30 June 2008 was 190.15p.
Prior to 15 May 2007 the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore no readily available market price existed for the shares.
The share price of share option awards granted prior to 15 May 2007 were based on the latest market value agreed with HM Revenue & Customs using an earnings multiples approach based on comparable quoted companies.
Similarly, share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility experienced by a comparable group of quoted companies.
Since 15 May 2007, a quoted market price has been available for the companys shares.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in note 7.

Financial instruments Fair value The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale financial assets where there is a quoted market price.
Investments in equity instruments which do not have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost which the directors believe is not significantly different to fair value.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments a Financial risk management Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset listed and unlisted investments.
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables.
The main risks arising from financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below.
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis.
Hargreaves Lansdowns financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed company.
The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board.
61 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 35.
Financial instruments continued b Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest bearing assets.
There is an exposure to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2009 the value of financial instruments on the Group balance sheet exposed to interest rate risk was 87,416,000 2008: 68,241,000 comprising cash and cash equivalents.
A 100bps 1% move in interest rates, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
This exposure is continually monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints.
The Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and six months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective fixed term deposit rates.
As a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on cash balances held for clients.
These balances are not on the Group balance sheet.
Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
With substantially all of the Group's businesses located within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not meeting its expected value.
The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group balance sheet.
At 30 June 2009, the fair value of investments recognised on the Group balance sheet was 2,382,000 2008: 1,142,000.
A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to security price risk on investments held for clients.
These assets are not on the Group balance sheet.
The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset class diversification.
The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks, and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails to fulfil its obligations.
The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls.
c Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely, the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
The Group is highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets.
The Group actively maintains cash balances on short term deposit to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.

Within the Groups Stockbroking operation, the Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the period between the trade date and the settlement date.
This period is generally three business days.
The Group has credit exposure that extends beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities.
These transactions are with financial institutions and clients.
Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty.
In that instance, the securities could be sold in the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of delivery versus payment trade debtors.
As a result, the risk exposure is effectively to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and settlement.
Other credit risk within the Group is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the majority represents balances due from other regulated financial institutions where there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and institution.
Credit risk is therefore considered to be limited.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
63 Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements 35.
Financial instruments continued Cash is held with UK banks.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and since November 2008 the banks consist of certain eligible banks under the UK Government Credit Guarantee Scheme.
The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management and selection of banking counterparties, and carries out a regular review of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.
The following table discloses the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets.
At At 30 June 30 June 2009 2008 000 000 Receivables at cost: Cash and cash equivalents 87,416 68,241 Trade and other receivables 75,417 76,602 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 717 401 Available-for-sale financial assets: Financial investments 1,665 741 165,215 145,985 The following table contains an analysis of financial assets that are past due but not impaired at the balance sheet date.
