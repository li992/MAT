The Group has provided an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the Convertible Bonds Bonds issued in 2007 by Dana Petroleum Jersey Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, the details of which are contained in note 21.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds, the Bonds will be convertible into preference shares of the issuer, which will then be immediately exchanged for ordinary shares in the Company as guarantor.
Capital Structure The Groups management remains committed to delivering and enhancing shareholder value, and building upon the progress made during recent years.
The Board continues to believe that this can best be achieved by investing in the existing asset portfolio and through the acquisition of new commercial opportunities as they arise.
In light of the Groups ongoing commitment to an extensive forward work programme and the continuing tight market conditions, the Directors do not recommend payment of a dividend at this time.
This is, however, reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
