noteS to the comPany Financial StatementS For the financial year ended 29 august 2009 1 Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation these Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with uK GaaP using the historical cost convention.
these Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards within the united Kingdom and the companies act 2006. the company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ow statement in accordance with FrS 1 revised 1996 cash Flow Statement.
the cash ows of the company are included in the debenhams Group Financial Statements.
the company is also exempt under the terms of FrS 8 related Party disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the debenhams Group.
the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently during the year, are set out below.
Investments investments are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment Testing assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net realisable value and value in use.
Borrowings all borrowings are stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
issue costs together with finance costs, are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the borrowings.
Finance costs represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Taxation current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates that are in force during the period.
deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
timing differences are differences between the taxable profits and the results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
a deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Dividend Distribution a final dividend distribution to the company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the companys Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company shareholders.
interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Share-Based Payments Where the company has granted options over the company shares to employees of its subsidiaries, a capital contribution has been deemed to be made by the company.
this is then recharged to the subsidiary and is based on the fair value of the options issued spread over the options vesting period.
at each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest.
it recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivatives the derivative instruments used by the company to manage its interest rate risk are interest rate swaps.
derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
the method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
the company designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedges.
derivatives are recognised using trade date accounting.
96 Section 4 Financial Statements and notes Debenhams annual report and accounts 2009 1 Accounting Policies continued the company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
the company also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ows of hedged items.
i Cash Flow Hedges the effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the profit and loss account which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
amounts accumulated in equity are recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance Sheet or in the profit and loss account.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is immediately recognised in the relevant line of the profit and loss account which will be affected by the original underlying hedged item.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the relevant line of the profit and loss account which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii Derivatives that do not Qualify for Hedge Accounting certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
the company has taken advantage of the exemption in FrS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and Presentation not to present information on financial risk management and hedging where that information is presented in the same Group Financial Statements.
accordingly, information on risk management and hedging may be found in notes 3 and 22 of the Group Financial Statements.
