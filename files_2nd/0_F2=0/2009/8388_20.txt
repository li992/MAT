2007 CEO Special Award Special Award Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007 08 base salary.
The Special Award is subject to a three-year performance period.
50% of vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: the performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance.

For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile.
