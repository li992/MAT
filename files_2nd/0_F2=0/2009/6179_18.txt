The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these accounts.
Earnings loss per share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit loss for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share in 2009, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees under a SAYE share option scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP schemes.
In 2009, the options granted under the SAYE Scheme were non-dilutive as the option price exceeded the average share price for the year.
No dilution was applied in 2008 as the amount attributable to shareholders was a loss.
Underlying earnings are as defined in the Glossary.
Underlying earnings per share divides underlying earnings attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.
The underlying earnings per share for 2008 has been restated as a result of the decision to exclude the amortisation charge of 0.5m after tax from underlying earnings.
The impact of this restatement has been to reduce underlying earnings per share from 58.7p to 57.6p.
Reconciliations of the earnings loss and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted Loss Average Earnings Average Earnings Number of per Loss Number of per Earnings Shares Share Earnings Shares Share Continuing operations m 000 Pence m 000 Pence Profit loss attributable to equity holders of the Company 26.5 49.0 Total shares issued 45,646 45,646 Shares held by ESOP Trust 96 190 Basic EPS 26.5 45,550 58.2 49.0 45,456 107.8 Effect of dilutive securities share options 439 Diluted EPS 26.5 45,989 57.6 49.0 45,456 107.8 Share of profit attributable to equity holders of the Company before exceptional items and revaluations 25.6 26.2 Underlying EPS 2008 restated 25.6 45,550 56.2 26.2 45,456 57.6 Report and Accounts Notes on the Accounts continued 13.

The valuation was arrived at by reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
The valuations have been incorporated into the accounts at 31st December 2009 with the resulting increase in fair value of 10.4m being taken to the Income Statement and the increase of 9.6m to reserves in relation to the transfer of property from operational land and buildings to investment property during the year.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of investment property.
The Groups investment properties excluding OTL were valued at 31st December 2008 by Bidwells, as Independent Valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS and the International Valuation Standards IVS1.
The valuation of each investment property was on the basis of Market Value, subject to the assumption that the investment properties would be sold subject to any existing leases.
The Market Value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Forth Ports Annual Report and Accounts 2009 83 Bidwells has assumed that each Port will continue to be operational and has made the special assumption that all investment properties are free from contamination and that any spillages or contamination will be removed by the tenant prior to the termination of the lease.
In accordance with the Valuation Standards, Bidwells confirms that, although it has carried out the valuation of the assets since 1991, it has not provided other property advice.
In relation to the firms preceding year the total fees paid by the Company as a percentage of the firms total fee income was less than 5%.
Bidwells maintains a policy of rotating valuers in accordance with Practice Statement 5.2.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nordic Group is considered to have an indefinite life in accordance with IFRS 3 revised.
Customer relationships recognised on the acquisition of the Nordic Group are written off on a straight-line basis over a period of up to fifteen years.
Amortisation of customer relationships of 0.8m 2008 0.7m is included in the cost of sales line in the Income Statement.
Amortisation of software of 0.0m 2008 0.0m is charged to cost of sales and 0.6m 2008 0.7m to administrative expenses.
Goodwill of 26.4m and 1.5m has been allocated for impairment purposes to individual cash generating units CGUs, being two of the trading divisions of the Nordic Group Nordic Recycling Limited NRL and Nordic Data Management Limited NDM respectively.
The allocation was based on managements expectation of future economic benefits from those CGUs, and is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.
As part of the annual impairment review of the Nordic goodwill, account was taken of the performance in 2009.
On the basis of the Nordic management teams financial projections which contain both lower commodity prices and volumes going forward, the Group has recognised an impairment in NRLs goodwill of 12.3m in 2009.
The recoverable amount has been determined on a value in use basis.
The calculations are based on five year pre-tax cash flow projections approved by management.
Cash flows beyond the initial five year period are extrapolated using the growth rate below.
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are as follows: Assumption How Determined Revenue Estimated revenue has been based on management projections taking into account experience and minimum contracted revenue.
Operating margin Estimated operating margin has been based on management projections taking into account experience and changes in cost base following acquisition by the Group.
This includes operating costs and maintenance capital expenditure.
Growth rate The growth rates in the first five years for all the CGUs range from 2.25% to 19.25%.

The employers are not entitled to participate in any surplus arising in the FRDW scheme.
The contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.0m 2008 0.0m.
The Company and Port of Dundee Limited PODL are the Competent Harbour Authorities in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay respectively where they are responsible for the provision of pilotage services.
The pilotage acts are provided by self-employed pilots.
The Company and PODL have no liability arising under the PNPF Scheme on an ongoing basis, however, they may have a liability for certain members if the PNPF is wound up.
Neither Company is aware of any such intention to wind up the Scheme.
Both the Company and PODL have been notified by the Trustee of the PNPF Scheme that it has issued proceedings in the High Court in order to seek directions from the Court as to its liability under both the Rules of the Scheme and in law to make up the Schemes deficit.
The hearing has concluded but the Judge is still to give his Opinion.
As this case is extremely complex, it is not possible to state with certainty what the outcome is likely to be and, therefore, what financial effect, if any, there may be on PODL and the Company.
The employer contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme operated by the Nordic Group of companies during the year was 0.1m 2008 0.1m.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio and an allowance made for expected expenses.
This gave an assumed rate of 6.22% net of expenses at 31st December 2009.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31st December 2009 was 22.2m 2008 18.4 m.

Acquisition of remaining share capital in Ocean Terminal Limited On 17th December 2009, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the issued share capital of Ocean Terminal Limited that it did not already own, thereby obtaining control of Ocean Terminal Limited.
Ocean Terminal Limited is a property investment company which operates the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre in Leith.
The acquisition gives the Group control of the development site around the centre, known as The Harbour, and increases the income base of the property business.
The total acquisition accounting adjustment gain taken to the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of the acquisition is 7.6m.
This comprises a fair value uplift in the previous joint venture holding of 4.6m, and a further 3.0m of negative goodwill arising on acquisition.
The negative goodwill arising on the acquisition arises as a result of there being an excess of net assets acquired over the consideration paid.
The negative goodwill is not taxable.
Fair value of previously held equity interest m Carrying value prior to acquisition 0.3 Fair value adjustment released to Consolidated Income Statement 4.6 4.3 Forth Ports Annual Report and Accounts 2009 107 The fair value adjustment reflects the difference between the consolidated historical cost of the joint venture, and the 50% share of the fair value of Ocean Terminal Limited prior to acquisition.
There are no intangibles to recognise related to customer relationships as these are reflected through the investment property valuation.
The debt facilities were renegotiated on 13th March 2009 and there are no significant credit spread movements to be reflected in arriving at the fair value on acquisition.
Therefore the net book value of Ocean Terminal Limited is deemed to be equivalent to the fair value.
Bank of Scotland, our joint venture partner in Ocean Terminal Limited, was acquired by Lloyds Banking Group LBG in 2009.
LBG carried out a review of the Bank of Scotland equity holdings and decided to dispose of a number of these investments.
As part of this divestment programme, LBG concluded an agreement with Forth Ports to sell its shares in Ocean Terminal Limited in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders Agreement.

Ocean Terminal Limited did not contribute any revenue or profit to the Groups profit for the period from the date of acquisition to the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisition of Ocean Terminal Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues would have been 181.3m and Group profit after exceptional items and revaluations would have been 35.3m, an increase of 7.4m and a decrease of 1.0m respectively.
40. Dividend On 22nd March 2010, the Board agreed to propose a final dividend of 19.1p for the year ended 31st December 2009.
A resolution to this effect will be put to the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders on 30th April 2010.
