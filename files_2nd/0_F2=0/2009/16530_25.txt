The model has been based on the most recent cash flow forecasts prepared by management, which consist of detailed product-by-product analyses based on individual forecasts for development timings, royalty and growth rates.
The discount rates used in the forecasts range from 13% to 16%.

Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 65 Notes to the financial statements continued at 31 March 2009 22 Financial instruments continued Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of Vectura Group plc, comprising issued share capital note 23a, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Externally imposed capital requirement The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant Accounting Policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.
Financial risk management The Groups objective in using financial instruments is to maximise the returns on funds held on deposit, to minimise exchange rate risk where appropriate, and to generate additional cash resources through the issue of shares when appropriate.
Balance sheets at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008 are not necessarily representative of the positions throughout the year, as cash and short-term investments fluctuate considerably depending on when share issues have occurred.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The Group is funded principally with equity and invests its funds in short-term bank deposits.
The Group has access to the majority of these deposits at a maximum of 24 hours notice.
The Groups policy throughout the period has been to minimise the risk by placing funds in low-risk cash deposits, but also to maximise the return on funds placed on deposit.
Interest on overnight cash deposits is calculated on the basis of a floating rate set at between 5 and 10 basis points below seven-day sterling London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups principal functional currency is sterling.
However, the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to offset its currency exposure by matching foreign currency revenues with expenditure in the same foreign currency.
Where there are no imminent foreign exchange transactions, the balances are exchanged for sterling at spot rate.
As the timing and amount of US dollar denominated income is uncertain, it is not possible to estimate the impact of a change in the foreign exchange rates on the Group.

Cash and cash equivalents earned 3.6m of finance income during the year 2008: 4.5m.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 March 2009 would increase decrease by 0.5m 2008: 0.4m.
All the Groups monetary assets and liabilities are held at floating rates.
Liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Credit risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributed to its cash and cash equivalents.
The Board operates an investment policy, under which the primary objective is to invest in a diverse portfolio of low risk cash or cash equivalent investments to safeguard the principal.
The Groups credit risk on trade and other receivables is low as the amounts are owed by large, multinational, pharmaceutical companies.
For the same reason, the directors assess the quality of these assets as high.
Market risk management The Groups exposure to market risk primarily comprises interest rate exposure.
Group funds are invested in cash deposits with the objective of maintaining a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.

Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 68 24 Equity-settled share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive Plan The Companys Directors, officers and employees hold options under the Vectura Unapproved Share Option Plan the Unapproved Plan, under Enterprise Management Incentive arrangements the EMI Plan and under the Vectura Approved Share Option Plan.
Options are granted to acquire shares at the opening market price ruling on the date of grant.
In general, options vest after three years and are exercisable during a period ending ten years after the date of grant.
On 18 January 2007, upon the acquisition of Innovata plc in accordance with a scheme of arrangement, options over Innovata shares issued and outstanding at that date under the ML Laboratories plc 1989 Executive Option Scheme and the ML Laboratories plc 1999 Executive Option Scheme were exchanged for options over Vectura shares in accordance with the rules of the relevant Innovata Option Scheme.
The exchange was on the basis that the option holders received new options representing 0.2858 Vectura shares for every one Innovata share.
The Company operates a Sharesave Scheme.
All employees and Executive Directors are invited to subscribe for options to acquire shares in the Company, which may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value on the offer date.
The options granted vest after three years and are exercisable during a period of six months following the vesting date.
The Company also operates an LTIP under which Executive Directors and certain senior managers are granted conditional rights in the form of nil-cost options to receive a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three-year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period, depending on the extent to which the challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation was made, are satisfied.
The nil-cost option entitlement is exercisable from the beginning of the fourth year to the end of the tenth year following the date of grant.
Further information on the performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Report on remuneration.
At 31 March 2009, Executive Directors and eligible senior managers hold rights to 949,776 ordinary shares that vested on 12 September 2008, and further rights that may result in the issue of 668,814 ordinary shares on 22 November 2009, 329,670 ordinary shares on 2 March 2010, 842,269 ordinary shares on 25 May 2010 and 1,630,705 ordinary shares on 23 May 2011.
On 31 October 2008, the shareholders approved the VRP.
The VRP runs in parallel to the LTIP and provides participants with a share of a pre-determined percentage of the total consideration paid for the Company in the event of a change in control.
In this event, under the VRP members of the Executive Committee of the Company will be granted a one-off entitlement in the form of units, which convert into ordinary shares in the Company, the actual number of shares that convert being linked to the offer price per share achieved.
The VRP is triggered upon achievement of a minimum bid price of 1.27 per share, with a maximum number of shares available to participants if the bid price reaches 1.77 per share, or greater.
Fair value calculations The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 and has applied IFRS 2 only to options granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005.
At 31 March 2009, there were 3,579,113 options outstanding that were granted before this date 2008: 3,968,221.
With the exception of the LTIP awards and the potential awards under the VRP, the fair value of the options was determined using the Black Scholes pricing model.
The fair value of the LTIP and VRP awards have been estimated using the Monte Carlo model, using the same basis for the assumptions for volatility, option life, expected dividend yield and risk-free rate of return as used for the BlackScholes model.
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the LTIP, it was considered equally probable that the Companys performance would be such that it would perform in each of the quartiles established under the LTIP scheme, as described in the Report on remuneration.
Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 69 Notes to the financial statements continued at 31 March 2009 24 Equity-settled share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive Plan continued Year of grant The assumptions input into the BlackScholes model were as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price of grants during the year 51.89p 68.31p Weighted average exercise price of grants during the year 49.18p 53.33p 1 Expected volatility 3337% 3348% Expected life 5 years 5 years Expected dividends Nil Nil 2 Risk-free interest rate 1.95.4% 3.95.6% The assumptions input into the Monte Carlo model were as follows: Weighted average share price of grants during the year 43.98p 88.65p Weighted average exercise price of grants during the year 0.025p 0.025p 1 Expected volatility 34% 48% Expected life 3 years 3 years Expected dividends Nil Nil 2 Risk-free interest rate 5.0% 5.7% 1 Expected volatility has been calculated by reference to the Companys historic share price since the IPO in July 2004, considered alongside the volatility of similar companies.
The expectation of the cancellation of options has been considered in determining the fair value expense charged in the income statement.
2 The risk-free interest rate is the UK Gilt Rate at the date of grant, commensurate with the expected term.
The charge is spread over the expected vesting period, utilising the fair value calculated by using the two models above, and after adjusting for the likelihood of cancellation of options when employees leave.
The share-based compensation charge for the year ended 31 March 2009, including the LTIP, is 1,898,000 2008: 2,702,000.
The aggregate of the estimated fair value of options granted under share option schemes and Share Incentive Plan during the year ended 31 March 2009 was 585,000 2008: 576,000 and under the SAYE Scheme 64,000 2008: 226,000.
The estimated fair value of the LTIP awards and under the VRP during the year ended 31 March 2009 was 1,096,000 2008: 510,000.
