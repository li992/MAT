Taxation continued b Reconciliation of the total tax charge continued The standard UK rate of corporation tax was reduced to 28% from 1 April 2008.
On the basis that the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities were not expected to materially crystallise before 1 April 2008 the Groups deferred tax balances were recognised at 28% at 30 December 2007.
In April 2008 legislation was introduced to withdraw industrial buildings allowances.
This has the effect of preventing the Group from fully relieving the cost of the commissary buildings against its trading pro ts chargeable to corporation tax.
For the purpose of IAS 12 this will reduce the tax base of the commissary buildings without having a corresponding impact on their accounts base.
The initial recognition exemption is not available in these circumstances.
The recognition of the resulting deferred tax liability has led to an increase in the effective tax rate of 2.09 percentage points from 27.19% to 29.28% for the period ended 28 December 2008.
The deferred tax liability is expected to reverse over the period that the commissary buildings are recovered.

There are no income tax consequences for the Group attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.
