The undiscounted cash flows of these financial instruments are not materially different from their carrying values.
In addition, there were non-interest-earning financial liabilities comprising trade and other payables of 216.4m 2008: 276.3m which were payable within one year.
The Group had unutilised committed banking facilities of 88.4m at 31 December 2009 2008: 77.4m.

Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Derivatives The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
In 2009 and in 2008, the valuation methods of all of the Groups derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as Level 2.
Level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Trade and other payables and receivables and construction work in progress For payables and receivables with a remaining life of one year or less, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other payables and receivables are discounted to determine their fair value.

Details of the terms and conditions of the current share option plans are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 39.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to options granted before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
Under the 2001 Plans, the option price is the average of the share price for the three days preceding the date of grant.
Under the Performance Share Plan, all awards have an exercise price of 1 per exercise.
Options outstanding are as follows: 2001 Plans Weighted average Performance 2001 Plans exercise Share Plan Options price Options Outstanding at 1 January 2008 228,500 247.0p 892,342 Granted during 2008 271,574 Forfeited during 2008 7,500 238.0p Exercised during 2008 14,000 248.2p 320,500 Outstanding at 31 December 2008 and 1 January 2009 207,000 247.2p 843,416 Granted during 2009 388,527 Exercised during 2009 150,000 248.4p 346,250 Outstanding at 31 December 2009 57,000 244.2p 885,693 Exercisable at 1 January 2008 228,500 247.0p 21,250 Exercisable at 31 December 2008 and 1 January 2009 207,000 247.2p 21,250 Exercisable at 31 December 2009 57,000 244.2p 8,750 Exercises occurred throughout the year.
The average share price during the year was 627.6p.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a stochastic model.
The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model, with expectations of early exercise being incorporated into the model.
The inputs into the stochastic model are as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 523.0p 696.0p Weighted average exercise price 0.0p 0.0p Expected volatility 47.1% 38.2% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 1.63% 3.95% Expected dividend yield 3.96% 2.59% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous six years, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The Group recognised total expenses included in operating costs of 0.5m 2008: 1.3m related to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions.
