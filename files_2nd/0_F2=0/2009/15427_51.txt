For share plans with non-market conditions granted during the current and preceding year, the fair value of the awards at grant date was determined using the Binomial model.
The inputs into that model were as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 0.39 0.38 Weighted average exercise price 0.39 0.69 Expected volatility 57% 37% Expected life 3 5 years 3 5 years Risk free rate 3.1% 4.4% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.5% The weighted average fair value of share awards granted during the year is 21p 2008: 10p.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the expected term.
