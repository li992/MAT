Review of the year Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 1.
Group accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The financial information has also been prepared under the historical cost convention except that it has been modified to include certain financial assets and liabilities including derivatives at their fair value through the profit and loss.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 were approved by the Board of directors on 24 March 2010.
Functional and presentational currency The financial information has been presented in Euros, which is the presentational currency.
The Euro has been selected as the Groups presentational currency as this is the currency used in its significant contracts.
The functional currency of the parent company is Sterling.
use of estimates and judgements overview The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and contingent liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions mainly relate to the useful life of noncurrent assets, the discounted cash flows used in impairment testing and the establishing of provisions for litigation, pensions and other benefits, taxes, inventory valuations and guarantees.
Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual values may vary from the estimates.
The estimates and the assumptions are under continuous review with particular attention paid to the life of material plant.
Critical accounting and valuation policies and methods are those that are both most important to the depiction of the Groups financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and that require the application of subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
The critical accounting policies that we disclose will not necessarily result in material changes to our financial statements in any given period but rather contain a potential for material change.
The main accounting and valuation policies used by the Group are outlined in the following notes.
While not all of the significant accounting policies require subjective or complex judgements, the Group considers that the following accounting policies should be considered critical accounting policies.
use of estimates property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are based on estimates of the period during which the assets will generate revenue.
The carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are subject to regular impairment testing and are reviewed annually and upon indication of impairment.
A full impairment review has been carried out on all the assets of PV Crystalox Solar Silicon GmbH and no adjustment was necessary see next section.
Although we believe that our estimates of the relevant expected useful lives, our assumptions concerning the business environment and developments in our industry and our estimations of the discounted future cash flows, are appropriate, changes in assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis.
This could lead to additional impairment charges or allowances in the future or to valuation write backs should the expected trends reverse.
Seventy of the Groups ingot production systems in use, with a historical cost of 13 million, are fully depreciated.
use of estimates Bitterfeld plant Discounted cash flows were prepared to assess whether there was a requirement for impairment of the carrying value of the Bitterfeld plant at the year ended 31 December 2009.
The work carried out showed that the discounted cash flows generated are in excess of the investment cost of the plant therefore no impairment is required.
A number of assumptions were made in the preparation of the discounted cash flows.
The primary input factors comprise sales price, production cost, expected life of the plant and the discount factor.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 PV Crystalox Solar PLC 39 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 1.
Group accounting policies continued use of estimates Bitterfeld plant continued Nature of key input assumptions The sales price has been established as the average rate the Group can achieve for longterm feedstock supply based upon current feedstock contracts.
The sales price is agreed as part of supply agreement up to 2014.
The longer term price will therefore depend on the continued prices the Group can secure for feedstock.
The longterm production cost worked into the model is based upon normalised production costs per management expectation.
The uncertainties over the production cost will be resolved as the plant reaches full capacity and costs stabilise.
Since the year end the actual production cost per kg is approximately 20% lower than originally budgeted.
The expected life of the plant is based upon managements expectations and industry averages.
Any uncertainty over the life of the plant will be resolved over time.
The discount factor is dependent on a number of inputs.
These inputs include the market risk premium, the risk free rate and the longterm beta value for the Group.
These inputs are obtained by management from acknowledged market and industry specialists.
The inherent nature of these inputs is that they are estimations and hence there is always a level of uncertainty surrounding the values.
Changes in inputs from the prior year The sales price remains unchanged as it is supported by a longterm sales contract.
The production cost has decreased as a direct result of increased efficiencies at the plant, with unit cost of production 20% ahead of budget in early 2010.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the key assumptions detailed above has been considered.
A 1% change in either sales price or production costs would change the net present value of the discounted cash flows by approximately 2.5 million.
Either a 0.1% change in the discount factor, or if the expected life of the plant were changed by one year, would change the net present value of the discounted cash flows by approximately 1.0 million.
The sensitivities discussed above do not result in a negative net present value.
use of estimates deferred taxes To compute provisions for taxes, estimates have to be applied.
These estimates involve assessing the probability that deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised to offset taxable income.
use of estimates pension costs The defined benefit plans are partly unfunded and partly funded through pension insurance contracts.
Statistical and actuarial methods are used to anticipate future events in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to the plans.
These calculations include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future pension increases.
Statistical information such as withdrawal and mortality rates is also used in estimating the expenses and liabilities under the plans.
Due to changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising from these plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of these actuarial assumptions.
use of estimates provisions Provisions includes solely amounts recognised for warranties.
The cost is estimated based on managements past experience.
use of estimates share-based payments The fair value of shares and share options granted was calculated using a standard methodology, called the BlackScholes model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including volatility of share price.
Details of the inputs and how they were derived are included at note 28.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2009.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
The results of any subsidiary sold or acquired are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income up to, or from, the date control passes.
Unrealised gains and losses on intra group transactions are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Consolidation is conducted by eliminating the investment in the subsidiary with the parents share of the net equity of the subsidiary.
40 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Review of the year Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements 1.
Group accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued The Group owns 100% of the voting rights in PV Crystalox Solar Kabushiki Kaisha.
Minority interests in equity of 43,400 are related to nonredeemable preferred stock, subject to a guaranteed annual dividend payment of 2,000.
As the fair value of the resulting dividend liabilities reduces the equity portion to marginal amounts, all minority interest has been reclassified as liabilities.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiarys separable, identifiable assets and liabilities existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair value reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
So far no acquisitions have taken place since inception of the Group.
Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated upon consolidation.
On 5 January 2007, PV Crystalox Solar PLC became the legal parent company of PV Crystalox Solar AG and its subsidiary companies in a share for share transaction.
The former PV Crystalox Solar AG shareholders became the shareholders of PV Crystalox Solar PLC.
Following the transaction the Groups continuing operations and executive management were those of PV Crystalox Solar AG.
Accordingly, the substance of the combination was that PV Crystalox Solar AG acquired PV Crystalox Solar PLC in a reverse acquisition.
Going concern The directors are confident, having reviewed management accounts, forecasts and customer contracts and after making appropriate enquiries at the time of approving the financial statements, that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, and accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the accounts.
Effects of new accounting pronouncements Accounting standards in effect or applied for the first time in 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments is mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and supersedes the current standard, IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
IFRS 8 was adopted by the Group early in 2007.
The adoption of IAS 1 Revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements does not affect the financial position or profits of the Group, but gives rise to additional disclosures.
The measurement and recognition of the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses is unchanged, however some items that were recognised directly in equity are now recognised in other comprehensive income, namely the exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations.
IAS 1 Revised 2007 affects the presentation of owner changes in equity and the income statement which is now incorporated in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Statement of Changes in Equity has been adapted to disclose the owner changes in equity.
The income statement has been expanded to show the comprehensive income for the year.
In issue, but not yet effective The following interpretations are in issue, but not yet effective.
The Group does not believe that any will have a material impact on the Groups financial positions, results of operations or cash flows.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements has been revised to extend the application of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to investments in subsidiaries which are classified as held for sale in the parents separate financial statements.
The revised standard has to be applied to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of Noncash Assets to Owners effective 1 July 2009.
This interpretation provides guidance on the treatment of distributions of assets other than cash to its shareholders as dividends.

Group accounting policies continued Capital structure As at 31 December 2009 2008 2007 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents see note 10 100,404 96,820 147,892 Loans payable see note 19 30,254 15,703 39,626 Equity see Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 260,160 244,653 191,475 330,310 325,770 299,741 We define capital as equity plus cash less debt as above and our financial strategy in the medium term is to manage a level of debt that balances the risks of the business with optimising the return on equity by the use of gearing.
The Group is currently cash positive following our IPO in June 2007, although these funds will be mainly utilised for capital investment and in the expansion of our existing business.
The only significant borrowings in the Group are in Japan and we take advantage of the relatively low Japanese Yen interest rate to finance our business in Japan.
These borrowings have attached covenants and are secured against our Japanese Yen receivables book.
The terms of the covenants have been and will continue to be adhered to.
The Japanese receivables book and our ongoing sales in Japanese Yen will continue to generate a strong forward cash inflow and accordingly we are not carrying exchange rate risk in respect of these borrowings.
The weighted average rate of interest in 2009 was 1.0% 2008: 1.1%, our gearing ratio was 12% 2008: 6% and debt to capital ratio was 9% 2008: 5%.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are capitalised at cost and amortised over their useful life.
Amortisation of intangible assets is recorded under Depreciation on fixed and intangible assets in the profit or loss.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised at the costs that were necessary to purchase the licences and make the software usable.
The capitalised costs are written down using the straightline method over the expected economic life of the patents five years or software three to five years.
Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the profit or loss as an expense when incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Technical and other uncertainties generally have the effect that such criteria are not met.
However, expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of services and materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Otherwise, development expenditure is recognised in the profit or loss as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets relating to products in development both internally and externally acquired are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the profit or loss.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefit of the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as it occurs.
Only patents have been capitalised as development costs to date, as the future utilisation of other developments is not sufficiently determinable or certain.
42 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Review of the year Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements 1.
Group accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition or construction cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
No depreciation is charged during the period of construction.
The cost of own work capitalised is comprised of direct costs of material and manufacturing and directly attributable costs of manufacturing overheads.
All allowable costs up until the point at which the asset is physically able to operate as intended by management are capitalised.
The capitalised costs are written down using the straightline method.
The Groups policy is to write off the difference between the cost of property, plant and equipment and its residual value systematically over its estimated useful life.
Reviews of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets are made annually, taking commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear into account.
The total useful lives range from approximately 25 to 33 years for buildings, five to ten years for plant and equipment, up to 15 years for fixtures and fittings and three to four years for motor vehicles.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date or upon existence of indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the profit or loss.
Impairment The carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs of disposal, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.
Leased assets Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit or loss on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives are spread over the total period of the lease.
The obligations from lease contracts are disclosed among financial obligations.
For the reporting period, no assets were recorded under finance leases.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of transaction costs if changes in value are not charged directly to the profit or loss.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: Amortised cost fixed deposits, generally funds held with banks and shortterm borrowings and overdrafts are classified as receivables and loans and held at amortised cost: longterm loans are held at amortised cost: and accounts payable are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and thereafter at amortised cost under the effective interest method.
Held for trading derivatives, if any, comprising interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, are classified as held for trading.
They are included at fair value, upon the valuation of the local bank.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 PV Crystalox Solar PLC 43 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 1.
Group accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Loans and receivables noninterest bearing accounts receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost, less provisions for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the profit or loss: and cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of less than three months together with other shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Interest and other income resulting from financial assets are recognised in the profit or loss when receivable, regardless of how the related carrying amount of the financial assets is measured.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Acquisition costs for raw materials are usually determined by the weighted average method.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost of production includes directly attributable costs for material and manufacturing and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses including depreciation based on normal levels of activity.
Selling expenses and other overhead expenses are excluded.
Interest expenses are expensed as incurred and therefore not included.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Income taxes Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year, including any under or over provisions from prior years.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences.
Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
Public grants and subsidies As the German operations are located in a region designated for economic development, the Group receives both investment subsidies and investment grants.
Government grants and subsidies relating to capital expenditure are credited to the Deferred income account and are released to the profit or loss by equal annual instalments over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets under Other income.
Government grants of a revenue nature, mainly for research and development purposes, are credited to the profit or loss in the same period as the related expenditure.
All required conditions of these grants have been and will continue to be met.
Provisions Provisions are formed where a third party obligation exists, which will lead to a probable future outflow of resources and where this outflow can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
Accruals Accruals are recognised when an obligation to meet an outflow of economic benefit in future arises at the balance sheet date.
Accruals are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
44 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Review of the year Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements 1.
Group accounting policies continued Contingent liabilities Provisions are made for legal disputes where there is an obligation at the balance sheet date, an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably.
Where no obligation is present at the balance sheet date no provision is made, although the contingent liability will be disclosed in a note.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
Ownership is considered to have transferred once the silicon products have been received by the customer unless shipping terms dictate any different.
Revenues exclude intragroup sales and value added taxes and represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and settlement discounts.
The net invoice value is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied.
The Group has outsourced some elements of production to external companies.
In cases in which the Group retains power of disposal over the product or product element, a sale is only recognised under IFRS when the final product is sold.
The final product is deemed to have been sold when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in Euros, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Euros at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euros at the average foreign exchange rates of the year that the transactions occurred in.
Transactions of the included entities in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the respective entity at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Euros at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange rate differences arising on transactions are recognised in the profit or loss.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair value are translated to Euros at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
Exchange gains and losses on shortterm foreign currency borrowings and deposits are shown as such and taken to EBIT.
In the consolidated financial statements exchange rate differences arising on consolidation of the net investments in subsidiaries together with those on relevant foreign currency loans are taken directly to the Currency translation adjustment in equity.
The financial information has been presented in Euros, which is the presentational currency.
Interest income and expenses Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested and dividend income and gains.
Interest income is recognised in the profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Employee benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit pension plan A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds at the balance sheet date with a ten year maturity, adjusted for additional term to maturity of the related pension liability.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 PV Crystalox Solar PLC 45 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 1.
Group accounting policies continued Defined benefit pension plan continued Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional to the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Defined contribution plan For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to pension insurance plans on a contractual basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Employee benefit trust accounting policy All assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust EBT have been consolidated in these financial statements as the Group has fide facto control over the trusts net assets as the parent of its sponsoring company.
Deferred revenue As is common practice with the sector, the Group, where appropriate, both seeks to receive deposits from customers in advance of shipment and makes deposits in advance of supplies.
These deposits are held on the balance sheet and matched against revenue cost as appropriate.
Deposits received from customers are not discounted, as the effect is not considered to be material.
See also note 26. other long-term assets As is common practice with the sector, the Group is required to make deposits in advance for the supply of silicon tetrachloride and polysilicon feedstock.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Sharebased Payments.
The Group issues equitysettled sharebased payments to certain employees.
These are measured at their fair value at the date of the grant and are expensed over the vesting period, based, where necessary, on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, and adjusted for any market based conditions.
Grants of shares made during 2008 and 2007 are not subject to performance criteria and were valued at the date of the grant at market value.
During 2009 the Group granted share options to employees.
The share options granted are subject to performance criteria required for the option to vest and are considered in the method of measuring fair value.
Fair value is measured using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
Charges made to the profit or loss in respect of sharebased payments are credited to the sharebased payment reserve.
Shareholders equity Shareholders equity is comprised of the following balances: Share capital is comprised of 416,725,335 ordinary shares of 2 pence each, see note 28.
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of share issue.
Investment in own shares is the Groups shares held by the EBT that are held in Trust for the benefit of employees.
Sharebased payment reserve is the amount charged to the profit or loss account in respect of shares already granted or options outstanding relative to the vesting date or option exercise date.
Reverse acquisition reserve is the difference between the value of the assets acquired and the consideration paid by way of a share for share exchange on 5 January 2007.
Retained earnings is the cumulative profit retained by the Group.
Currency translation adjustment represents the differences arising from the currency translation of the net assets in subsidiaries.

The contracts have durations of up to ten years.
In some cases there are options to extend the rental period.
Selling expenses mainly include delivery costs and warranty provisions.
Technical consulting and research and development costs relate to the expenditure in connection with silicon wafers and ingots.
In addition to those disclosed above, the Group undertakes considerable research and development in the field of continuous production process optimisation and improvement and adaptation of products to market requirements.
These costs are an integral part of a highly technical production process.
The directors have estimated on the basis of directly attributable costs and a general proportion of production costs that the cost of research and development is approximately 8,423,000 for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: 6,150,000.

Pension benefit obligation The obligation relates to fixed post retirement payments for two employees and includes benefits for surviving spouses granted in 2005.
The plan will be fully funded upon retirement of the employees by insurance contracts held and paid in by the Group.
In case of insolvency the benefits have been ceded to the employees directly.
Therefore the fair value of the insurance contracts has been treated as a plan asset.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional to the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
The Group contributions are paid directly to the asset holding insurance company, thereby guaranteeing the value of the scheme which is deemed wholly funded.

The ordinary shares have full voting rights.
Share-based payment plans The Group established the PV Crystalox Solar PLC EBT on 18 January 2007, which has acquired, and may in the future acquire, the Companys ordinary shares for the benefit of the Groups employees.
After the year end the Group was advised that the Trustee of the EBT had completed the purchase of 5,000,000 of the Companys ordinary shares of 2 pence see note 35 for further details giving a total holding of 12,087,000 ordinary shares.
The Group currently has two share option schemes in operation which are satisfied by grants from the EBT.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC Long-term Incentive Plan LtIP This is a longterm incentive scheme under which awards are made to employees consisting of the right to acquire ordinary shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of specified performance conditions at the end of the vesting period which is not less than three years from the date of grant.
Under the LTIP it is possible for awards to be granted which are designated as a Performance Share Award, a Market Value Option or a Nil Cost Option.
To date Performance Share Awards and Market Value Options have been granted.
Performance Share Award PSA A PSA is a conditional award of a specified number of ordinary shares which may be acquired for nil consideration.
The PSAs granted to date have all been initial awards where there is no specified performance condition.
The vesting period of each award is three years from the date of grant and the award must be exercised no later than 42 months following the date of grant.
On 17 December 2007 awards over 2,175,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence were granted to key employees.
On 26 February 2008 awards were granted to employees of 500 shares each over a total of 33,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence.
In 2008 two employees that had been granted an aggregate amount of 150,000 shares of 2 pence each on 17 December 2007 left the Group and in accordance with the rules of the LTIP these grants were cancelled and the shares remain available within the EBT.
Market Value option MVo A MVO is an option with an exercise price per share equal to the market value of a share on the date of grant.
The vesting period of each award is three years from the date of grant and the award must be exercised no later than ten years following the date of grant.
On 24 November 2008 a MVO over 200,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence each was granted to a senior employee and this option is exercisable from 24 November 2011 at 1.00 per share subject to an agreed performance criteria.
In the year under review the following awards were made: on 26 March 2009 a MVO over 200,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence each was granted to a senior employee and this option is exercisable from 26 March 2012 at 76 pence per share subject to an agreed performance criteria: and on 25 September 2009 MVO awards over 1,200,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence each were granted to key senior employee and these options are exercisable from 25 September 2012 at 76.9 pence per share subject to agreed performance criteria.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an employee share scheme approved by HM Revenue and Customs in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 8 to the Finance Act 2000.
On 26 February 2008 awards were granted to UK employees of 500 shares each over a total of 37,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence.
These 37,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence each were transferred from the EBT into the SIP.

Currently the yield on UK Government bonds is 4.67% and the Group has used 5.0%.
The expected volatility rate has been estimated by reference to the Bloomberg calculated twelve month volatility for the Electronic and Electrical Equipment Index.
Risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risks, interest rate risks, procurement risks and exchange rate fluctuation risks.
The Board reviews and determines policies for managing each of these risks and are, as such, summarised below.
These policies have been consistently applied throughout the period.
Credit risk The main credit risk arises from accounts receivable.
All trade receivables are of a shortterm nature, with maximum payment terms of 150 days.
In order to manage credit risk, local management defines limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and customer reputation.
Credit limits are reviewed by local management on a regular basis.
As a supplier to some of the leading manufacturers of solar cells, the Group has a limited number of customers.
In 2009 35.1% of the sales are related to the largest customer 2008: 36.8%.
The number of customers accounting for approximately 95% of the annual revenue decreased from ten in 2008 to eight in 2009.
Where appropriate, the Group requests payment or part payment in advance of shipment, which generally covers the cost of the goods.
Different forms of retention of title are used for security depending on local restrictions prevalent on the respective markets.
The maximum credit risk to the Group is the total of accounts receivable, details of which can be seen in note 11.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 PV Crystalox Solar PLC 59 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 30.
Risk management continued Exchange rate fluctuation risks A large portion of sales revenue is invoiced in foreign currencies, potentially exposing the Group to exchange rate risks.
In the financial year 2009, about 133.7 million 2008: 154.6 million of the Groups sales was generated in Japanese Yen.
Expenses of 89.0 million 2008: 92.9 million invoiced in Japanese Yen were allocated to cost of materials.
Significant cash funds are denominated in currencies other than the presentational currency of the Group.
Excess cash funds not needed for local sourcing are exposed to exchange rate and associated interest fluctuation risks, particularly so in the United Kingdom.
The exchange rate risk is based on assets held in currencies other than Euros.
The Group sells its products in a number of currencies mainly Japanese Yen and Euros and to a lesser extent US Dollars and also purchases in a number of currencies mainly Japanese Yen, Euros, Sterling and US Dollars.
The following exchange rates were used to translate individual companies financial information into the Groups presentational currency: Average Year end rate rate Euro: Japanese Yen 130.404 132.213 Sterling: Euro 1.123 1.111 hedging strategy The Group is largely naturally hedged at an operating level because it buys a significant proportion of its raw materials in Japanese Yen and Euros, operates its wafering factory within the Euro zone and pays for the subcontracting of wafer production in Japan in Japanese Yen.
However, the ingot manufacturing operation is within the United Kingdom and therefore a part of Group costs are in Sterling.
In addition, the Group has a large debtor book in Japan denominated in Japanese Yen and this is subjected to exchange rate fluctuation of that currency.
The Group has increased its Japanese Yen borrowings to hedge against downwards movement in the Japanese Yen Euro exchange rate.
This process continues to be under review.
After careful consideration and due to the satisfactory natural operating hedging position coupled with its policy of matching borrowings in Japanese Yen with Japanese Yen assets, the directors have adopted a longterm policy of setting off any downside risks of currency fluctuation against the associated upside risks.
During 2009 the Japanese Yen Euro exchange rate decreased 3.8% 2008: increased 23.0%.
The impact of this increase on the profit or loss was to decrease sales revenues by approximately 2% 2008: increase 16% and to decrease operating profit EBIT by approximately 1% 2008: increase 6%.
For each 1% movement in the Japanese Yen Euro exchange rate profits would increase decrease by approximately 408,000 2008: 620,000.
The effect of the movement in the Japanese Yen Euro exchange rate on assets held in Japanese Yen has been considered, although Group management has increased borrowings in Japanese Yen so that these largely offset asset balances held in that currency.
Therefore, based on Japanese Yen asset balances on 31 December 2009, each 1% movement in the Japanese Yen Euro exchange rate would have a negligible affect on the currency translation adjustment.
During 2009 the net loss on foreign currency adjustments was a loss of 8.3 million 2008: gain of 36.3 million.
This loss was largely related to differences between the rate at which sales were booked and the rate on the date that the related currency was received.
The remainder of the currency loss related to the conversion of currency balances in respect of Group loans, currency debtor creditor balances and currency advance payments to feedstock suppliers.
These can be broken down into the following broad categories: 2009 2008 million million Revaluation of cash balances 2.7 16.9 Revaluation of Group loans 1.3 11.3 Revaluation of Group raw material deposits 1.9 Debtor creditor revaluation 2.8 0.4 Revaluation of customer suppliers deposits 0.4 7.7 total currency loss gain 8.3 36.3 In line with the Groups natural hedging, upon translation of net assets in the consolidation, there was a positive impact in 2009 of 9.5 million recording as a currency translation adjustment.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks, since the Groups loan agreements largely are subject to variable interest rates.
In the past, in Japan swaps have been used to a small extent to hedge against these risks, although these have now been eliminated.
All variable interest rate loans are of a shortterm nature with a maturity of less than twelve months.
A longer term credit line expired in September 2009.
The vast majority of borrowings 30.3 million almost 100% at the end of 2009 are in Japanese Yen 2008: 99.96%.
Accordingly, there is a downside risk that Japanese Yen interest rates may increase substantially from the current relatively low levels.
However, the Group has a regular strong Japanese Yen income sufficient to repay the loans if Group management wished to do so within a twelve month time scale.

Risk management continued Interest rate risk continued On 31 December 2009 the Group had borrowings in Japanese Yen of 30.3 million 2008: 15.7 million at an average interest rate of approximately 0.964% 2008: 1.135%.
For each 1% rise in the Japanese Yen interest rates Group interest costs would increase by approximately 303,000 2008: 157,000 and for each 1% fall in the Japanese Yen interest rates interest costs would fall by approximately 303,000 2008: 157,000.
Accordingly, Group profits and equity would fall or rise after corporation tax in Japan by approximately 151,000 2008: 80,000.
Further sensitivity analysis of the accruals and loans outstanding at the year end has not been disclosed as these are virtually all current and paid in line with standard payment terms.
The Groups borrowings in Japanese Yen are also current and have no set repayment plan being secured on the Japanese receivables book.
The interest on this loan is paid monthly in arrears.
