Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan SMEIP The Group formerly operated the SMEIP as a discretionary plan for executive Directors and senior managers.
At least half of the participants annual bonus was applied to purchase shares in the Company to be held in an Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
A matching award over shares in the Company was made to the participant, with vesting at the end of the three year deferral period dependent upon the achievement of targets based on the total shareholder return TSR of the Company compared to a peer group of other investment trusts, and for senior managers but not Executive Directors individual performance targets.
Following approval of the new Long Term Incentive Plan in May 2007, no further awards will be made under the SMEIP.
However awards previously made remain subject to the rules of the SMEIP.
As part of the merger arrangements with The Second Alliance Trust PLC, participants in the 2005 SMEIP for that company were offered replacement matching awards in Alliance Trust PLC which were subject to the same terms and conditions as the awards that they replaced.
Further details can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report Pages 42 to 51.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by the Companys shareholders at its Annual General Meeting on 24 May 2007 and replaces the SMEIP.
Like the SMEIP, it is a discretionary plan for executive Directors and senior managers.
The LTIP comprises two elements: first it provides for the grant of matching awards based on the proportion of annual bonus applied by participants in the purchase of shares in the Company and held by the EBT: and secondly it provides for the grant of performance awards.
Both awards, granted over shares in the Company, vest either in full or in part at the end of the three year performance period subject to the TSR meeting pre-defined targets.
In the year to 31 January 2009 participating employees applied a proportion of their annual cash bonuses for the year ended 31 January 2008 to purchase 197,247 103,711 Company shares at a price of 3.42 3.78 per share.
Matching awards of up to 376,672 197,928 shares, and performance awards of up to 958,560 1,015,637 were granted.
Matching awards and performance awards made during the year were valued at 444,232 266,807 and 1,048,086 1,233,659 respectively.
The fair value of the awards granted during the period was calculated using a binomial methodology.

The cumulative charge to the income statement during the year for the cost of the SMEIP and LTIP awards referred to above was 388,801 613,748 for the Company and 741,975 885,242 for the Group.
