0.7 million relates to the remaining property lease obligations in respect of the facilities vacated and this amount will be incurred over the remainder of the lease terms.
Leasehold dilapidations 0.2 million relates to dilapidation costs relating to the closed production facility at Coventry and 0.4 million relates to dilapidations and site clearance of a freehold and a leasehold taken on with the Darcy acquisition in 2007.
Redundancy termination The outstanding balance relates to the redundancy programmes in the UK and Western Continental Europe divisions made in the year to 30 June 2009.
Other The other provisions relate primarily to training cost obligations in France.
For those provisions that have been discounted, the effect of unwinding the provision is not material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
Within the UK, it operates the Robert McBride Pension Fund the Scheme, which is a final salary pension scheme, and also defined contribution schemes.
Together these schemes cover most of the Groups UK employees.
In addition, the Group operates a number of smaller pension and other post-employment schemes in Western Continental Europe that are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The fair value of the Groups non-UK liabilities has been estimated to be 2.2 million 2008: 2.1m.

The Schemes assets are held in external funds administered by trustees and managed professionally.
Regular assessments are carried out by independent actuaries and the long-term contribution rates decided on the basis of their recommendations.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent actuary for the trustee of the Scheme and was carried out as at 31 March 2006.
The results of that valuation have been projected to 30 June 2009 and then updated based on the assumptions disclosed below.
Following the valuation, the Groups ordinary contributions rates increased with effect from the beginning of 2007 by between 0% and 10% of pensionable salaries across the various payrolls within the UK.
In addition, the Group is currently making additional monthly contributions over and above the ordinary contributions.
The Group agreed with the trustees that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by 2018 and that the Group will monitor funding levels on an annual basis.
The next triennial valuation as at 31 March 2009 is currently in progress and is expected to be finalised in early 2010, which will include determining the contribution rates.
The expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected returns on each major category of asset at the balance sheet date.
Bond returns are taken to be equal to the relevant gross redemption yields available.
For equities and property, more judgement is required and it has been assumed that those assets will achieve a return of 3.5% above the gross redemption yield on long-term fixed interest government bonds.
A deduction is made for the expected level of the Schemes expenses.
Weighted average assumptions at the end of the period 2009 2008 Discount rate 6.5% 6.5% Expected return on plan assets 6.6% 8.1% Future salary increases 3.0% 3.9% Inflation rate 3.3% 3.9% Future pension increases 3.3% 3.7% Expected rate of return on plan assets 2009 2008 Equities 7.6% 8.7% Bonds 5.2% 5.9% Property 7.1% 8.2% Cash 4.1% 5.0% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
Mortality rates used are based upon: Life expectancy at age 65 years Mortality table Male Female Future pensioners PMA92 and PFA92 projected to 2030 20.5 23.4 Current pensioners PMA92 and PFA92 projected to 2017 19.6 22.5 Sensitivity analysis for the principal assumptions used to measure the Schemes liabilities shows how the measurement of the Schemes liabilities would have been affected by changes in the relevant assumption at the balance sheet date.
For the purposes of this disclosure all other assumptions are taken to be held constant.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Schemes liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on liabilities % Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease 9.4 Rate of inflation, salary growth and LPI limited price indexation Increase by 0.5% Increase 9.4 Rate of salary growth Increase by 0.5% Increase 2.8 Rate of mortality Change in mortality table Increase 1.4 If the death rates used are 112% for males and 118% for females of the 2000 series standard tables, by year of birth, rather than the PA92 tables projected to 2030 for non-pensioners and 2017 for pensioners.
These alternative projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members.
