Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 000 2009 2008 Full SIPP business 9,074 9,074 Private equity asset management business 297 297 9,371 9,371 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 5% 5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 15.0% 12.5%.
This has been raised due to increased economic uncertainty for both CGUs.
In current market conditions the management have this year budgeted for a lower increase in the revenue anticipated from the Full SIPP Business CGU.
Consequently the projected future cash flows are not sufficient to justify carrying forward any goodwill value and this has been reflected in the recognition of an impairment loss of 9,074,000.
This is included in the capital column of administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
