These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions.
Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Groups products product lives are often measured in decades, these typically forecast the next ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent forecast are based are discount rates, growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 12.75 per cent 2008 12.75 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are: Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation, these are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent 2008 2.5 per cent.
The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
For example, the overall level of business would need to reduce by more that 30 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Vinters plc volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation, these are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at four per cent.
For example, it would require a doubling of the discount rate to cause an impairment of this balance.
Other intangible assets Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and recoverable engine costs have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis: The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 11 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
No impairment is required on this basis.
However, a combination of changes in assumptions and adverse movements in variables that are outside the Groups control discount rate, exchange rate and airframe delays, could result in impairment in future years.
