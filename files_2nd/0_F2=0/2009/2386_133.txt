energy needs Looking ahead Recent economic conditions have weakened global demand for primary energy, but a number of forecasts predict a return to growth in the medium term.
Under the International Energy Agencys IEA Reference Scenario, global energy demand is projected to increase a by around 40% between 2007 and 2030.
