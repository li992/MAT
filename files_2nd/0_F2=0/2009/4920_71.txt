The expected volatility re ects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the reversionary interests were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, and non-market conditions have not been included in calculating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of each reversionary interest granted during the year was 36.0p 2008: 34.0p.
