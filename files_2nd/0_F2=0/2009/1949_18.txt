5 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
A full review of inventories has been performed and land write-downs have been made where cost exceeds net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and overheads.
Estimated selling prices have been reviewed on a site-by-site basis and selling prices have been reduced based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
Following this review a material write-down in both size see below, and nature, given the economic conditions in the UK, has taken place.
These site reviews have resulted in land write downs totalling 58.881 million 2008 112.534 million.
In addition, option costs and related fees have been written down by 6.338 million 2008 15.395 million to their net realisable value.
The Board has also reassessed the net realisable value of part exchange properties and has written down stock by 1.093 million 2008 2.976 million.
The above has resulted in an exceptional charge totalling 66.312 million 2008 130.905 million.

8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Earnings Weighted Earnings Earnings Weighted Earnings loss average number loss per 2008 average number per share 2009 of ordinary share of ordinary 2008 shares 2009 shares 2009 2008 1 Pre-exceptional item 000 no.

A formal internal valuation of investment properties was carried out at the end of the financial year, updating the formal external valuation performed at the end of the previous financial year.
The fair value of investment properties was assessed at 7.983 million 2008 9.038 million.
Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Bellway p. l. c. 57 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 10 Investment property continued As noted above, the Group assessed the residual values as being highly likely to exceed cost and, in the event that costs exceed residual values, any excess would be viewed as not likely to be material in the Groups financial statements.

The carrying value of the land used for security is 57.354 million 2008 36.831 million 17 Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash and preference shares.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through retained earnings, bank borrowings and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of employee share options.
On 6 August 2009 the Group announced the successful placing of 5,747,648 new ordinary shares of 12.5p each representing approximately 5.0% of the Groups issued ordinary share capital prior to the Placing note 27.
The net proceeds from the placing of 43.659 million will help provide the Group with the financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive opportunities to acquire land as and when they arise.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 14.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held see note 16.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
Bellway p. l. c. 62 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Accounts continued 17 Financial risk management continued The Groups banking arrangements outlined below are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on either LIBOR or to the Bank of England base rate.
For the year ended 31 July 2009 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by 1.8 million 2008 2.2 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value being the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Balance at Total contracted Within one year or 12 25 More than 31 July cash payment on demand years years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2009 109,967 113,474 85,341 21,230 6,752 151 At 31 July 2008 133,112 139,916 83,279 42,306 7,125 7,206 The maturity profile of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance at Total contracted Within one year or 12 25 More than 31 July cash payment on demand years years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans floating rates 80,000 84,521 1,030 1,030 62,262 20,199 Preference shares 20,000 29,500 1,900 1,900 25,700 Trade and other payables 69,776 69,776 69,776 At 31 July 2009 169,776 183,797 72,706 2,930 87,962 20,199 Bank loans floating rates 325,000 334,151 59,151 235,000 40,000 Bank loan fixed rates 2,000 2,134 2,134 Preference shares 20,000 31,400 31,400 Trade and other payables 115,404 115,404 115,404 At 31 July 2008 462,404 483,089 176,689 235,000 71,400 The interest rates on the fixed rate borrowing and preference shares apply to the whole term of the relevant instruments.
No interest rate has been calculated for the imputed interest on land payables as this is an accounting transaction with no actual interest payment being made by the Group.
At the year end, the Group had 290.0 million 2008 294.3 million of undrawn bank facilities available.
The Companys only financial liabilities are preference shares as disclosed in the maturity profile above.

IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP and the annual bonus scheme have been made to executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under the scheme.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the above Schemes is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 37 and 40 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Bellway p. l. c. 71 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 24 Employee benefits continued Share-based payments continued For awards made prior to 16 January 2008, vesting of awards under the LTIP is dependent upon total shareholder return of the Group measured against relevant comparator companies as detailed on pages 37 and 40 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
For awards made on 16 January 2008, vesting of awards is dependent upon two conditions, total shareholder return and return on capital employed.
For awards made on 4 November 2008, vesting of awards is dependent only on total shareholder return as detailed on pages 37 and 40 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
With regard to the annual bonus scheme, for awards up to and including those for the year ended 31 July 2006, one half was payable in November each year following the announcement of the Groups annual results.
The other half was used to acquire Bellway shares at the prevailing market value.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
In addition, various small share awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level.
These awards mainly had three-year vesting periods.
Awards to executive directors and to the Group Company Secretary in relation to the year ended 31 July 2007, and subsequent years, are made in cash with no compulsory deferral element.
Share options have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

Valuation methodology For the LTIP, a Monte Carlo simulation method is used which allows the Group's performance, in terms of total shareholder return, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities are calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, is also used.
In the case of the deferred element of the annual bonus, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
Volatility levels for more recent years were considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed.
