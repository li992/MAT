Capital management Our policy has always been to be well capitalised and soundly financed whilst nonetheless maximising our return on capital.
Our approach to capital management is driven by strategy and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate.
We believe our strong capital position is a core strength in the current market environment and leaves us well positioned to take advantage of organic and acquisition growth opportunities.
We also seek to maintain a prudent balance between the advantages and flexibility afforded by a strong capital position and the higher returns on equity that are possible with greater leverage.
In addition to maintaining our strong capital base to support the development of the business it is also important to ensure we meet regulatory capital requirements at all times, as well as maintaining an adequate level of capital in our rated subsidiary, Close Brothers Limited, as determined by rating targets.
We would therefore expect to have capital adequacy ratios in excess of minimum regulatory requirements even before taking account of the need to fund our non regulated activities and small acquisitions.
The board considers both the overall group and each divisions capital position and requirements on a regular basis and after taking into account each divisions regulatory and operational requirements, excess capital is transferred to group every six months by way of dividend.
The Financial Services Authority FSA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition a number of subsidiaries are directly regulated by the FSA.
We completed our transition to Basel II during the financial year ended 31 July 2008 and as reported there was no major impact on our regulatory capital requirement from the transition.
The aim of Basel II is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
Our Pillar 1 information is presented in the table on the next page.
Under Pillar 2, we have completed a self assessment of risks not captured by Pillar 1 in a process known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.
This has been reviewed by the FSA and the process culminated in the FSA providing Individual Capital Guidance on the level of capital we are required to hold.
Pillar 3 aims to encourage market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on a firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on our website.
Total regulatory capital under Basel II increased by 38.0 million during the year to 651.6 million.
This increase arose due to profits for the year of 71.7 million, an increase in exchange movements reserve of 16.3 million and reduction of the intangible assets deduction relating to goodwill of 26.8 million, including goodwill on sale of the Corporate Finance division.
This increase was offset by payment of dividends of 55.2 million and 17.8 million investment in our own shares to hedge share-based award schemes.
Notional risk weighted assets increased by 132.8 million to 3,936.8 million, principally as a result of growth in the loan book, partly offset by a reduction in operational risk as a result of the sale of the Corporate Finance division.
Capital management continued The groups individual entities and the group as a whole complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2009 and 2008.
