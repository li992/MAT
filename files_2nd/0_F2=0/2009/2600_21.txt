notes continued 13 Risk management and financial instruments Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group monitors the return on average capital employed as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the return on average capital employed was 54.7% 2008: 57.3%, the level of total shareholders equity at 31 December 2009 was 674.1m 2008: 629.2m and the amount of dividends paid in the year ended 31 December 2009 was 62.3m 2008: 59.9m.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation, which helps fund future development and growth.
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the executive directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: b a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates: or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2.
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms and regression analysis.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety of sources.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants is monitored and during 2009 all covenants have been complied with.
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups banks and US dollar and sterling bonds.
At 31 December 2009, the total bonds outstanding were 532.7m 2008: 420.7m with maturities ranging from 2011 to 2019.
The bank facilities mature between December 2010 and August 2013.
At 31 December 2009 the available bank facilities totalled 780.6m of which 239.5m was drawn down.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Expiring within one year 160.0 Expiring after one year but within two years 134.7 97.6 Expiring after two years 246.4 144.5 541.1 242.1 In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
The contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out below.
The amounts disclosed below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December in the case of floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Derivative assets and liabilities totalling 25.2m 2008: 44.4m have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.
Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
At 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 there were no loans secured by either fixed or floating charges on the Groups assets.

Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2009 notes 27 notes continued 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued All financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value in the table above have carrying amounts where the fair value component is a level two fair value measurement.
Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The US dollar bonds, included within financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value, have a carrying amount of 210.6m 2008: 420.7m which includes a fair value measurement related to the risk being hedged.
The table above also discloses the fair value of these bonds including all other components of 204.9m 2008: 368.2m.
Fair value gains and losses on interest rate caps and the time value of interest rate collars impact the income statement immediately while all other financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value are in hedging relationships.
Interest rate risk The Group is funded by a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt.
In addition, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to manage the interest rate risk profile.
At 31 December 2009, fixed rate debt of 322.1m 2008: nil related to fixed US dollar and sterling bonds stated at amortised cost with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2019.
At 31 December 2009 floating rate debt comprised 251.3m of floating rate bank loans 2008: 547.7m and 210.6m of fixed rate US dollar bonds which have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps 2008: 420.7m.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps reprice every three and six months.
These interest rate swaps are in fair value hedge relationships with the market risk of the US dollar bonds.
These hedges were effective during the year and have therefore had no net impact on the income statement.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate caps and interest rate collars.
Borrowings with a notional principal of 309.7m were capped at 31 December 2009 2008: 517.6m and borrowings with a notional principal of 186.3m were collared at 31 December 2009 2008: 69.4m.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to the intrinsic value of the interest rate collars.
This hedge was effective during the year with a loss of 1.9m 2008: 6.4m being recognised in equity which will affect the income statement for the year ending 31 December 2010 when the collars mature.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps or to the time value of the interest rate collars.
The strike rates of these caps and collars are based on US dollar, euro and sterling LIBOR repricing every three months.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2009 1.0 0.3 1.0 0.3 2008 0.8 0.1 2.8 2.2 Foreign currency risk During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group adjusted the currencies of its borrowings to align them more closely to the respective functional currencies of its operating profit before depreciation and intangible amortisation EBITDA.
As a result, the majority of the Groups borrowings are effectively denominated in sterling, US dollars and euros.
This currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange contracts, long term cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency debt.
This currency composition minimises the impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
The cross currency interest rate swaps have been used to swap 57.8m of fixed US dollar bonds into fixed sterling bonds 2008: nil.
The cross currency interest rate swaps achieve cash flow hedge accounting for their interest rate risk element.
This cash flow hedge was effective during the year with a loss of 2.6m 2008: nil being recognised in equity which will affect the income statement from 2010 to 2015.
The currency profile of the Groups net debt is set out in the table below: 2009 2008 m m Sterling 220.0 653.2 US dollar 307.7 216.6 Euro 167.4 26.4 Other 21.7 27.3 716.8 870.7 The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are usually relatively limited.
Where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges.
However, the impact of foreign exchange on the purchase price of products which are bought in one currency relating to uncommitted future sales of those products in another currency is not hedged.
As a result sudden and significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing on to customers the resulting price increases.
For the year ended 31 December 2009 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 0.8m gain recognised in equity 2008: 1.5m which will affect the income statement during 2010.
