nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 24.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents adjusted profit before tax on the face of the Consolidated income statement disclosing those material items of operating income and expense which materially impact the underlying performance of the business.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods in assessing trends in financial performance.
a Statement of compliance The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2009.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and are included on pages 74 to 78. b Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation.
Adjustments are made to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRSs.
Intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intraGroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
3 Significant accounting estimates The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: a Impairment of goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cashgenerating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Further consideration of the impairment of goodwill is included in note 14. b Defined benefit pension schemes The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied are described in note 25 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Statement of recognised income and expense in future years and the future staff costs.
The carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2009 was 8,764,000 2008 1,592,000.
4 Summary of significant accounting policies a Revenue Revenue comprises fees in respect of initial and extension licences, annual licences and rentals, together with income from consultancy and other related services excluding VAT and similar taxes.
For each revenue stream, no revenue is recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Users can pay an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee.
Additional users can be licensed at any time on payment of an extension fee similar to the initial and annual fees.
The fees cover right to use and post contract support, which includes core product enhancements and remote support services.
The fees related to the right to use are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Post contract support fees are recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
As an alternative to the initial extension licence plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under two different types of rental contract.
Rentals which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
44 AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Group Annual report 2009 overview business review corporate governance financial statements 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued a Revenue continued Other rental contracts are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, are noncancellable and consist of two separate components, the right to use and the right for post contract support.
Revenue in respect of the right to use is recognised once the above conditions have been met and revenue for post contract support is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use the software over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for post contract support obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
The revenue and profit of development contracts is recognised on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
The stage of contract completion is usually determined by reference to the costs incurred to date as a proportion of the total estimated costs.
Only costs that reflect the services performed to date and to be performed are included in costs incurred to date and the estimate of total costs.
When the contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised to the extent that costs can be recovered, otherwise costs are expensed as incurred.
Income from consultancy and other related services is recognised as the services are provided.
b Foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is pounds Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date, and their Income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Prior to 31 March 2004, cumulative exchange differences were reported as part of retained earnings.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and is not required to record cumulative translation differences arising prior to the transition date.
In utilising this exemption, all cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero as at 1 April 2004 and all subsequent disposals shall exclude any translation differences arising prior to the date of transition and the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
c Goodwill The Group elected not to apply IFRS 3, Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that took place before 1 April 2004.
As a result, the carrying amount of goodwill in the opening IFRS Balance sheet is that recorded under UK GAAP at 1 April 2004 date of transition.
Goodwill on acquisitions after 1 April 2004 is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill already carried in the Balance sheet is not amortised after 1 April 2004.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the Income statement.
In addition, the Group also reduces the carrying value of the related goodwill by the amount that would have been recognised if the deferred tax asset had been recognised as an identifiable asset from the acquisition date with a corresponding entry to administrative expenses.
d Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible assets as set out below.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Amortisation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows: Years Developed technology 512 Customer relationships 20 Other software 3 Purchased software rights 510 Annual report 2009 Financial statements Group AVEVA Group plc 45 nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements continued 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued e Research expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Years Computer equipment 3 Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 68 Motor vehicles 4 Assets held under finance leases are amortised on a straightline basis over the period of the lease for three years or useful economic life, if shorter.
Leasehold improvements are amortised on a straightline basis over the period of the lease 3 to 49 years or useful economic life, if shorter.
Borrowing costs related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
g Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cashgenerating units.
The recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cashgenerating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
h Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and shortterm deposits in the Balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
j Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore all forward foreign exchange contracts have been markedtomarket and are held at fair value on the Balance sheet with any movements being recorded in the Income statement.
k Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
l Taxation Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
46 AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Group Annual report 2009 overview business review corporate governance financial statements 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued l Taxation continued Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised: except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the Income statement.
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Balance sheet.
m Post retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany.
The Group also provides certain post employment benefits to its South Korean employees.
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002.
UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit scheme is closed to new applicants and provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992 by Tribon.
No current employees participate in the scheme.
Full provision has been made for the liability on the Balance sheet.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industrywide defined benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation.
The retirement benefit liability in the Balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate derived from a published index of AA rated corporate bonds as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
The current service cost is recognised in the Income statement as an employee benefit expense.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the Income statement as finance revenue and finance costs respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in the Statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and nonUK employees.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
Annual report 2009 Financial statements Group AVEVA Group plc 47 nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements continued 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued n Sharebased payments The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, further details of which are given in note 26.
In valuing equitysettled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of AVEVA Group plc market conditions.
The cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equitysettled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equitysettled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
o Employee benefit trust The Group has established an employee benefit trust AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 which is a separately administered trust and is funded by loans from Group companies.
The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc and cash balances.
The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
p New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations that could have a potential impact on the Group with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IASs IFRSs Effective date IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellation 1 January 2009 IFRS 3R Business Combinations 1 July 2009 IAS 27R Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2009 IAS 32 and IAS 1R Financial Instruments Puttable at Fair Value and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 1 January 2009 IAS 23 Borrowing Costs 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Payments 1 July 2008 IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 October 2008 IFRIC 17 Distribution of Noncash Assets 1 July 2009 Standards applicable to accounting periods commencing on or after the effective date.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.

48 AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Group Annual report 2009 overview business review corporate governance financial statements 6 Segment information For management purposes, during the year the Group was organised on a geographical basis into four main sales regions: Asia Pacific, Americas, Central Eastern and Southern Europe CES and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa WEMEA.
Corporate functions and Research and Development operations are principally based in the UK and Sweden and are therefore not included in the sales regions analysis.
Each of these operating regions is organised and managed separately due to the differing local requirements in each market and therefore these are the primary segments.
The Group operates in one business segment: that of the supply of Engineering IT Solutions that supports the creation and operation of major capital assets such as power plants, process plants and ships of both naval and commercial type.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 26.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated based on an adjusted profit after tax of 45,576,000 2008 37,228,000 obtained by adding intangible amortisation excluding other software of 2,482,000 2008 2,276,000, sharebased payments of 940,000 2008 315,000 and adjustment to carrying value of goodwill of nil 2008 391,000 to the profit after tax for the year of 42,154,000 2008 34,246,000.
The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share.
The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has not been adjusted for tax in either the current or preceding year.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is a fairer presentation of the underlying performance of the business.

The total consideration was 20,277,000 and goodwill of 14,079,000 arose on the acquisition.
On 31 March 2005, the Group completed the acquisition of Realitywave Inc.
The consideration was 3,192,000 and goodwill of 1,855,000 arose on the acquisition.
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of rights to integrate, develop and market 3D design software from AEA Technology on 30 March 1999.
The initial cost of goodwill was 2,169,000.
On 12 November 1998, AVEVA agreed to acquire from the distributor Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha all AVEVAs business in Japan.
The goodwill arising on acquisition was 500,000.
The adjustment to the carrying value of the Tribon Solutions AB goodwill in the previous period was due to the postacquisition utilisation of tax losses, which was not recognised as a deferred tax asset on acquisition.
Annual report 2009 Financial statements Group AVEVA Group plc 53 nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements continued 14 Goodwill continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cashgenerating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as follows: Asia WEMEA Pacific CES Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2009 000 000 000 000 000 Tribon Solutions AB 302 7,934 6,075 327 14,638 Realitywave Inc. 276 276 276 276 1,104 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 578 8,547 6,351 1,579 17,055 Asia WEMEA Pacific CES Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2008 000 000 000 000 000 Tribon Solutions AB 301 7,907 6,054 328 14,590 Realitywave Inc. 197 196 197 196 786 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 498 8,440 6,251 1,500 16,689 The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on managements estimates of growth in those specific markets based on past experience and external market information.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending 31 March 2010 and extrapolates cash flows for future years based on an average estimated growth rate of 2% for each CGU 2008 10% to 15%, representing the long term average growth rate for the Groups CGUs.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pretax 2008 10%.
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.

These leases have a duration of between one and five years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
23 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and shortterm deposits, bank overdrafts, finance leases and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
58 AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Group Annual report 2009 overview business review corporate governance financial statements 23 Financial risk management continued a Market risk continued Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk is associated with shortterm cash deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice this has meant that no deposits have been made with a maturity date greater than three months in the course of the year.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents.
The Group does not have any significant borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents balances.
A 1% decrease in the Sterling and US dollar interest rate would have reduced interest income by approximately 1,033,000 2008 551,000 and profit after tax by 738,000 2008 386,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US dollar and Euro reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group reduces these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US dollar and Euro as appropriate.
The Group enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US dollars and Euro to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $23.5 million 2008 $13.5 million and 15.2 million 2008 11 million.
In addition, the Group utilises option instruments which have various provisions that, depending on the spot rate at maturity, give either the Group or the counterparty the option to exercise.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had outstanding currency options under which the Group may, under certain circumstances, be required to sell up to $10.5 million 2008 $19.5 million and nil 2008 13 million in exchange for Sterling.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
There is currently no requirement for borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.

Annual report 2009 Financial statements Group AVEVA Group plc 59 nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for deposits are governed by the Treasury policy which has been approved by the Board and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit as set out in the Groups treasury policy.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 18. c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the Balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
f Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising of issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2008 or 2009.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.
24 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon during the current and preceding year: Accelerated Retirement capital Land and benefit Intangible Share allowances buildings obligations assets options Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2008 106 220 189 2,502 1,395 1,922 678 Charge credit to Income statement 44 7 159 507 194 1,986 2,579 Charge credit to equity 2,105 220 1,375 510 Exchange adjustment 4 154 158 At 31 March 2009 58 213 2,135 2,215 214 4,062 3,925 A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Annual report 2009 Financial statements Group AVEVA Group plc 61 nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements continued 24 Deferred tax continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2009 2008 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 1,589 2,065 Deferred tax assets 5,514 2,743 3,925 678 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 3,810,000 2008 1,006,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 1,287,000 2008 334,000, 580,000 2008 56,000 has been recognised and is included in other above.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the balance due to the unpredictability of future profit streams, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 38,800,000 2008 27,500,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.

This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of reopening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.
There is an insurance policy in place which covers this liability.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a Trust Deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, BDO Stoy Hayward Investment Management Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The employees contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance sheet dates.
62 AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Group Annual report 2009 overview business review corporate governance financial statements 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued a UK defined benefit scheme continued To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on riskfree investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Main assumptions: Rate of salary increases 5.10 5.50 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.00 3.20 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 3.10 3.50 Discount rate 6.60 6.60 Inflation assumption 3.10 3.20 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 7.

The total contributions in 2010 are expected to be approximately 2,387,000.
The assumed discount rate, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Impact on deficit increase decrease m 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1,475 inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 845 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 586 The assets and liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2009 and 2008 were as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Equities 18,379 25,478 Bonds 6,976 6,057 Other 3,336 1,396 Total fair value of assets 28,691 32,931 Present value of scheme liabilities 36,313 33,600 Net pension liability 7,622 669 Annual report 2009 Financial statements Group AVEVA Group plc 63 nOtes tO the COnsOliDateD finanCial statements continued 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued a UK defined benefit scheme continued The amounts recognised in the Consolidated income statement and Statement of recognised income and expense for the year are analysed as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Recognised in the Consolidated income statement Current service cost Cost of sales 715 960 Selling and distribution costs 196 390 Administrative expenses 182 117 Total operating charge 1,093 1,467 Finance revenue Expected return on pension scheme assets 2,031 2,013 Finance costs Interest on pension scheme liabilities 2,251 1,930 Taken to Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on pension scheme assets 6,012 780 Less: expected return on pension scheme assets 2,031 2,013 8,043 2,793 Changes in assumptions and experience adjustments on liabilities 526 6,156 Actuarial loss gain recognised in Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 7,517 3,363 Analysis of movements in the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations during the year are analysed as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 At 1 April 33,600 36,368 Current service costs 1,093 1,467 Contributions by employees 469 463 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 2,251 1,930 Benefits paid 551 435 Premiums paid 23 37 Actuarial gain 526 6,156 At 31 March 36,313 33,600 The above defined benefit obligation arises from a plan that is wholly funded.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of 8,500,000 in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004. b German defined benefit schemes There are two defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH.
Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 2009 2008 Rate of increase of pension in payment 1.75%2.50% 0% Discount rate 5.50%6.20% 4.75%5.50% Mortality 14 years 14 years Rate of salary increases 0%2.50% 2.50% The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH schemes was 60 and 63 years of age respectively 2008 60 and 63 years of age.

The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multiemployer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2009, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 122% 2008 141% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
The total cost charged to income was 545,000 2008 570,000. e Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 2,002,000 2008 1,507,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.
26 Sharebased payment plans The Group operates four equitysettled share option schemes, the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP : the AVEVA Group plc Employee and Executive Share Option Scheme Executive Scheme and Employee Scheme respectively : and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 2007 scheme.
The Executive and Employee schemes lapsed in 2006 and no grants have been made under the 2007 scheme which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2007.
The Group also operates a deferred annual bonus share plan.
Details of these plans are set out below.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised is 14.78 2008 10.20.
Share options have been granted under both plans to certain employees of the Group and remain outstanding as follows: Number Number Share of options of options Exercise option 2009 2008 price Date of grant plan Number Number Pence 12 July 2001 Employee Scheme 12,050 159.83 12 July 2001 Executive Scheme 55,732 159.83 1 July 2004 LTIP 27,000 3.33 20 July 2005 Employee Scheme 11,304 265.33 20 July 2005 Executive Scheme 42,764 244,227 265.33 28 June 2006 LTIP 78,648 78,648 3.33 2 July 2007 LTIP 55,506 59,663 3.33 7 July 2008 LTIP 50,033 3.33 15 July 2008 Deferred Share Scheme 36,448 0.00 263,399 488,624 The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2009 is 5.0 years 2008 3.3 years.
The average fair value of options granted during the year was 14.13 2008 9.38.
In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

The Group recognised total expenses of 940,000 and 315,000 related to equitysettled sharebased payment transactions in the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Details of the share option plans are as follows: a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The following awards have been made under the LTIP.
The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 3.33 pence.
Options under the LTIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
2008 09 awards On 7 July 2008, a total of 50,033 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP.
The performance conditions are based on average growth in earnings per share over the years from 2008 09 to 2010 11.
If average EPS growth is greater than 14% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share is less than 10% per annum then none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 10% and 14% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation.
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2009.

This scheme was used because the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option and Employee Share Option schemes originally introduced in 1996 had expired and the new scheme, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 12 July 2007, had not yet been established.
The performance conditions are based on average growth in earnings per share over the years from 2007 08 to 2009 10.
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 11.5% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 9% and 11.5% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2008.

These options are subject to performance conditions which are based on average growth in earnings per share achieved over the three years from 2006 07 to 2008 09.
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation.

The extent to which the options are exercisable will depend on the ranking of the Company in terms of total shareholder return measured against other companies in the London Stock Exchange techMARK 100 index.
The performance conditions were measured three years from the date of grant and all options vested in full.
The contractual life of each option granted is seven years and the options become exercisable three years after the date of grant.
The options lapse if the option holder leaves the employment of the Group with certain specific exceptions.
The fair value of an award of shares under the LTIP has been adjusted to take into account Total Shareholder Return TSR as a marketbased performance condition, using a pricing model that takes into account expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the comparator group.
The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2005: Year ended 31 March 2005 Dividend yield 1.23% Expected volatility 30.00% Riskfree interest rate 5.09% Expected life of the option 3 years Weighted average share price 1.83 Weighted average exercise price 0.03 b Employee and executive share option plan Options have also been granted under the AVEVA Group plc Employee Share Option Scheme and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme The Employee and Executive Scheme.
The exercise price is equal to the market price at the time of the award.
Options under this plan are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and seventh anniversaries of the date of grant.
Pre2004 awards All options awarded under the Employee and Executive Scheme were subject to performance conditions, which required earnings per share to outperform RPI utilisation by a total of 10% over a three year rolling period.
The share option rules were established at the time of the Companys initial public offering in 1996 and the performance conditions set were commonly used at that time.
2005 06 awards On 20 July 2005, a total of 255,531 options were awarded under the Employee and Executive Scheme.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option would be that earnings per share in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2006.

The option may be exercised in the 42day period beginning on the announcement of the financial results of the Group in each of the three calendar years after that in which the option was granted.
The last date of the exercise is the end of the 42day period following the announcement of the financial results of the Group in the third calendar year following that in which the option was granted or if applicable such later date as the Remuneration Committee may specify.
