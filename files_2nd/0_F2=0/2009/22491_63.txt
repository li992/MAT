62 Close Brothers Annual Report 2009 Financial Statements The Notes 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Hedge accounting In designating a financial instrument as part of a qualifying hedge relationship, the directors have determined that the hedge is expected to be highly effective over the life of the hedging instrument.
In accounting for a derivative as a cash flow hedge, the directors have determined that the future cash flows of the hedged exposure are highly probable.
The group is required to assess on an ongoing basis whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
If a hedge was deemed partially ineffective but continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the amount of the ineffectiveness, taking into account the timing of the expected cash flows where relevant, would be recorded in the income statement.
If the hedge is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective the group discontinues hedge accounting.
Share-based awards The cost of the groups long-term equity based incentive schemes are determined using commonly accepted valuation techniques.
The models used take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
The fair value of the market related element of awards is calculated by comparing the companys TSR performance against a comparator group of companies.
Vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually do, vest.
Details of the above variables can be found in note 31.
Segmental analysis The directors manage the group primarily by class of business and present the segmental analysis on that basis.
The groups activities are organised in three primary divisions namely Banking, Asset Management and Securities.
A description of the activities of these divisions is given in the Business Review.
The group previously had another primary division, Corporate Finance.
This division was disposed of in July 2009 and has been classified as a discontinued operation in these financial statements.
Divisions charge market prices for services rendered to other parts of the group.
Funding charges between segments are determined by the Banking divisions treasury operation having regard to commercial demands.
Substantially all of the groups activities and revenue are located within the British Isles.
