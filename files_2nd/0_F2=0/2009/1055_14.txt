Overview Business Review Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 17 Mining 1 Securing and strengthening the Core Business Los Pelambres Los Pelambres is a sulphide deposit located in Chiles Coquimbo Region, 240 km north-east of Santiago.
It produces copper concentrate containing gold and silver and molybdenum concentrate, through a milling and Completion of the Los Pelambres plant expansion is flotation process.
expected to increase plant throughput by approximately Revenue at Los Pelambres in 2009 was US$2,081.5 million, slightly 30%, from the current 130,000 tonnes per day level to below the US$2,172.0 million achieved in 2008.
The reduction reflected a 175,000 tonnes per day level in 2010.
As a result, the a decrease in copper volumes and the lower molybdenum price, largely offset by an increase in the realised copper price.
production of payable copper is expected to be 407,000 tonnes in 2010, compared with 311,600 tonnes in 2009.
Los Pelambres produced 311,600 tonnes of payable copper in 2009, a reduction compared to the 2008 full year production of 339,200 tonnes, although ahead of the original forecast for the year of 300,000 tonnes.
The decrease in production compared to 2008 was mainly due to lower plant throughput due to the higher level of harder primary ore and a marginal decrease in ore grades.
Ore throughput averaged 129,200 tonnes per day 2008 136,800 tonnes per day, while the ore grade in the area of the open pit mined during the year was 0.74% copper 2008 0.76%.
Molybdenum production was unchanged from 2008 at 7,800 tonnes, with marginally higher ore grades and metallurgical recoveries offsetting the lower plant throughput.
Realised copper prices at Los Pelambres were 286.8 cents per pound, 16% higher than the 2008 realised price of 246.5 cents per pound.
This was despite the average LME price for the year of 234.2 cents per pound actually being 26% lower than in the previous year 2008 315.3 cents per pound.
The general increase in the copper price during 2009 resulted in positive pricing adjustments of US$380.3 million, reflecting both the settlement of open sales in the year and the impact of mark-to-market adjustments at the beginning and end of the year.
Conversely, the sharp fall in the copper price in the second half of 2008 resulted in negative adjustments of US$541.9 million in 2008.
Realised molybdenum prices were US$11.3 per pound 2008 US$23.9 per pound which was broadly in line with the average market price of US$11.1 per pound 2008 US$28.9 per pound.
Further details of pricing adjustments for both copper and molybdenum are given in the Financial Review on pages 42 and 43 Key data for 2009 and in Note 25 d to the financial statements.

As explained below Los Pelambres is also continuing to review options for the long-term development of the mine.
The total mineral resources base for Los Pelambres is 6.2 billion tonnes, compared with the 1.5 billion tonnes of ore reserves reported.
This will present opportunities for longer-term planning either to extend the existing mine life or by enabling Los Pelambres to consider possibilities for long-term future growth.

The ore grade for the year is expected to average 0.72%.
Accordingly, forecast production of payable copper for 2010 is expected to remain at approximately 407,000 tonnes, a 30% increase on 2009.
Molybdenum production is also expected to be significantly higher than 2009 at 9,500 tonnes, due to the higher plant throughput, although the increased throughput is expected to be partly offset by slightly lower molybdenum grades of approximately 0.019%.
It now comprises two open-pit mines feeding a heap-leach operation and a run-of-mine ROM leaching operation, which produces During 2009 the El Tesoro plant began processing copper cathodes using a solvent-extraction electro-winning process.

These additional resources extend Copper cathode production for 2009 was 90,200 tonnes compared with the mine life to 2019.
As a result of the full year impact 90,800 tonnes in 2008.

These projects mitigate the decline in grades that would expected to increase to 96,000 tonnes, from the otherwise occur from mining exclusively from the original open pit and 90,200 tonnes produced in 2009. extend the life of the operation to 2019.
The heap-leach operation processed 9.8 million tonnes of ore during 2009.
Of this, 8.3 million tonnes was feed from El Tesoro and Tesoro North-East open pits and 1.5 million tonnes was feed of sufficiently high grade oxide ore from the pre-stripping of the Esperanza open pit.
The ore grade of this combined heap-leach feed averaged 1.25% copper, an increase on the 1.16% grade in 2008.
This higher average grade was a result of the blend of ore from the three sources, with better grades at El Tesoro and Tesoro North-East offsetting the comparatively lower grades of the feed from the Esperanza open pit.
Plant throughput of ore averaged 26,200 tonnes per day, compared with 28,500 tonnes per day in 2008.
Metallurgical recoveries at the SX-EW plant were also slightly below 2008.
Construction work for ROM processing of the Esperanza oxide cap was substantially completed during 2009, with the only work remaining being the replacement of pump impellers required to reach design pumping capacity, which is expected to be achieved in the first quarter of 2010.
Production from the ROM commenced in the second half of 2009, and by December had reached over 1,000 tonnes of copper in cathode per month.

copper market in the latter part of 2008 El Tesoro implemented measures to minimise costs during 2009.
This included the deferral of non-essential material movement and waste removal not required for current production to minimise the volume of material moved at the open pit.
There will be a resultant increase in material movement, and related costs, during 2010 as this deferred activity is implemented.
22 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Business Review Mining continued 1 Securing and strengthening the Core Business For 2010, cathode production is expected to be approximately 96,000 tonnes due to the full year impact of production from the Tesoro North-East deposit and the ROM processing.
Production from the ROM is expected to reach nearly 2,000 tonnes per month by the last quarter of 2010, and to contribute almost 20% of El Tesoros total production of cathodes in 2010.
The Tesoro North-East deposit is forecast to be responsible for approximately 60% of El Tesoros total production in 2010, with the balance from the original El Tesoro pit.
Average ore grades from the original open pit and the Tesoro North-East deposit but excluding the ROM operation are expected to remain relatively stable at approximately 1.24% copper.
Cash costs at El Tesoro for 2010 are expected to average approximately 156 cents per pound, largely as a result of higher levels of material movement, partly reflecting the work deferred from 2009 as part of the cost reduction programme, partially offset by a significantly lower contracted sulphuric acid price.
Under its updated mine plan which was approved in 2009 El Tesoro should be able to maintain annual production at approximately the 90,000 tonnes level until at least 2013, when lower ore grades under the existing mine plan cause output to decrease.
As explained in the Sierra Gorda section below, the Group has an ongoing exploration programme in the Sierra Gorda district to identify further oxide deposits that could in future years provide additional ore to the El Tesoro plant.
In particular, feasibility work is being performed in respect of the Mirador oxide deposit, as a potential source of higher grade Maximising the potential ore.
Such deposits could be used to both offset reductions in production of El Tesoro levels due to declining grades, as well as to potentially extend the life of the operation beyond the current mine plan which runs until 2019.
The start-up of production from the Tesoro North-East deposit and the run-of-mine ROM operation during the year represented a significant step in the development of the Sierra Gorda mining district the area surrounding El Tesoro and Esperanza where the Group also owns or controls a number of other mining properties.
It demonstrates the synergies and opportunities which can arise from having operations and mining properties located in close proximity to each other in this area.
The oxide ore which had to be removed as part of the pre-stripping of the main sulphide deposit at Esperanza is already being profitably processed through the El Tesoro plant.
Along with the additional resources from the Tesoro North-East pit it should be possible to maintain production at the El Tesoro plant at around the 90,000 tonnes level until at least 2013.
The original mine plan for El Tesoro envisaged production of approximately half that volume over the same period.
Once the Esperanza plant is operational by the end of 2010 the Group will also have a concentrate plant processing sulphide ore in the area.
The combination of the oxide and sulphide plants gives important optionality to the Group, particularly as the Group continues to conduct exploration and evaluation work on its mining properties in the Sierra Gorda district such as Caracoles and Mirador, which contain both sulphide and oxide deposits.
Overview Business Review Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 23 Revenue at Michilla for 2009 was US$170.5 million, against US$332.7 Michilla million in 2008, as a result of a lower realised copper price and reduced Michilla has approved an extension of its mine plan production volumes.

Michilla is a sulphide and oxide deposit ahead of the original forecast for the year of 38,000 tonnes, although lower located in Chiles Antofagasta Region, 1,500 km north than the 2008 production of 47,700 tonnes.
The reduction compared with the prior year was mainly due to the decision at the start of 2009 to suspend of Santiago.
It produces copper cathodes using a heapoperations at the higher cost Lince open pit mine and certain third-party leach and solvent-extraction electro-winning process.
workings, given the weak copper price environment at that point.
Accordingly, ore throughput averaged 15,100 tonnes per day compared to 15,500 tonnes in 2008.
Ore grades were 0.96% compared with 1.06% in 2008, partly due to the decision to process lower-grade ore stockpiles which became economic as the copper price strengthened during the year.
Realised copper prices in the period were 195.7 cents per pound, a significant reduction compared with the 317.7 cents per pound realised in 2008.
This was predominantly due to the lower average LME copper price over the course of the year, which in 2009 averaged 234.2 cents per pound, compared with 315.3 cents in 2008.
In addition, realised losses of US$45.8 million in respect of copper derivatives which had been put in place in late 2008 and early 2009, and which matured during the course of the year, also decreased the realised price.
These effects were partly offset by positive provisional pricing adjustments of US$11.8 million.
Further details of the effects of commodity hedging instruments in place are given in the Financial Review under Treasury Management and Hedging and in Note 25 e to the financial statements.
Cash costs averaged 157.6 cents per pound during 2009, compared with 191.1 cents in 2008.
This was mainly due to cost savings from the suspension of the Lince open pit, lower electricity prices and the weakening of the Chilean peso.
Costs increased during the course of the year, partly as a result of the improving copper price.
Michilla purchases a portion of the ore which it processes through its plant from third parties and the price paid for some of those materials was linked to the market value of the contained copper.
High copper prices in the year accordingly resulted in higher materials cost.
The decision to process lower-grade ore stockpiles given the increasing copper price also resulted in higher operating costs.

During the year Michilla approved an extension of its mine plan through to 2012, which includes the remnant reserves from the final stage of the Lince pit.
Michilla is currently carrying out studies to examine the potential to extend the life of the operation to 2018.
In 2010 cash costs are expected to be approximately 162 cents per pound, a slight increase compared with the 157.6 cents per pound in 2009.
Increased costs due to the reopening of the Lince open pit and other operational and market factors are expected to be largely offset by a significant reduction in the contracted price for sulphuric acid.

In addition, the concentrate is expected to contain an annual average of 215,000 ounces of payable gold, as well as silver which is treated as a by-product credit.
Cash costs before by-product credits are currently estimated to be approximately 136 cents per pound over the same period.
The gold by-product is expected to reduce cash costs on average during this period by approximately five cents per pound per US$100 in the gold price.
There is potential for molybdenum production from 2015 at a rate of 2,000 tonnes per year over the following ten years.
The adjacent Telgrafo Sur and Telgrafo Norte deposits could utilise the Esperanza plant and facilities well beyond Esperanzas mine life.
All key contracts relating to the construction are in progress.
