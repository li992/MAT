146 Financial Statements 15 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables and concentrations of credit risk are disclosed in Note 16.
Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated though a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US Treasury bills, US Treasury funds, AAA-rated liquidity funds and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2009 was $4,636m invested in US Treasury funds and $3,699m in US Treasury bills, which each bear credit exposure to the US government.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
During the year the Group has entered into agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2009 was $2m.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded, in the Statement of Financial Position.

The adjustments have increased total assets at 31 December 2008 by $166m and at 31 December 2007 by $31m and have decreased current assets at 31 December 2008 by $283m and at 31 December 2007 by $86m.
The adjustments have had no effect on net assets or net income for the year.

3 Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships or related to financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Other financial assets represent trade and other receivables Note 12 excluding prepayments and accrued income.
Other financial liabilities represent trade and other payables Note 17 excluding deferred income.
Credit risk decreased the fair value of the bonds designated as fair value through profit or loss by $145m for the year and increased the fair value by $35m since designation.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments together with their carrying values are as follows: Cash and overdrafts held on the Statement of Financial Position at amortised costs.
Fair value approximates to carrying value.
Loans due within one year and after more than one year the fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year-end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value.
For loans designated in a fair-value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair-value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments consists of interest rate swaps included in designated as fair value through profit or loss if related to debt designated at fair value, or instruments in a hedge relationship as a fair-value hedge or other derivatives, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts included in other derivatives.
All derivatives are held at fair value.
Interest rate swaps the fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates current at year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts the majority of contracts for existing transactions had maturities of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
Foreign currency option contracts the fair value of option contracts is estimated using Black-Scholes valuation techniques.

These include equity securities held on the Statement of Financial Position as other investments Note 10.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments, carrying values approximate fair value.
Other financial assets and other financial liabilities held on the Statement of Financial Position at amortised costs with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Derivatives 2.0% to 4.6% 3.8% to 4.6% 4.3% to 5.1% Loans and borrowings 2.0% to 4.6% 3.8% to 4.6% 4.3% to 5.1% Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie, as prices or indirectly ie, derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

$94m fair value losses on derivatives related to debt instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss and $53m fair value losses on debt instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss have been included within interest and fair value adjustments in respect of debt designated at fair value through profit or loss, net of derivatives.
The accounting treatment for debt designated at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Accounting Policies section from page 128.
The loss on cash flow hedge in connection with debt issue included in other comprehensive income relates to the amortisation of a loss on a cash flow hedge of a prospective debt issue which was taken directly to reserves in 2007.
The total loss is being amortised through profit over the remaining life of the underlying debt instrument.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 150 Financial Statements 16 Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2009, 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 is set out below.
In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk Translational In 2009, the US Dollar was generally stronger than in the prior year against our six principal currency exposures: sterling GBP, Swedish krona SEK, euro EUR, Australian dollar AUD, Japanese yen JPY and Canadian dollar CAD.
The weakness of our cost currencies sterling and Swedish krona relative to the euro which is our main non-US dollar income currency has resulted in a small net benefit for the Group.
During the year a series of option-based currency hedges were executed to protect the Group from adverse exchange rate movements and all matured during the period without being exercised.
The cost of executing these hedges is recorded through profit.
Transactional 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
The table below sets out the principal foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2009, 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 along with the underlying gross exposure as defined above.

The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2009, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2009, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $32m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2009, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below.
31 December 2009 Interest rates Exchange rates 1% -1% 10% -10% Increase decrease in fair value of financial instruments 602 709 137 137 Impact on profit: gain loss 134 134 Impact on equity: gain loss 271 271 31 December 2008 Interest rates Exchange rates 1% -1% 10% -10% Increase decrease in fair value of financial instruments 587 706 217 217 Impact on profit: gain loss 57 57 Impact on equity: gain loss 274 274 31 December 2007 Interest rates Exchange rates 1% -1% 10% -10% Increase decrease in fair value of financial instruments 666 779 165 165 Impact on profit: gain loss 37 37 Impact on equity: gain loss 202 202 There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the above sensitivity analysis over the three-year period.
Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets, being cash and cash equivalents, derivative assets, other investments and other financial assets consisting of trade and other receivables represent the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2009 2008 2007 $m $m $m US 2,229 2,032 1,961 UK 482 459 425 Sweden 245 226 260 Euro zone countries 762 833 901 Other European countries 295 257 247 Japan 950 955 771 Other countries 819 796 761 5,782 5,558 5,326 In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 81% of US sales 2008: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 81%: 2007: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 82%.
