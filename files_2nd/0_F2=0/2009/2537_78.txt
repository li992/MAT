The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases in the period to August 2010 have been assessed to be effective and a net unrealised gain of 1.3m 2008: unrealised gain of 0.3m, with a related deferred tax liability of 0.4m 2008: related deferred tax liability of 0.1m, has been included in equity in respect of these contracts.

The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
of shares 2009 2008 Annual free shares award 675,573 477, 862 Matching shares award 1 free share for every ordinary share purchased 464,205 422,225 The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2008: 40% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an optionholder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
