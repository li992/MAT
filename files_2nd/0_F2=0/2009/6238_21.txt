2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Companys financial statements are also consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been valued at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars US$ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand US$000 except when otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
b Standards, interpretations and amendment The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 except for the adoption of certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards.
Those that are applicable to the Company are as follows: IFRS 8 Operating Segments is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard introduces the management approach to segment reporting.
IFRS 8, which is mandatory for the Companys 2009 financial information, requires the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker, as dened in IFRS 8, in order to assess each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
The adoption of this standard does not impact the Companys financial statements as segmental information is provided in the Companys consolidated financial statements.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The statement of changes in equity now includes only details of transactions with owners, with nonowner changes in equity presented as a single line.
In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Company has taken the exemption c hZXi dc %- d[ i]Z 8dbeVc Zh 6Xi '%% cdi id Y hXadhZ Vc cXdbZ HiViZbZci# IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amended standard requires additional disclosure about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
Fair value measurements are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level hierarchy for each class of financial instrument.
In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for Level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well as significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.
The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures.
& % FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statementscertain amendments are effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendments require that all dividends from subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities or associates are recognised in the income statement.
Accordingly, all dividends received from subsidiaries have been recognised in the income statement.
Improvements to IFRSs In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
None of the amendments that are effective for the year ended 31 December 2009 had any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company.
None of the amendments that are effective for the year beginning 1 January 2010 are expected to have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company.
c significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimation is in the accounting policies and or the notes to the financial statements.
Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: 9ZiZgb cVi dc d[ [jcXi dcVa XjggZcXn cdiZ ' Y The determination of functional currency requires management judgment, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Estimates and assumptions significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the consolidated financial information include: cXdbZ iVm cdiZh ' d VcY Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.
Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash ows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.
To the extent that future cash ows and taxable income differ signicantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
"beV gbZci d[ VkV aVWaZ""[dg""hVaZ VhhZih cdiZ ' VcY, The Company classies certain financial assets as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity."
When the fair value declines, management assesses the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss.

Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge.

The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future events.
d Foreign currency translation The Companys financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.
The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.
e Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
f Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classied as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held to maturity investments: or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classied as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss on inception are included in this category.
Financial assets are classied as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term.
Derivatives are also classied as heldfor-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for beV gbZci# V ch VcY adhhZh VgZ gZXd c hZY c cXdbZ l]Zc i]Z adVch VcY gZXZ kVWaZh VgZ YZgZXd c hZY dg beV gZY!
Vh lZaa Vh i]gdj ] i]Z amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classied in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent investments that have a quoted market price in an active market, therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement, available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity.
Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available and for listed non-actively traded securities, fair value is determined using a valuation technique.
Valuation techniques include using a recent arms length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis and option pricing models.
If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value.
& ' FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT g Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income hiViZbZci# c VhhZhh c l]Zi]Zg i]ZgZ h Vc beV gbZci!

Reversals in respect of equity instruments classied as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement.
h Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value.
Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.
For the purposes of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents as dened above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
i Share Capital Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue.
The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
j Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
k Financial liabilities The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.

l Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial information and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial information, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable.
m Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benets will ow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
Trademark Royalties Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received.
Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method: i. e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
n Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability.
o Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: i where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: i where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
& FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
p fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally fide-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
q Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in prices of base metals and foreign exchange which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
c i]Z gdjeh Xdchda YViZY cVcX Va hiViZbZcih i]ZhZ YZg kVi kZ chigjbZcih VgZ YZh cViZY Vh XVh] dl ]ZY Zh Wji [dg i]Z ejgedhZh d[ i]Z Companys stand alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash ow hedges.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value applicable to the specic type of derivative instrument.
The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that signicantly modies the cash ows.
Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
r Dividend Distribution Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
s Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
t Borrowing costs Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the nancing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use.
In the case of such qualifying assets, finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use.
The amount of finance costs capitalised before the effects of income tax for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period.

From this date companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU.
& FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT IETU is calculated at the rate of 16.5% for the calendar year 2008, 17% for 2009 and 17.5% for subsequent years and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods.
In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income.
In respect of the Company, management has undertaken calculations to determine the impact of the new IETU provisions on the Company.
As a result of such analysis, management has concluded that there should be no material impact on the Company, other than a US$6.1 million tax credit arising under IETU that is recognised in 2009 since the mainstream corporate income tax liability of the Company is forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge.
Accordingly, no IETU liability should arise in the foreseeable future.

Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest.
