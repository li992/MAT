c Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below: i Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective Group entities.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, New Taiwan dollars and Korean won.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets is designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
An analysis of borrowings by currency and their fair values as at the balance sheet date is given below: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Sterling 22.0 22.0 Singapore dollar 97.1 97.1 174.8 174.1 US dollar 189.1 189.1 236.4 236.4 New Zealand dollar 24.0 24.0 24.9 24.9 Korean won 26.0 26.0 34.0 34.0 Malaysian ringgit 1.8 1.8 5.1 5.1 338.0 338.0 497.2 496.5 100 101 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 23.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short-term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate.
As at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 no such contracts were in place.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate Sterling 2009 2008 2009 2008 US dollar 1.553 1.859 1.596 1.474 Singapore dollar 2.257 2.628 2.245 2.132 New Taiwan dollar 51.654 59.464 51.081 49.295 New Zealand dollar 2.461 2.592 2.253 2.563 Malaysia ringgit 5.472 6.200 5.473 5.139 Korean won 1,969.72 1,995.67 1,847.74 1,878.41 Euro 1.114 1.261 1.110 1.052 Sensitivity analysis With respect to the Groups foreign currency translation exposure, and assuming that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant, it is estimated that a 25 percent strengthening of sterling against the following currencies at 31 December 2009 31 December 2008: 25 percent would have decreased equity and profit or loss before tax by the amounts shown below: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 Profit Profit Equity before tax Equity before tax m m m m US dollar 100.4 0.7 100.8 10.9 Singapore dollar 66.1 7.5 27.8 2.2 New Taiwan dollar 38.3 1.7 48.3 2.4 New Zealand dollar 29.6 2.2 41.5 3.1 Malaysia ringgit 11.6 1.0 12.0 0.8 Korean won 21.2 2.7 24.8 2.3 Euro 10.2 1.5 17.1 0.5 277.4 12.9 272.3 22.2 A 25 percent weakening of sterling against the above currencies at 31 December 2009 31 December 2008: 25 percent would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
ii Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floating rates presently as this flexibility is being considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings.
The Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Groups balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2009 no interest rate derivatives were in place 2008: nil.
