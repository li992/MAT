Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC Company, a company incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 23 February 2010.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 73 to 77.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Groups positive cash position and lack of debt.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes: Note 11 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment Note 12 revenue recognition Note 12 provision for doubtful debts Note 13 accruals Note 17 share-based payments Basis of consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007.
These comprised the incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon Nixons 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited from third parties.
The acquisition of Simon Nixons shares was between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction.
The acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
As a result the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages.
This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2009 Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign operation icero GmbH is the euro.
The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred.
The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue Internet business The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer.
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Office equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2009 55 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and noncontractual customer relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately.
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in SIC 32.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2009 Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the share awards made is measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short term employee benefits Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media.
Costs associated with the production of adverts are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is delivered to the Group in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying.
The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Net finance income Net finance income comprises interest payable and interest receivable, which are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they accrue using the effective interest method.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the prior year as 28% of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which were generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
At the prior year end, this liability was remeasured at the enacted corporation tax rate of 28%, this being the rate at which the liability will unwind.
This liability will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2009 57 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves where applicable.
The Group manages its cash balances by depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk.
The Group had no debt as at 31 December 2009 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements: management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Accounting standards issued but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 December 2009 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group: IAS 27 Amended 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and applies prospectively.
The standard deals with changes to the accounting for non-controlling minority interest and deals primarily with the accounting for changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries after control is obtained, the accounting for the loss of control of subsidiaries, and the allocation of profit or loss to controlling and non-controlling interests in a subsidiary.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised 2008 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and applies prospectively.
Key changes are that transaction costs are expensed other than debt equity income costs previously all costs were capitalised, goodwill is fixed at the date of acquisition, subsequent adjustments go through the income statement, contingent payments which require future services such as an earn out that are forfeited if employment ceases are treated, in full, as post acquisition remuneration.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future reporting periods.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2009 Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3 Segmental information Business segments In adopting IFRS 8 Operating Segments for the first time, the Group has disclosed four reportable segments, being Money, Insurance, Travel and Home.
This disclosure correlates with the information which is presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which reviews revenue by segment.
The Groups costs, finance income, tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at a consolidated level, and therefore have not been allocated between segments in the analysis below.

The effective tax rate for 2008 was therefore estimated at 28.5%.
Unrecognised tax losses The Group has tax losses arising from the results of a foreign subsidiary of 1,830,000 2008: 1,185,000.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in a foreign subsidiary that may not make a profit in the immediate future.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings loss per share has been calculated on the following basis: 2009 2008 000 000 Profit loss after taxation attributable to ordinary equity holders 2,068 58,987 Basic weighted average ordinary shares in issue millions 506.2 498.9 Dilutive effect of share based instruments millions 9.5 Diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue millions 515.7 498.9 Basic earnings loss per ordinary share pence 0.4 11.8 Diluted earnings loss per ordinary share pence 0.4 11.8 62 Moneysupermarket.

During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.
This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for these assets.
Following the impairment provision in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other noncurrent assets of the Group.
At 31 December 2009 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets by 78%.
As disclosed in note 3, IFRS 8 has been adopted in the year with comparative disclosures made, and as a result revised operating segments are disclosed.
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units CGU that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8.
These CGUs are the four operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services, and the Group has therefore performed impairment testing at this level.
The goodwill has been allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with 30.7m allocated to Insurance, 15.5m to Money, 6.6m to Travel and 2.2m to Home Services.
For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2009, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2010.
The main assumptions underlying the 2010 budget relate to visitor numbers and revenue per transaction visitor.
The forecast assumes some improvement during the course of 2010 driven by the new branding campaign and investments made in the core technology for the Groups key channels, as well as the more settled outlook in the wider economy.
The Insurance and Money segments have been assumed to have similar rates of growth, and the Travel and Home Services segments have been assumed to return to close to the revenue levels achieved in 2008.
Cash flows for subsequent years for all segments are consistent with those in year 1 and assume no growth.
No reliable third party estimates of long term growth rates exist for the price comparison industry given it is a relatively new business model.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2009 Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued A pre-tax discount rate of 15% has been used in the forecast for all segments.
A lower discount rate has been used compared with the rate used to test the Internet segment last year 16% to reflect the reduction in the uncertainty in the economic climate since the start of the year.
When there are clear indications that the economy has begun to recover a different set of assumptions may be more appropriate.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money and Travel segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100% and the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Home Services segment exceeds their carrying value by 20%, and as such, are not impaired.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 3, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenues between the four operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment.
Therefore the cash flows estimated above include all of the Groups forecast revenues, but only approximately 55% of the Groups cost base.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with that in 2008.
In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows which has been calculated with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Groups assets exceeds their carrying value by 44m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, an increase of 3% in the discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would give a value in use for the Groups assets equal to their carrying value.
Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash flows of 6.0m, with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use for the Groups assets equal to their carrying value.
At an individual level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.
