Business review P06P53 Governance and remuneration P54P90 Financial statements P91P182 Shareholder information P183P204 107 Notes to the financial statements 6 Segment information GSK has implemented IFRS 8 Operating segments with effect from 1st January 2009 and this has resulted in a change to the segmental information reported by GSK.
Comparative information has been presented on a consistent basis.
GSKs operating segments are being reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Executive Officer and the responsibilities of the Corporate Executive Team CET.
Individual members of the CET are responsible for geographic regions of the Pharmaceuticals business and for the Consumer Healthcare business as a whole, respectively, before major restructuring.
R&D investment is essential for the sustainability of the pharmaceutical businesses.
However, for segment reporting, the USA, Europe, Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific Japan regional pharmaceutical operating profits exclude allocations of globally funded R&D as well as central costs, principally corporate functions and unallocated manufacturing costs.
GSKs management reporting process allocates all intra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.
The Other trading pharmaceuticals segment includes Canada, Puerto Rico, Stiefel, central vaccine tender sales and contract manufacturing sales.
The Stiefel business is being integrated into GSK and with effect from 1st January 2010, results will be reported within the relevant geographical pharmaceuticals segments, in line with the way in which the business will be managed.
GSK acquired the HIV business of Pfizer with effect from 30th October 2009 in return for a 15% minority stake in the combined HIV businesses, now called ViiV Healthcare Limited.
In line with the way the ViiV Healthcare business is to be managed, it will be reported as a separate segment from 1st January 2010.
For 2009, the GSK HIV business is reported within the relevant Pharmaceuticals segments: incremental income and costs since the creation of ViiV Healthcare have been reported within Other trading pharmaceuticals.
The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chairman, Research & Development and is therefore being reported as a separate segment.
Unallocated pharmaceuticals costs include costs such as vaccines R&D and central manufacturing costs not attributed to other segments.
Corporate and other unallocated costs and disposal profits include corporate functions, costs for legal matters, fair value movements on financial instruments and investments and unallocated profits on asset disposals.
