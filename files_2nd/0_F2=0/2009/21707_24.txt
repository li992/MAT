Financial Statements 67 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Change in accounting policy Each year the terms of the Group's deferred compensation scheme are evaluated and may be modified if deemed necessary.
Following each evaluation, management reassesses the extent to which the Group may exercise control over fund units held under the scheme.
Under the scheme arrangements, employees acquire a beneficial interest in these fund units while the legal interest is held by a nominee company on their behalf.
The Group may only acquire an interest in any units if they are forfeited by an employee, which requires some form of action by that employee.
Previously, the fund units were recognised as financial assets, fair valued through the profit and loss and expensed over the vesting period with a corresponding credit entry made to financial liabilities.
Both the financial assets and financial liabilities recognised under the scheme were fair valued at each Balance Sheet date, with any gains and losses being taken through the Income Statement within other operating income expense.
In the opinion of management, since the Group has no control over an employee's fund units except as a result of action by that employee, the accounting policy needed to be changed to recognise fund units purchased as prepayments rather than financial assets.
This represents an advance payment for services to be provided by the employee over the vesting period.
The prepayment is recorded at its cost on the date of purchase and released to the Income Statement over the vesting period.
As a result of this change, Income Statement volatility caused by the inconsistent measurement of fair value gains and losses on the Group's financial assets and liabilities is eliminated.
This change in accounting policy has been retrospectively applied, and the comparative statements for the year ended 30 June 2008 have been restated.
The effect of the change on the results for the years ended 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008 is tabulated below.
Opening reserves as at 30 June 2008 have been reduced by 153,000, which is the amount of the adjustment relating to periods prior to 30 June 2007.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders for the relevant period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence less the weighted average number of own shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with further adjustments to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive ordinary shares.
There are no differences between the profit for each financial year attributable to equity holders used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
The reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is given below: 2009 2008 Total Weighted Total Weighted number average number average thousands thousands thousands thousands Number of shares at 1 July 2008 and 1 July 2007 192,966 192,966 190,373 190,373 Issue of shares 803 364 2,593 1,267 Number of shares at 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008 193,769 193,330 192,966 191,640 Shares owned by employee trusts note 23 968 4,314 2,502 2,633 Shares held under Share Incentive plan 545 522 517 351 Shares held in nominee account under the Share award scheme note 21 iii 14,590 9,443 7,431 2,445 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 23 30,756 40,239 52,396 59,084 Basic number of shares 146,910 138,812 130,120 127,127 Shares owned by employee trusts note 23 968 4,314 2,502 2,633 Shares owned by Share Incentive plan 545 522 517 351 Shares held in nominee account under the Share award scheme note 21 iii 14,590 9,443 7,431 2,445 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 23 30,756 40,239 52,396 59,084 Employee share options 4,879 4,752 6,632 7,454 Dilutive number of shares 198,648 198,082 199,598 199,094 Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Group 000's 12,042 12,042 33,848 33,848 Financial Statements 73 10.

Financial risk management A qualitative analysis of the financial risks, which include credit, market and liquidity risks, facing the Group is provided in the Risk Management and Internal Control section to this Annual Report.
a Credit risk management Credit risk is the possibility that the Group may suffer a loss from the failure of one of our counterparties to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk in respect of amounts owed by related parties and segregated mandates and from cash deposits with banks.
i Counterparty credit rating and ageing according to the contractual due date Financial assets subject to credit risk are: 2009 2008 Note 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 17 62,270 44,253 Derivative financial instruments 16 303 Total excluding trade receivables 62,367 44,253 Amounts owed by related parties 15 21,119 23,452 Other trade receivables 15 5,144 4,803 Total trade receivables 26,263 28,255 Total 88,630 72,508 Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term bank deposits and cash in hand.
At 30 June 2009, 99% of cash is held with a counterparty that 1 is a major UK bank and is externally rated AA- 2008: 99%.
Amounts owed by related parties and other trade receivables relate to management and performance fees owed by funds and segregated mandates managed by the Group.
The ageing profile of amounts owed by these counterparties at the end of the period is as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s Not older than 30 days 23,844 27,665 Older than 30 days not older than 60 days 1,206 118 Older than 60 days not older than 90 days 1,213 445 Older than 90 days but not older than 120 days Older than 120 days but not older than 180 days 9 Older than 180 days 18 Total 26,263 28,255 Amounts not older than 30 days are neither past due nor impaired.
Amounts older than 30 days are past due but not impaired.
This represents 9% of the total fees outstanding 2008: 2%.
Factors considered in determining whether impairment has taken place include the deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty and knowledge of specific events that could influence a debtors ability to repay an amount due.
No impairments were recorded on items exposed to credit risk in either the current or comparative financial years.
The maximum credit exposure is equivalent to the carrying fair value of the balances shown.
ii Concentrations of credit risk The Groups largest counterparty exposure at the end of each period is as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s 1 AArated bank 61,467 43,870 1 Standard & Poors ratings The amount of these exposures can change significantly each month.
Financial Statements 75 b Market risk management i Investments in funds Under the deferred compensation scheme, the Group awards shares in a range of BlueBay investment funds to employees.
Awards made to employees are subject to forfeiture provisions.
Where shares have been forfeited note 14, they are held in one of the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts until the shares are either subsequently realised or used for future awards to employees.
At 30 June 2009 a 100 basis point strengthening weakening of the US Dollar against sterling, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a fair value adjustment of - 1,000, with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
At 30 June 2009 a 100 basis point strengthening weakening of the net asset valuation of the fund, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a fair value adjustment of - 1,000, with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
ii Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in the following currencies: Year ended 30 June 2009: Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial assets Note 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 17 55,519 3,431 3,124 149 47 62,270 Current financial assets 14 122 122 Trade receivables 15 229 9,337 15,697 1,000 26,263 Derivative financial instruments 16 382 685 303 Total financial assets 55,748 12,508 19,506 149 1,047 88,958 Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Trade and other payables due within one year 4,525 1,561 7,271 74 13,368 Total financial liabilities 4,525 1,561 7,271 74 13,368 Year ended 30 June 2008: Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial assets Restated Note 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 17 41,310 1,635 1,118 182 8 44,253 Trade receivables 15 16,372 11,662 221 28,255 Total financial assets 41,310 18,007 12,780 182 229 72,508 Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Trade and other payables due within one year 4,869 793 2,610 6 8,278 Total financial liabilities 4,869 793 2,610 6 8,278 Financial liabilities comprise current trade payables and accruals.
They do not include provisions which are explicitly excluded from the definition of a financial instrument under IFRS 7.
Financial assets as at 30 June 2008 have been restated due to the change in accounting policy note 1.
The Groups revenue is received in US dollars and Euros.
From time to time, the Group may put in place short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge these future receivables.
At 30 June 2009 a 100 basis point strengthening weakening of the US Dollar and Euro against sterling, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an additional foreign exchange loss gain of - 250,000, with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
Interest rate risk is the risk arising from unexpected or untoward movements in interest rates.
The Groups monetary assets earn interest at 20 basis points below the base rate.
As the Group does not have any debt financing, it is not exposed to interest rate risk.
Management believes that movements in interest rates will not result in any significant risk to the Group.
76 BlueBay Asset Management plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 11.
Financial risk management continued c Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances.
i Financial assets and liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are all due within one year.
2009 2008 Note 000s 000s Financial assets Restated Cash and cash equivalents 17 62,270 44,253 Current financial assets 14 122 Trade receivables 15 26,263 28,255 Derivative financial instruments 16 303 Total financial assets 88,958 72,508 2009 2008 Financial liabilities 000s 000s Trade and other payables 13,368 8,278 The Groups total financial assets exceed its total financial liabilities in the ratio of 6.7: 1 2008: 8.8:1. ii Commitments a Operating leases The Group leases office premises and computer software under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed as contractual undiscounted cash flows are as follows: 2009 2008 Leasehold Leasehold property property 000s 000s Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases expiring: Within one year 4,861 4,695 Later than one year and less than five years 19,326 18,755 After five years 33,032 37,612 Total 57,219 61,062 A provision of 2,277,000 has been made against surplus premises in respect of the New York office note 19.

Financial Statements 77 d Capital Management The Group uses its capital primarily to support the growth of the business and to provide it with a cushion to shield it from adverse market conditions.
In order to determine its primary capital requirements, the Group uses multi-year financial models to determine the capital requirements of its anticipated growth.
The Group develops a number of potential adverse scenarios in order to determine their effect on various financial measures, including the Groups capital base.
This enables the Group to determine the amount of capital that should be retained in the business for prudential purposes.
Once this primary objective has been met, the Group uses available distributable reserves for purposes such as paying dividends to shareholders, funding the equity incentivisation programme and providing seed capital for new funds, if required.
From time to time the Group has provided financing to the EBT and its SIP to enable them to purchase BlueBays shares in the market.
The timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
The shares are intended to be used for awarding shares to employees under the Groups sharebased incentive schemes.
There is no specific buy back plan.
The Group also manages its capital requirements in line with the regulatory capital limits set by the Financial Services Authority.
The Group believes that the changes made to its accounting policy in respect of its deferred compensation scheme, as described in note 1 do not result in any breaches in regulatory capital limits in the current or previous years.
The Group has been in compliance with the regulatory capital requirements at all times during the year.

The fair values of the investments in funds are determined by using the net asset values of the funds at the Balance Sheet date.
The investments held relate to forfeited fund units under the Groups deferred compensation scheme which is discussed in more detail in note 6.
Where shares have been forfeited under the scheme, they are held in one of the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts until such shares are either subsequently realised or used for future awards to employees.
Disposals relate to shares which have been realised.

The provision has been made taking into account residual lease commitments, other outgoings and sub-letting lease surrender arrangements.
In arriving at the provision, the cash flows have been discounted at rates representing an estimate of the interest rates relevant to the period of provision.
The weighted average of these rates is 2%.
It is envisaged that the provision will be utilised on an even basis until 2015 in line with the remaining lease term.
The calculation of the surplus premises provision involves two principal assumptions: an estimation of the time value of money to the Group, and the mitigating effects of sub-letting income receivable.
Cash inflows and outflows are predominantly contractually agreed fixed amounts.
The effect on the provision of an increase decrease of 1%.
in the discount rate used in the calculation would be 110,000.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of surplus space provisions to the methods and assumptions used in their estimation is therefore not considered to be significant.

Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using an effective tax rate of 28% 2008: 28%.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where the tax deduction in the current year has exceeded the current taxable profits.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on the probability that the Group will derive taxable profits in the future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.

Share-based payments The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by management and employees, principally through various equity settled, share-based compensation schemes.
Details of these schemes can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 49 to these Financial Statements and are summarised in the notes below.
The fair value of the employee services rendered in exchange for the share awards and options granted previously under these schemes is recognised as an expense through the Income Statement.
The expense is based on the fair value of the share-based payment transactions on grant date, spread over the vesting period.
During the year, the following expense was charged to the Income Statement in respect of equity-settled, share-based transactions: 2009 2008 000s 000s EMI Scheme i Unapproved option award scheme ii 76 156 Share award scheme iii 9,920 4,120 SIP Scheme iv 279 556 Total 10,275 4,832 Of the total charges of 10,275,000 2008: 4,832,000, 1,070,000 2008: nil of share award scheme charges are shown within exceptional items in the Income Statement as they relate to accelerated charges with respect to good leavers note 4. i Enterprise Management Incentive EMI Option Award Scheme The Group issued share options through its EMI scheme in December 2005.
A total of 20,700,000 options under this scheme were exercised when the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange on 22 November 2006.
As a condition of exercise, the Company required the holders of the EMI options to enter into an agreement not to sell their resulting shares for a period of up to four years following Listing although 25% of these ordinary shares became available for sale on each anniversary of the date of exercise of the EMI options.
As at 30 June 2009, selling restrictions on 50% of the shares held by employees had been lifted.
The scheme is no longer operative and there are no options outstanding under this scheme.
During the year, the movement in respect of restricted ordinary shares issued under the scheme was as follows: 2009 2008 Number Number Note of shares of shares Balance at 1 July 15,387,500 20,675,000 Shares sold on open market 274,016 5,964 Shares vested unconditionally 5,075,000 5,162,500 Shares forfeited to Group Employee Benefit Trust 23 950,984 119,036 Restricted shares unsold at 30 June 9,087,500 15,387,500 ii Unapproved Option Award Scheme The Group operated a second option award scheme, not approved by HMRC, where selected employees were eligible to participate.
All grants under this scheme were made in 2006, prior to Listing and there have been no new awards during the year.
In general terms, providing an optionholder remains an employee of the Group, options may be exercised in accordance with a vesting schedule as follows: 25% on or after each of 30 January 2007, 30 January 2008, 30 January 2009 and 30 January 2010.
All Unapproved options expire on the business date preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.

Shares awarded during the current and previous financial year vest unconditionally with employees over a period of four to five years after the grant date with either 25% of the shares vesting on each anniversary of the date of award, commencing two years after the grant date or 100% of the shares vesting on the third anniversary after the grant date.
Shares are held in a nominee account on behalf of each employee until such shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
In respect of good leavers, shares continue to follow the original vesting schedule although forfeiture provisions are lifted so that such shares are no longer restricted.
The fair value of the shares is measured on the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
The fair value of the shares granted is taken to be the market price at the date of award.
The amount recognised in the Income Statement is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual number of shares that vest.
