The disposal generated a cash inflow of 57 million: an outflow is anticipated in the forthcoming year of approximately 29 million.
A number of other investments relating to the International Sugar Trading business were not included in the initial sale and are being addressed separately in accordance with the relevant shareholders agreements.
