RIGHT TO STOP SENDING DIVIDEND WARRANTS, NOTICES ETC Article 178 has been inserted to grant the Company the right to: a stop sending dividend cheques or warrants in certain circumstances namely where they have been returned, undelivered or left uncashed for two consecutive occasions during the periods which they are valid and reasonable enquiries have been made to establish any new address for the relevant member or person: and b stop sending members and all people granted information rights by virtue of the 2006 Act, notices etc, if they have been returned undelivered on at least two consecutive occasions or if following one such occasion reasonable enquiries have failed to establish a new address for service, subject to the passing of a Directors resolution confirming that the Company need not send such documents to the said member person granted information rights.
INDEMNITY The new Articles permit the Directors but not the Auditors to be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by the 2006 Act not only in relation to the affairs of the Company but also in relation to the affairs of any subsidiary or subsidiary undertaking of the Company.
NOMINATION RIGHTS Articles are to be inserted to reflect the statutory framework within the 2006 Act by which indirect investors who hold their shares through intermediaries may exercise certain membership rights if the Companys Articles allow it.
It should be noted that members of a listed company are able to nominate another person to receive information to which they are entitled.
Even if the Company does not want a member to have the right to nominate someone to exercise all of the available rights, the Articles should still be amended to provide for members to nominate someone to receive information to which they are entitled.
This should cover: the rights which a nominee may enjoy: the situations in which a persons nomination rights will terminate and the form and content of nomination notices: and when nomination notices take effect and how the Company must deal with them.
