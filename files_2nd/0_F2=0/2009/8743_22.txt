As a result, a one-off depreciation adjustment of 9,288,000 was taken in property, plant and equipment, following a review, by management, in respect of certain assets which were not being depreciated in line with the Companys accounting policy.
At the same time, management has reclassified certain assets and certain accumulated depreciation to the correct statutory headings within property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-current assets.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Company considers each trading outlet to be a separate CGU, with each CGU reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Company estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, based on future trading performance expected by management.
There is a significant number of interconnected assumptions which underpin the value-in-use calculations.
However, the underlying basis for the impairment model involves each CGUs projected cash flow for the financial year ending 25 July 2010, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions in respect of sales growth, gross margin and cost-savings for that specific CGU.
In establishing the value of the CGUs future cash flows, the board has approved a set of overall projections which it considers to be prudent.
The discount rate employed by the Company this year of 10.0% 2008: 6.9% reflects a move away from the Companys weighted-average cost of capital before tax to a different discount rate which is more reflective of the current economic climate and the industry as a whole.
The board has approved the discount rate which is applicable to all CGUs and believes the rate to be prudent.
As a result of this exercise, impairment losses in 2009 were 6,527,000 2008: nil.
Management believes that no reasonable change in any of the key assumptions: for example, the discount rate applied to each CGU would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
