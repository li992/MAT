the consolidated Financial statements for the financial year ended 29 august 2009 and 30 august 2008 have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
the preparation of the Financial statements, in conformity with iFRs, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates see note 6.
2 Accounting Policies the Groups principal accounting policies are described below.
Consolidation the Financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
subsidiaries include all entities including special purpose entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control.
they are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
on consolidation, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
accounting policies of the company and its subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession sales are recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card.
Department store customer special orders and internet sales are recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer.
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group are recognised on the redemption of the gift card or gift voucher.
it is the Groups policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return.
accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Interest Recognition interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
60 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 2 Accounting Policies continued Dividend Distribution a final dividend distribution to the company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the company and Groups Financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company shareholders.
interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Retirement benefit Costs the liability or asset recognised in respect of dened benefit schemes is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the dened obligation at the balance sheet date.
the dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
the present value of the dened benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
they are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of Recognised income and expenses.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
in this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
the Group operates a dened contribution scheme in ireland and a stakeholder scheme in the UK.
contributions to these pension schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance sheet.
Share-Based Payments the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
a fair value for the equity-settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
the Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each class of award, a Black-scholes, monte carlo or Binomial pricing model.
the fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
at each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
it recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital at nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Exceptional Items exceptional items are events or transactions which, by virtue of their size or nature, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the Financial statements.
Foreign Exchange a Functional and Presentational Currency items included in the Financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
the consolidated Financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentational currency.
b Group Companies the results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction : and resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
c Transactions and Balances transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on exchange are taken to the income statement.
61 Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued For the financial year ended 29 august 2009 2 Accounting Policies continued Taxation taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that are in force during the period.
taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
if deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leased Assets a Finance Leases leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classied as finance leases.
Finance leases are classied as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the period of the lease.
the resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b Operating Leases all other leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed xed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Intangible Assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised, but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units which are split on a regional basis for the purpose of impairment testing.
b Other Intangible Assets acquired licences and trademarks are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, not to exceed ten years.
internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
the software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, being three to eight years.
62 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 2 Accounting Policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment it is the Groups policy to hold properties at cost less accumulated depreciation, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1 per cent long leasehold land and buildings including landlords xtures and ttings 1 per cent or life of lease if shorter short leasehold land and buildings including landlords xtures and ttings life of lease Retail xtures and ttings 420 per cent ofce equipment 1012.5 per cent 1 computer equipment 1433 3 per cent Vehicles 25 per cent or life of lease the assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
these are included in the income statement.
included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
these assets comprise stores, which are under construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
Impairment Testing assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash generating units.
Available-for-Sale Investments the Group classifies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with ias 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
available-for-sale financial investments are non-derivative assets.
they are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
investments are recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs.
the fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the reporting date.
an impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
concession inventories are not included within inventories held by the Group.
Trade Receivables trade receivables, dened as loans and receivables in accordance with ias 39, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method for any doubtful amounts.
a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
the amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash ows discounted at the effective interest rate.
the movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
63 Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued For the financial year ended 29 august 2009 2 Accounting Policies continued Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs that are facility costs, are recognised initially at fair value, and are amortised over the term of the facilities at a constant rate on the committed amount of each facility.
Debt Repurchase the nominal value of debt repurchased has been accounted for as a loan redemption, reducing net borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Trade Payables trade payables, dened as financial liabilities in accordance with ias 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
all of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and, where it is more likely than not an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Share Capital ordinary shares are classied as equity.
incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Derivatives the derivative instruments used by the Group to manage its interest rate and currency risk are interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
the method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
the Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedges.
Derivatives are recognised using trade date accounting.
at the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
the Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ows of hedged items.
i Cash Flow Hedges the effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the income statement which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
amounts accumulated in equity are recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance sheet or in the income statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is immediately recognised in the relevant line of the income statement which will be affected by the original underlying hedged item.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the relevant line of the income statement, which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
64 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 2 Accounting Policies continued ii Derivatives That Do Not Qualify For Hedge Accounting certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
iii Embedded Derivatives Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the contracts, and the whole contract is not carried at fair value with gains or losses reported in the income statement, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reected in the account in the income statement which will be affected by the underlying host contract.
New Standards and Interpretations During the year the Group adopted iFRic 13 customer loyalty programmes.
the adoption of this iFRic has not had any impact on the prior year Balance sheet or income statement.
During the year, the international accounting standards Board iasB and international Financial Reporting interpretations committee iFRic issued the following standards and interpretations which are effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date.
these standards and interpretations are not effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of these Financial statements: effective date International Accounting Standards IFRS IAS iFRs 8 operating segments January 2009 ias 1 revised Presentation of financial statements January 2009 ias 23 2007 Borrowing costs January 2009 ias 27 revised consolidated and separate financial statements July 2009 amendment to ias 32 Financial instruments: Presentation January 2009 amendment to ias 39 eligible hedged items July 2009 iFRs 2 share-based payments amendment to vesting conditions and cancellations January 2009 iFRs 2 share-based payments Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions January 2010 iFRs 3 revised Business combinations July 2009 amendment to iFRs 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures January 2009 annual improvements to iFRs 2007 January 2009 IFRIC Interpretations iFRic 12 service concession arrangements march 2009 iFRic 14 ias 19 the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction January 2009 iFRic 15 agreements for the construction of real estate January 2009 iFRic 16 hedges in a net investment in a foreign operation July 2009 iFRic 17 Distributions of non-cash assets to owners July 2009 iFRic 18 transfers of assets from customers July 2009 iFRic 17, iFRic 18 and the amendment to iFRs 7 have not yet been adopted by the european Union.
the Group is currently considering the implications of the adoption of these standards and interpretations.
they are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial statements.
65 Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued For the financial year ended 29 august 2009 3 Financial Risk Management a Financial Risks and Treasury Management the board has established an overall treasury policy and has approved policies, procedures and authority levels within which the treasury function Group treasury must operate.
the Finance Director conducts treasury reviews at least monthly and the board receive regular monthly reports covering treasury activity.
the treasury committee meets and reviews the report on a quarterly basis.
Group treasury manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
the Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, trade receivables and trade payables.
the main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups nancing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
the derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
the Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: funding and liquidity risk: credit risk: foreign exchange risk: and cash ow interest rate risk.
the Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
the policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and Liquidity Risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group treasury aims to maintain exibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
the Group nances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
the objective is to ensure that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash ow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
short-term requirements can be nanced by the 250.0 million Revolving credit Facility RcF, which expires in april 2011, of which nil 2008: 45 million was utilised at the balance sheet date.
ii Credit Risk credit risk is the risk where the Group can suffer financial loss through default by customers or financial institutions.
the Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with financial counterparties with a short-term credit rating of a1, P1 or better as assigned by either standard and Poors or moodys respectively.
the carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements net of any allowances for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
iii Foreign Exchange Risk the Groups functional currency is sterling.
the Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Us dollar and also to the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions relating to imports and trading in the Republic of ireland.
to manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Grouptreasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Grouptreasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of 18 months or less.
Up to 100 per cent of the first three months forecast purchases, up to 80 per cent of the next three months and up to 70 per cent for the following 12 months forecast purchases are hedged.
the Group does not hedge economic exposure and reviews the need to hedge translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling business.
Due to the volatility of the sterling and the euro exchange rate during the year, the Group hedged the indebtedness between the UK and its irish subsidiary.
66 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 3 Financial Risk Management continued iv Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk the Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
the Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
the interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
the aim is to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the exibility to minimise early termination costs.
the Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target xed percentage of 75 per cent, with a 15 per cent tolerance 6090 per cent.
the impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of oating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
these are usually matched with specic loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
the Groups main interest rate exposure is from the oating rate loans under the credit facilities.
at the year end, following the capital raising on 23 June 2009, the Groups hedged xed rate borrowings amounted to 727.5 million, being 93 per cent of the Groups total borrowings.
the Group is currently reviewing its interest rate swap portfolio.
v Other Price Risk the Group is exposed to equity risk arising from equity investments.
the sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
at the year end, if the valuations had been 10 per cent higher lower when all other variables were held constant: net profit would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classied as available-for-sale investments: other reserves would decrease increase by 0.4 million 2008: 0.6 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments.
b Capital Management the Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may consider: the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
c Fair Value Estimates the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
the fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
the fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
in the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities to their fair values at the year end.
4 Segmental Reporting Based on an analysis of risks and returns, the directors consider that the Group has only one identiable business segment, retailing.
all material operations of the Group are carried out in the British isles and therefore no geographical segmentation is disclosed.
the Group operates both an internet and an international division, both of which remain immaterial for the purposes of segmental reporting.
consequently, the Group has considered business segmentation as the primary segmentation, with a single separately reportable segment, retailing.
67 Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued For the financial year ended 29 august 2009 5 Gross TransactionValue Revenue from concessions is required to be shown on a net basis, being the commission received rather than the gross value achieved by the concessionaire on the sale.
management believes that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide to the value of the overall activity of the Group.
29 August 30 august 2009 2008 m m Gross transaction value 2,339.7 2,336.0 6 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements the Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
the resulting accounting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Estimated Impairment of Goodwill the Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2. the recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
the method requires an estimate of future cash ows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash ows.
Taxation and Deferred Taxation the Group is subject to income taxes in the UK and the Republic of ireland.
at each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
the Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
significant judgement is also required in determining the deferred tax on developers contributions, fair value losses and gains, retirement benefit assets and liabilities and other provisions.
the Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of the above matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
the final outcome of some of these tax items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash ow movements.
the fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
the fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
the key assumptions of this model are set out in note 27.
Pension Liabilities the Groups dened benefit schemes pension liabilities, which are assessed each period by actuaries, are based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, ination, future salary and pension costs.
these assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions: additional information relating to this is disclosed in note 23.
Estimated Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment the Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each financial period end.
the Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs.
68 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 7 Operating profit 29 August 30 august 2009 2008 m m The following items have been included in arriving at operating profit: the amounts of inventory written down during the financial year 10.2 16.5 cost of inventories recognised as an expense 983.6 914.5 employment costs note 8 321.2 307.5 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment note 15 : owned assets 87.2 86.2 assets held under finance leases 0.7 1.3 accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment note 15 : owned assets 0.1 0.8 amortisation of intangible assets note 14 8.1 7.5 loss profit on disposal of: Property, plant and equipment 0.2 3.1 operating lease rentals: Property 167.1 157.3 other 0.9 1.4 Foreign exchange gains 3.4 8.0 Repairs and maintenance expenditure on property, plant and equipment 10.5 13.2 auditors remuneration 1.0 0.4 Operating Lease Costs and Incentives the amount charged to the income statement in respect of operating lease costs and incentives for the Group has changed signicantly under iFRs.
the adverse impact on reported profit relating to the treatment of leases with annual xed increments in rent and the accounting for both rent free periods and developers contributions is as follows: 29 August 30 august 2009 2008 m m leases with fixed annual increments in rent 13.1 13.5 Rent free periods 1.6 1.4 Developers contributions 9.5 7.7 Reduction in operating profit resulting from accounting in accordance with IAS 17 Leases and SIC 15 Operating leasesincentives 24.2 22.6 Services Provided by the Companys Auditor and Network Firms During the year the Group obtained the following services from the companys auditor as detailed below: 29 August 30 august 2009 2008 m m Audit services Fees payable to the companys auditor for the audit of the parent company and consolidated accounts 0.2 0.2 the audit of the companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 0.1 0.1 Other services Fees payable to the companys auditor and its associates for other services tax advisory services 0.1 0.1 other assurance services 0.6 included with other assurance services is 46,000 2008: 24,000 relating to the dened benefit pension scheme audits.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
the Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year.

Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of cash-Generating Units cGUs split on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
this allocation was primarily undertaken subsequent to the acquisition in December 2003 of the Debenhams stores by Debenhams plc.
the cGUs are set out below: south south North midlands east West south other total m m m m m m m Goodwill 159.3 184.3 180.1 185.3 102.8 7.4 819.2 For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the cGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
these cash ow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
the key assumptions used in these projections are sales growth and discount rates.
the projections also assume that the change in sales mix from concessions to own bought stock will result in improved gross margins.
the five-year plan is built up using managements previous experience and incorporates managements view of current economic conditions and trading expectations.
cash ows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of no growth after year five.
the growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the cGUs operate.
the pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 8.0 per cent 2008: 7.3 per cent and reects the specic risks in the retail business.
management determined the gross margin for each cGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the market development.
the weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
the discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates.
Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom on a region-by-region basis, and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would not cause an impairment write down to goodwill.
as a result of the impairment review, as at 29 august 2009, no impairment of goodwill has been required 2008: nil.

Derivatives are used to hedge the exposure to market risks.
Derivatives that are held for hedging are designated as cash ow hedged instruments in accordance with ias 39. the derivatives held for hedging are described below.
there is no material impact in the income statement resulting from ineffective hedges.
i Forward Foreign Currency Contracts the net fair value losses at 29 august 2009 on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk of anticipated future inventory purchases are 1.6 million 2008: gains of 9.8 million.
this will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next 18 months.
Forward exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges are reclassied to assets held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is crystallised on the Balance sheet as inventory.
During the year there were no contracts reclassied to assets held for trading due to cash ow hedges being ineffective.
ii Interest Rate Swaps the Groups interest rate swaps switch interest from oating rates to xed rates.

interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classied as held for trading.
changes in the fair value of any instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement within interest payable and other costs.

Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on liBoR.
cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on liBiD or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.

80 Section 4 Financial statements and Notes Debenhams annual Report and accounts 2009 22 Financial Instruments continued Sensitivity Analysis the Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
the range of changes chosen, being 1 per cent movement in the interest rate or 5 per cent movement in sterling when compared to Us dollar, reects the Groups view of potential changes to these risk variables which existed at the year end.
the table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.

an award under the PsP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment is required for the grant of an award.
an award under the PsP will comprise an option to receive free shares or nil cost options with performance conditions attached.
awards under the scheme have been made since may 2006. the vesting on half of the shares granted is dependent on earnings Per share ePs growth.
in accordance with iFRs 2 share-based Payments this is classied as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value.
the vesting of the remaining half of the shares is dependent upon total shareholder Return tsR over a three year period when compared to total shareholder return of the Ftse 350 General Retailers index.
the fair value of the PsP options granted for this proportion of the award is calculated based on a monte carlo simulation model assuming the inputs shown below: Grant date 7 may 08 29 may 07 24 Nov 06 Number of shares under option number 3,410,092 2,816,895 1,896,500 expected term years 3.0 3.0 3.0 share price at grant pence 65.0 137.5 198.3 exercise price pence Risk free rate 5.7% 6.0% 5.5% expected volatility 34.0% 21.0% 21.0% expected dividend yield 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Fair value of option pence : tsR 29.0 64.3 95.2 ePs 59.0 121.0 178.0 Volatility has been estimated by taking the historic volatility in the companys share price.
During the year 210,723 2008: 5,405,023 options were granted under the plan following the rm placing and placing and open offer in order to maintain an equivalent number of options.
consequently this grant does not change the fair value of each option.
in accordance with the plan rules, options issued in may 2006 and June 2006 have lapsed during the year as neither the ePs nor thetsR performance conditions were met.
in addition, the February 2008 options were forfeited.
ii Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP the esoP allows the company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
these options will normally become exercisable following a three year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.
the vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on ePs growth and the fair value of the share options has been calculated using a binomial model.
the key assumptions are as follows: Grant date 12 Nov 07 29 may 07 24 Nov 06 Number of shares under option number 1,518,082 334,447 1,328,058 expected term years 6.0 6.0 6.0 share price at grant pence 103.0 137.5 198.3 exercise price pence 103.0 137.5 198.3 Risk free rate 5.8% 6.0% 5.5% expected volatility 32.0% 24.0% 24.0% expected dividend yield 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Fair value of option pence 30.0 31.7 44.8 During the year 80,265 2008: 2,332,733 options were granted under the plan following the rm placing and placing and open offer in order to maintain an equivalent number of options.
in accordance with the plan rules, options issued in may 2006 and June 2006 have lapsed as the performance conditions associated with these options were not met.
the weighted average exercise price of the esoP at 29 august 2009 was 146.4 pence 2008: 159.1 pence.
