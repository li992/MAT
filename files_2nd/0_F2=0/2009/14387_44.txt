96 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the accounts continued 10 Post-retirement benefits Smiths operates a number of defined benefit plans throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and in the United States and assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The Group also provides a defined contribution 401K plan for its US employees.
The US defined benefit pension plan was closed with effect from 30 April 2009, from which date no further benefits have accrued.
In addition, future benefits accruing under the US and UK post-retirement healthcare schemes were substantially reduced: for most members the company will contribute 50% of the 2009 premium and the member will pay the remainder of the premium.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent,  actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2006.
The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2008.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2009.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2009 2008 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries 3.8% n a 3.1% 4.1% 3.8% 3.7% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3% n a 1.4% 3.6% n a 1.4% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.3% n a 0.6% 3.5% n a 0.7% Discount rate 5.9% 6.0% 5.9% 6.6% 6.8% 6.0% Inflation rate 3.3% n a 1.7% 3.6% 3.3% 2.5% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% n a 3.0% 5.0% 3.8% 8% p. a. reducing 0.5% p. a. to 5% in 2014 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA these are disclosed as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the new SAPS All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on recent actual mortality experience of members within each.
They allow for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 80% and 60% of the long cohort for males and females respectively with an annual 1% underpin.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the most recent mortality study table produced for retired pensioners in the US RP 2000 table.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.
The assumptions give the following: Expected further years of life UK US Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 22 24 19 21 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 24 25 19 21 The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2009 were: 2009 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 8.2% 1,113.1 8.8% 198.6 9.3% 7.8 1,319.5 Government bonds 4.5% 242.5 4.3% 68.5 4.6% 3.5 314.5 Corporate bonds 5.9% 267.1 6.0% 44.2 7.7% 2.5 313.8 Insured liabilities 5.9% 490.1 6.0% 1.8 n a 491.9 Property 7.2% 137.8 n a 2.9% 0.2 138.0 Other 5.0% 163.1 3.0% 21.4 5.0% 12.9 197.4 Total market value 2,413.7 334.5 26.9 2,775.1 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 2,531.8 462.6 33.2 3,027.6 Deficit 118.1 128.1 6.3 252.5 Unfunded pension plans 36.0 4.9 18.7 59.6 Post-retirement healthcare 6.2 18.0 0.7 24.9 Present value of unfunded obligations 42.2 22.9 19.4 84.5 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 2.0 2.0 Net pension liability 160.3 151.0 27.7 339.0 Post-retirement assets 39.2 39.2 Post-retirement liabilities 199.5 151.0 27.7 378.2 Net pension liability 160.3 151.0 27.7 339.0 97 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 10 Post-retirement benefits continued 2008 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 8.2% 1,165.8 8.8% 187.5 8.8% 7.1 1,360.4 Government bonds 4.8% 445.1 5.3% 83.8 6.6% 4.9 533.8 Corporate bonds 6.6% 258.4 6.8% 25.8 7.1% 1.8 286.0 Insured liabilities 6.6% 271.4 6.8% 1.5 n a 272.9 Property 7.2% 188.7 n a 3.2% 0.2 188.9 Other 5.8% 289.0 6.0% 17.9 5.0% 11.0 317.9 Total market value 2,618.4 316.5 25.0 2,959.9 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 2,468.8 357.0 30.7 2,856.5 Surplus deficit 149.6 40.5 5.7 103.4 Unfunded pension plans 34.3 3.7 16.4 54.4 Post-retirement healthcare 15.2 42.0 0.8 58.0 Present value of unfunded obligations 49.5 45.7 17.2 112.4 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 1.5 1.5 Net pension asset liability 100.1 86.2 24.4 10.5 Post-retirement assets 174.2 174.2 Post-retirement liabilities 74.1 86.2 24.4 184.7 Net pension asset liability 100.1 86.2 24.4 10.5 Other assets in the UK and US comprise cash and current assets.
During 2009 the Trustees of the TI Pension Scheme invested 249.3m 2008: 250.0m in annuities which are matched with specific liabilities of the scheme.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

Sensitivity Valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2009 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of thelistedassumptions inisolation, with theexception of thesensitivityto inflation which incorporates theimpact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.
