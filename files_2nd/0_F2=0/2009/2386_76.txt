BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes on financial statements 22.
Investments in jointly controlled entities The significant jointly controlled entities of the BP group at 31 December 2009 are shown in Note 43.
Summarized financial information for the groups share of jointly controlled entities is shown below.
The formerly evenly-balanced main board structure has been replaced by one with four representatives each from BP and AAR, plus three independent directors.
The change in accounting classification from a jointly controlled entity to an associate reflected the ability of the independent directors of TNK-BP to decide on certain matters in the event of disagreement between the shareholder representatives on the board.
The group's investment continues to be accounted for using the equity method.
In December 2007, BP signed a memorandum of understanding with Husky Energy Inc. Husky to form an integrated North American oil sands business.
The transaction was completed on 31 March 2008, with BP contributing its Toledo refinery to a US jointly controlled entity to which Husky contributed $250 million cash and a payable of $2,588 million.
In Canada, Husky contributed its Sunrise field to a second jointly controlled entity, with BP contributing $250 million in cash and a payable of $2,264 million.
Both jointly controlled entities are owned 50:50 by BP and Husky and are accounted for using the equity method.
Transactions between the group and its jointly controlled entities are summarized below.
