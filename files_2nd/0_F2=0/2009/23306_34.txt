THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 27 Auditors Resolutions proposing the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as the Companys Auditors and authorising the Directors to determine their remuneration will be put to the forthcoming AGM.
Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors consider this is the appropriate basis as the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In considering this, the Directors took into account the diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be used to meet funding commitments, and the ability of the Company to meet all of its liabilities and ongoing expenses from its assets.
