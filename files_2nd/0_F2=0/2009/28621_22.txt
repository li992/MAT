Notes to the individual accounts 34 Signi cant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modi ed by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and law.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by FRS 29 not to present the disclosures required by that standard relating to financial risks in the Companys solus accounts.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Impairment Tangible xed assets are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11: Impairment of xed assets and goodwill.
The carrying values of tangible xed assets are written down by the amount of any permanent impairment and the loss is charged as an operating cost to the pro t and loss account in the period in which this occurs.
The carrying value of tangible xed assets may be written up to a value no higher than the original depreciated cost, should an external event reverse the effects of a previous impairment.
At each balance sheet date the Company reviews the carrying amount of its financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
Where there is objective evidence that an available for sale security is impaired the cumulative loss that has been recognised in reserves is removed from reserves and recognised in the pro t and loss account.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in equity instruments classi ed as available for sale is not reversed through pro t or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classi ed as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the pro t and loss account, the impairment is reversed through the pro t and loss account.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions for impairment.
Available for sale equity securities Available for sale investments are those intended to be held for an inde nite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Equity investments are initially recognised at fair value.
For unlisted securities, the Company establishes fair value by using valuation techniques, including the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash ow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ows from the financial assets have expired or been effectively transferred, or where the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Equity investments are subsequently carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised directly in equity except for changes arising from uctuations in foreign exchange rates, which are recognised as income or expenditure in the pro t and loss account for monetary assets and directly in equity for non-monetary assets, until the financial asset is derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity should be recognised in pro t or loss.
109 Notes to the individual accounts Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 34 Signi cant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Companys equity-settled share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options and share awards in relation to the Companys Share Incentive Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan granted to employees after 7 November 2002 and not vested as at 1 January 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re ect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
For cash settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At the date on which the liability is settled, and at each balance sheet date between grant date and settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in pro t or loss for the year.
The cost of share-based payments relating to subsidiaries directors and staff are recharged to the subsidiaries.
Pension liability The Company operates pension schemes providing bene ts based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company.
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The pension scheme surplus to the extent that it is recoverable or fide cit is recognised in full, net of any related deferred tax asset or liability.
The movement in the scheme surplus fide cit is split between operating charges, finance items and actuarial gains and losses.
Payments to fide ned contribution retirement bene t schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Deferred taxation Full provision, without discounting, is made for deferred taxation arising from timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except where otherwise required by accounting standards.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is more certain than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiaries, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing borrowings Immediately after issue debt is stated at the fair value of consideration received, after deduction of issue costs.
The finance cost of the debt is allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
