SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Groups primary format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
Primary Reporting Format Business Segments The Group is organised into three main businesses: Managed Services: undertaking outsourced programmes for central and local Government and other commercial organisations: Installation Services: installation of energy efficient improvements, along with central heating installation and related services in homes across the UK: and Specialist Support Services: providing a range of solutions which support the customers we serve in other segments.
These include aftercare and insurance services, wholesale insulation, on-line retail of energy efficient white goods, sale to utility companies of energy savings accredited to energy efficient measures installed and overseas activities.
Eliminations represent the elimination of inter-segment sales.
Transfer pricing between business segments is set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Revenue, costs, assets and liabilities have been allocated between segments firstly on those items specific to the segment: any remaining items have been allocated using a reasonable basis such as revenue.
Certain costs have not been allocated as identified below.

The awards vested 50% on the first anniversary of admission and 50% on the second anniversary of admission to the London Stock Exchange.
iii Management Incentive Plan MIP The MIP provides for the grant of nil cost options.
The awards were granted to certain Partners on 14 October 2008.
The vesting period is three years of which 50% is dependent upon the level of increase in earnings per share over the vesting period, and the remaining 50% is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group compared to the FTSE mid 250 index over the vesting period.

The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for all schemes other than the MIP, which has been calculated by applying a Monte Carlo pricing model.
As all share options have been granted at nil cost, the assumptions used in the models that impact on valuation are as follows: Share price Price at date of grant Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historical dividend yield Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2,055,000 2008: 2,649,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
7. ePT-FUNDED CHARGES Year ended Year ended 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 ePT-funded Share Incentive Plan 1,559 The Group operates a SIP under which qualifying Partners may receive free shares.
ePT waived its interim and final dividends for the year ended 31 May 2008 amounting to 2.8m 2008: Nil.
These funds have been used to finance initial awards under the SIP.
This funding was utilised by the SIP trustee in October 2008 to acquire a number of shares in the Company to be held in order to meet the future commitment of the SIP.
Further details of the share purchases are set out in note 28.
The SIP has no commitment to make any awards to Partners in excess of those funded to date by ePT.
Because this expense has been fully funded by ePT, there is no material net impact on the Groups reserves over the contractual life of the plan, cash or net assets against that which would have occurred had ePT not waived its dividends.
Accordingly, the associated share-based payment charge incurred by the Company has been separately disclosed on the face of the income statement and excluded from EBITA.

GOODWILL 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 Cost As at 1 June 57,379 38,483 Acquisitions note 30 1,970 19,461 Exchange differences 112 69 Reassessment of consideration payable 634 As at 31 May 59,461 57,379 Impairment As at 1 June and 31 May 350 350 Net book value At end of year 59,111 57,029 At start of year 57,029 38,133 Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash generating units CGUs for impairment testing.
These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The carrying value of goodwill is as follows: 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 Installation Services 55,594 55,594 Specialist Support Services 3,517 1,435 59,111 57,029 The following CGUs include goodwill with a carrying value in excess of 5m: 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 eagaheat 23,124 Horrocks Group plc 7,776 7,776 RG Francis Limited 6,963 6,963 White Horse FM Group Limited HEAT 6,409 26,709 Other CGUs 14,839 15,581 59,111 57,029 During the year ended 31 May 2009 the Group undertook a strategic reorganisation and rebranding exercise within its domestic heating businesses.
This resulted in a change in composition of two CGUs to which goodwill had previously been allocated.
The goodwill previously recognised on the acquisition of JD Heating 2,824,000 and on the English operations of HEAT 20,300,000 have been reallocated to the eagaheat CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets for the year to 31 May 2010 approved by the Board and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2-3% excluding inflation.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 12.2% which is calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 8.8% post tax.
The Directors consider that the assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts are consistent with the historical performance of each CGU and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and market forecasts.
It is believed that any reasonably forseeable movement on assumptions will not lead to an impairment and therefore sensitivity analysis has not been presented.
As at 31 May 2009 the Directors are satisfied that the values in use exceed their carrying value.

There are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables is stated after a provision for impairment of receivables has been made.
The provision is made by management based upon their assessment of the current economic environment and previous trading history with the counterparty.
Given the nature of the counterparties which include local and central Government, there is no concern over the credit quality of amounts past due not impaired.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the following types of financial risk on the financial performance of the Group by monitoring levels of borrowings and the related finance costs.
In order to ensure stability of cash out flows, and hence manage interest rate risk, the Group has a policy of using a mixture of floating and fixed rate debt.
Further to this the Group seeks to minimise the risk of uncertain funding in its operations by borrowing within a spread of maturity periods.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate costs and as such no hedge accounting is applied.
Capital Risk Management The Groups primary objectives in managing its capital are to safeguard the business as a going concern: to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to undertake its investment plans: and to optimise capital structure in order to reduce the cost of capital.
The Groups financial profile and level of financial risk is assessed on a regular basis in the light of changes to the economic conditions, business environment, changes to the Groups business profile and the risk characteristics of its businesses.
In order to maintain or adjust capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
Credit Risk The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
The Group has Board approved maximum counterparty exposure limits for specified banks and financial institutions limited to financial institutions with an A rating or higher.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk as follows: 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 31,905 15,322 Trade and other receivables 97,530 76,652 Derivative financial instruments 566 559 Current asset investments 8,644 4,938 76 Group Financial Statements eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 31.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Liquidity Risk The Group actively manages its exposure to liquidity risk and ensures maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities to provide liquidity back-up for the foreseeable future.
This has been further strengthened by the new bank facility entered into during the year.
The undrawn committed facilities and maturity profiles available to the Group at the balance sheet date are as follows: 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 Within one year 5,000 1,400 In two to five years 60,000 35,000 65,000 36,400 The Group monitors compliance against all its financial obligations so as to operate well within covenanted restrictions at all times.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group operates in Canada, India and the Republic of Ireland and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from commercial transactions, and from recognised assets, liabilities and investments in foreign operations, as well as the purchase of certain items of stock denominated in foreign currencies.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are as follows: 31 May 31 May 2009 2008 Monetary assets Canadian dollar C$000 3,291 3,609 Euro 000 1,922 1,370 Indian rupee INR000 21,356 17,952 Monetary liabilities Canadian dollar C$000 3,043 2,613 Euro 000 363 505 Indian rupee INR000 8,252 3,309 Foreign currency risk is not considered to represent a significant risk at this time as the level of foreign currency transactions is immaterial in the context of the Group and accordingly a sensitivity analysis is not presented.
Interest Rate Risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Interest bearing assets include only cash balances and current asset investments, which earn interest at a floating rate of interest linked to UK Bank Base Rate.
The Group maintains its debt at a floating rate of interest due to the low gearing of the Group other than the hire purchase obligations and redeemable preference shares that are held at a fixed rate of interest.
The following table summarises the Groups borrowings between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
31 May 31 May 2009 2008 000 000 Floating rate borrowings Property loan 289 264 289 264 Fixed rate borrowings Hire purchase obligations 205 90 Cumulative redeemable preference share 129 118 334 208 Total borrowings 623 472 Interest rate risk is not considered significant at this time as the Group is net cash positive and accordingly a sensitivity analysis is not presented.
