The terms of the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme are shown on page 59.
In February 2008 ICG completed a two for nine rights issue at 11.5p per share.
In accordance with the terms of the ICG PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the ICG PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme all outstanding option exercise prices were adjusted by a factor of 0.94797 and the number of all outstanding options were adjusted by a factor of 1.05488.
The purpose of these adjustments was to preserve the rights of the holders after such a capital change.
88 Notes to the Accounts continued 24 Share based payments continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in the year was 14.16 2008: 16.62.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 have a range of exercise prices between 6.944 and 15.704 following the rights issue adjustment 2008: 6.9 and 15.7 as follows, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.46 years 2008: 7.4 years.
The aggregate of estimated fair values of the options granted on these dates are 6.8m 2008: 3.0m.

Key Employee Retention Share Plan KERSP In the year to 31 March 2009, 365,361 shares were granted on 12 June 2008 2008: 355,895 shares were granted on 13 June 2007.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of these options is 3.9m.

20 per cent of the options granted vest in each successive year starting four years from the date granted.
The expected life has thus been calculated by assuming that options are exercised as soon as they vest, there being no exercise cost.
The Group recognised total expenses of 4.2m and 2.5m related to equity settled share based payment transactions in 2009 and 2008 respectively.

91 28 Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The Groups treasury policies seek to manage the following risks.
b Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of net assets, currency transactions and the translation of net asset, and profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the euro and the US dollar.
The Group manages its exposure to market currency risk by matching assets with debt to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The financial assets and liabilities by currency and the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to foreign exchange rates is shown in h page 94.
This is before the effect of derivative instruments.
d Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly the bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2009.
It is assumed that borrowings under the Groups revolving credit facility remains at levels as at 31 March 2009 until contractual maturity.
e Refinancing risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
This has been achieved by the ongoing private placement programme with notes maturing between five and ten years, short term borrowings under bank facilities and by issuing floating rate notes.
f Credit risk The Groups policy is to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.
The carrying amount of financial assets before any impairments best represents both the Group and Companys maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
Additional information on the concentrations of credit risk are provided by industry and country on page 11.

The total carrying amount of these instruments is 221.1m 2008: 198.6m.
The fair value of these warrants and unlisted shares cannot be reliably measured.
The range of estimates within which the aggregate fair value is highly likely to lie is 55m to 95m higher than the carrying value 2008: 70m to 110m.
Apart from the unlisted shares and warrants held at cost, the following methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair values are shown below: 94 Notes to the Accounts continued 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued Loans and receivables Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the Directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
Available for sale investments and warrants fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions or an earning based valuation technique.
Where a reliable fair value cannot be established, these are held at cost.
Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the Directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.
