BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER OF ALLBLUE LIMITED continued Mercantile Trade Finance Mercantile contributed 0.49% to AllBlue Limited during 2009, with the fund returning 4.90% Class A, USD for the calendar year.
The funds long trade finance asset positions showed good fundamental performance due to their self-liquidating nature, whilst spreads on trade finance remained wide throughout the year as banks supplied less capital to the market.
From the end of the first quarter CDS spreads rallied sharply, moving basis from record positive at the beginning of the year to record negative by the end of the year.
Whilst the portfolio was fully hedged to a resumption of systemic stress in financial markets, this move reduced the return generated by the net positive carry on the hedged portfolio.
With trade finance spreads remaining wide, by the last quarter of the year in particular the fund had good opportunities to reinvest capital from maturing assets into new positions at attractive levels of negative basis against positively convex trade finance assets.
BlueMatrix High Frequency Equity BlueMatrix contributed 1.23% to AllBlue Limited during 2009, with the fund returning a strong 17.49% Class A, USD for the calendar year.
The strategy benefited in 2009 from reasonably elevated levels of volatility in the markets and a large amount of dispersion between stocks in the equity markets: the dislocations that the strategy seeks to access are therefore more frequent and larger.
The volatility of the strategy dropped as the year progressed as the volatility of the underlying markets fell.
The diversification of this programme relative to other components of AllBlue is highlighted in the correlation grid with it being negatively correlated to four out of the six other strategies, and having a correlation of almost zero to a fifth strategy, whilst delivering positive returns please see the correlation grids on pages 18 to 20 for details.
