The total quantities ultimately recovered from the project have a low probability to exceed the sum of Proved plus Probable plus Possible Reserves Probable Reserves those additional reserves that are less likely to be recovered than Proved Reserves but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves.
It is equally likely that actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the estimated Proved plus Probable Reserves Prospect potential drilling target that is well defined, usually by seismic data Prospective Resources those quantities of petroleum which are estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations Proved Reserves those quantities of petroleum, which by analysis and geoscience, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable.
