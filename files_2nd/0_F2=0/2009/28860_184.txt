2 In April 2009, the Group concluded a series of exchange offers and tender offers with the holders of a number of Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 securities.
The exchanges involving instruments classified as liabilities all met the criteria in IFRS for treatment as the extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Gains on these exchanges, and on the redemption of securities classified as liabilities for cash, totalling 3,790 million were credited to income.
No amounts have been recognised in income in relation to the redemption of securities classified as equity or minority interest in the Group financial statements.
The difference between the consideration and the carrying value for these securities amounting to 829 million has been recorded in equity.
3 Other income includes contributions attributable to the Group from activities other than banking and insurance.
