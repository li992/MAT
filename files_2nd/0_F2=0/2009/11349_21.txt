Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as it applies to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2009 and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14: The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction during the year.
Adoption of this interpretation did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.
The directors consider the following accounting policies to be relevant in relation to the Groups financial statements.
The financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 2 June 2009 and the balance sheet was signed on the Boards behalf by Sir Derek Wanless Chairman and John Cuthbert Managing Director.
Northumbrian Water Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand pounds 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included from the date of their acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of during the period are included to the date of their disposal.
Inter segment sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Where, for commercial reasons, the accounting reference date of a subsidiary is a date other than that of the Company, management accounts made up to the Companys accounting reference date have been used.
In accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, the financial statements of two companies are consolidated as special purpose entities, with effect from 12 May 2004, the date of the transaction which utilised these entities.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used under relevant local GAAP in the individual financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities into line with those used by the Group under IFRS.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
c Associates and jointly controlled entities Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities in the Group financial statements are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the Group exercises significant inuence over the associate.
significant inuence is generally presumed to exist where the Groups effective ownership is 20% or more.
The Groups share of the post tax profits less losses of associates and jointly controlled entities is included in the consolidated income statement and the carrying value in the balance sheet comprises the Groups share of their net assets liabilities less distributions received and any impairment losses.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and jointly controlled entities, representing the excess of the cost of investment compared to the Groups share of net fair value of the associates identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the associate and is not amortised.
Financial statements of jointly controlled entities and associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the Group to take into account fair values assigned at the date of acquisition and to reect impairment losses where appropriate.
Adjustments are also made to the Groups financial statements to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entities and associates.
71 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued d Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation ceased on 31 March 2004.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions since 1 April 2004 is not amortised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management at statutory company level.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
e Intangible assets other than goodwill Other intangible xed assets represent the right to receive income under the operating agreement with the Environment Agency in respect of the Kielder Water transfer scheme.
The value of this intangible asset has been assessed with reference to the net monies raised in accordance with the Kielder securitisation on 12 May 2004.
The term of the operating agreement is in perpetuity and, accordingly, no amortisation is provided.
The value of this intangible is assessed for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated, the availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have been confirmed and the correlation between development costs and future revenues has been established.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Property, plant and equipment, including assets in the course of construction, comprise infrastructure assets being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls and other assets including properties, overground plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Borrowing costs attributed to assets under construction are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: freehold buildings, 30-60 years: operational structures, plant and machinery, 4-92 years: infrastructure assets 13-200 years see below : and xtures, ttings, tools and equipment, 4-10 years.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
Infrastructure assets In the regulated water services business, infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, reservoirs, dams and sea outfalls.
Infrastructure assets were measured at a date prior to transition to IFRS 23 May 2003 at their fair value, which was adopted as deemed historical cost on transition to IFRS.
The assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as a result of the acquisition on 23 May 2003.
72 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 1.
Accounting policies continued Expenditure on infrastructure assets which enhances the asset base is treated as xed asset additions while maintenance expenditure which does not enhance the asset base is charged as an operating cost.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated evenly to their estimated residual values over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Dams and impounding reservoirs 150 years Water mains 100 years Sea outfalls 60 years Sewers 200 years Dedicated pipelines 4-20 years g Financial assets Financial assets comprise loans to third parties, recoverable in more than one year and include cash held on long term deposit as a guaranteed investment contract relating to the Kielder securitisation.
These assets are recognised at cost and are measured annually based on the ability of the borrower to repay.
Any impairment is taken to the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
h Foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The functional and presentational currency of Northumbrian Water Group plc is United Kingdom sterling.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period.
Differences on exchange arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies and jointly controlled entities, and from the translation of the results of those companies at average rate, are taken to equity.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not cash ows.
However, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign currency is reported in the cash ow statement in order to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the period.
This amount is presented separately from cash ows from operating, investing and nancing activities, where material, and includes the differences, if any, had those cash ows been reported at end of period exchange rates.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs, as well as an element of overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present locations and condition.
j Revenues Provision of services Revenue, which excludes value added tax, represents the fair value of the income receivable in the ordinary course of business for services provided.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is not recognised until the services have been provided to the customer.
Revenue for services relates to the year, excluding any amounts paid in advance.
Revenue for measured water and waste water charges includes amounts billed plus an estimation of the amounts unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a dened methodology based upon daily average water consumption, which is calculated based upon historical billing information.
73 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Interest Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues, taking into account the effective yield of the asset.
Dividends Revenue is recognised when the shareholders right to receive the revenue is established.
k Grants and contributions Grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
Revenue grants are credited to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Capital grants and contributions relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and amortised to the income statement over the expected useful economic lives of the related assets.
l Leases Where assets are nanced by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Rentals or leasing payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and finance charges, the capital element reducing the outstanding liability and the finance charges being charged to the income statement over the period of the leasing contract at a constant rate on the reducing outstanding liability.
Rentals under operating leases where the lessor retains a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
m Pensions and other post-employment benets Dened benefit scheme The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benets to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of dened benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benets already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the dened benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benets paid during the year.
The service cost is disclosed in employment costs and the expected interest income and interest cost on obligations have been disclosed within finance costs payable income receivable.
Actuarial gains and losses on experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Dened contribution scheme The Group also operates a dened contribution scheme.
Obligations for contributions to the scheme are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
74 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 1.
Accounting policies continued n Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using the Monte-Carlo simulation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired, managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modication, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modied award, both as measured on the date of the modication.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
o Taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except: N where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and N in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in jointly controlled entities, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: N where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and N in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in jointly controlled entities, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
75 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items accounted for in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax except: N where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and N receivables and payables.
The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
p Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward exchange contracts as derivative financial instruments.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk prole of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments are always measured at fair value, with hedge accounting employed in respect of those derivatives fullling the stringent requirements for hedge accounting as prescribed under IAS 39.
In summary, these criteria relate to initial designation and documentation of the hedge relationship, prospective testing of the relationship to demonstrate the expectation that the hedge will be highly effective throughout its life and subsequent retrospective testing of the hedge to verify effectiveness.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Hedging transactions undertaken by the Company are classied as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash ow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in currency cash ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in equity.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
76 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 1.
Accounting policies continued In relation to cash ow hedges to hedge rm currency commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
When the hedged rm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged rm commitment affects the net profit and loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for special hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
q Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
Finance costs including issue costs are taken to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance charges amortised and reduced by payments made in respect of the accounting period.
The carrying amount of index linked borrowings increases annually in line with the July RPI, with the accretion being charged to the income statement as finance costs payable.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Loans and borrowings acquired at acquisition are restated to fair value.
The adjustment arising on acquisition is amortised to the income statement on the basis of the maturity prole of each instrument.
Realised gains and losses that occur from the early termination of loans and borrowings are taken to the income statement in that period.
Net debt is the sum of all current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, short term cash deposits, financial investments and loans receivable.
r Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the investments are fiderecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
s Cash and cash equivalents and short term cash deposits Cash and cash equivalents disclosed in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with a remaining maturity of up to three months or less, which are held for the purpose of meeting short term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes.
Cash equivalents are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Short term cash deposits disclosed in the balance sheet comprise cash deposited with a remaining maturity of greater than three months, a xed interest rate and which do not constitute as cash equivalents under IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
77 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued t Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Invoices for unmeasured water and waste water charges are due on xed dates: other receivables generally have 30 day payment terms.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
Trade and other receivables do not carry any interest.
u Investments Investments are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration given and including the acquisition charges associated with the investment.
v Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
w Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
x fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally fide-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the income statement.

2009 With the exception of IAS 23: Borrowing Costs Revised, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
The directors continue to assess the impact of IAS 23: Borrowing Costs Revised on the Groups financial statements.
z Key assumptions The directors consider that the key assumptions applied at the balance sheet date, which may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: N those assumptions used in arriving at the pension asset liability under IAS 19.
These key assumptions and their possible impact are disclosed in note 25, Pensions and other post-retirement benets: N the bad debt provision which is calculated by applying a range of percentages to debt of different ages.
These percentages also vary between different categories of debt.
Higher percentages are applied to those categories of debt which are considered to be of greater risk and also to debt of greater age.
The value of the bad debt provision is sensitive to the specic percentages applied: and N the asset lives assigned to property, plant and equipment, details of which can be found in note 1 f. 2.
Segmental analysis The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments.
The secondary segment reporting format is determined to be geographical.
However, as more than 98% of the Groups activities are within the UK, revenue, profit before interest, assets and liabilities have been attributed to one geographical segment.
Northumbrian Water Limited NWL is one of the ten regulated water and sewerage businesses in England and Wales.
NWL operates in the north east of England, where it trades as Northumbrian Water, and in the south east of England, where it trades as Essex & Suffolk Water.
NWL also has non-regulated activities closely related to its principal regulated activity.
Water and waste water contracts NWG owns a number of special purpose companies for specic water and waste water contracts in Scotland, Ireland and Gibraltar.

The increase of 100.8% is mainly due to the impact of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances IBA, the restatement of deferred tax in 2008 and the renancing of certain infrastructure assets.
In the absence of the IBA adjustment, the effective rate would have been 31.0%.
d Unrecognised tax losses The Group has tax losses of 8.2 million 2008: 8.7 million which have arisen in its Gibraltar subsidiary for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and it is not expected that the subsidiary will utilise significant amounts in the foreseeable future.
The losses are, however, available for offset against future taxable profits without time limit.
e Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 March 2009, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2008: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary difference associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 10.9 million 2008: 8.5 million.

The annual excess has been falling mainly because, since 1 April 2005, tax deductions for deferred revenue expenditure are claimed on a depreciation basis as originally set out in HM Revenue and Customs Tax Bulletin 53.
In addition to abolition of industrial buildings allowances, future capital allowances claims will be made at the revised rates introduced by the Finance Act 2008.
The main changes being a reduction in the rate of allowance for items of general plant and machinery from 25% to 20% per annum and an increase in the rate for long life assets from 6% to 10% per annum with effect from 1 April 2008.

Goodwill has been allocated to the water and waste water cash-generating unit and the other intangible asset has been allocated to the Northumbrian Water Limited cash-generating unit, which are also the reportable segments.
The other intangible asset represents the right in perpetuity to receive income under the operating agreement with the Environment Agency in respect of the Kielder Water transfer scheme and, therefore, the directors consider the asset has an indefinite life.
Accordingly, future cash ows, which increase in line with ination, have been discounted at a rate of 6.83% in perpetuity.
This represents a long term nominal gilt yield and an assumed credit spread.
This calculation satisfied the Group that the carrying value at 31 March 2009 had not been impaired.
Furthermore, it is improbable that the discount rate would increase to such a level that the carrying value would be impaired.
Property, plant and equipment continued Operational structures, plant and machinery include an element of land and buildings dedicated to those assets.

Financial instruments a Group strategy The level of capital expenditure which the Group is obliged to incur is such that it cannot be wholly nanced by internally generated sources.
As a result, the Group must rely upon raising additional finance on a regular basis, to be principally used to fund the long term assets required in its regulated business.
The Groups strategy is to finance such investment by raising medium to long term debt, to provide a balance sheet match with long term assets and to x a major proportion of interest rates.
91 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Financial instruments continued b Treasury operations The main purpose of the Groups treasury function is to assess the Groups ongoing capital requirement and to raise funding on a timely basis, taking advantage of any favourable market opportunities.
It also invests any surplus funds the Group may have, based upon its forecast requirements and in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
On occasions, derivatives are used as part of this process but the Groups policies prohibit their use for speculation.
c Risks arising from the Groups financial instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
All treasury activities are conducted in accordance with these policies.
d Liquidity risk As regards day to day liquidity, the Groups policy is to have available standby committed bank borrowing facilities with a value of no less than 50.0 million and with a bank agreement availability period of no less than three months.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had 75.0 million of undrawn committed bank facilities 2008: 75.0 million.
e Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
It borrows at both xed and oating rates of interest and, accordingly, uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest prole and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
The Groups policy is to keep a minimum 60% of its borrowings at xed rates of interest.
At 31 March 2009, 75% 2008: 63% of the Groups borrowings were at xed rates of interest.
Index linked borrowings are treated as variable rate debt.
f Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is that any foreign currency exposure in excess of 100,000 sterling equivalent of a transactional nature, or 3.0 million sterling equivalent of a translation nature, should be covered immediately on identication.
g Market price risk The Groups exposure to market price risk principally comprises interest rate exposures.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk.
On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that a 1% rise in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Groups pre-tax profits.
h Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Managements assessment of the maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
A significant proportion of the trade debtor balances are with domestic customers who are unlikely to have a published credit rating.
i Counterparty risk The treasury strategy which is approved by the Board, requires that investments are limited to certain money market and treasury instruments, and that the Groups exposure to any single bank, building society or market is controlled, with maximum deposits allowed with any single counterparty.
The investment criteria cover credit rating and asset size, including sovereign and political risk.
Current market conditions have resulted in closer monitoring of counterparties and cancellation or suspension of deposits.

Pensions and other post-retirement benets The Group operates a dened benefit pension scheme, Northumbrian Water Pension Scheme NWPS or the scheme, providing benets based on final pensionable remuneration to 2,169 active members at 31 March 2009 2008: 2,391.
The assets of the NWPS are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 December 2007.
At that date the value of assets amounted to 732.3 million and the funding level was 106.1%.
The future service contribution rate jointly payable by members and the employers from 31 December 2007 was 22.6% of pensionable salaries.
Members contributions are 7.3% on average with the employers paying 15.3%.
The employer contribution rate was assessed using the projected unit method and the following actuarial assumptions: % Pre-retirement 6.1 Post-retirement 5.2 Pay increases 3.65 Pension increases 3.4 Price ination 3.4 Following the 2004 actuarial valuation the employers had prepaid contributions to the scheme up to 31 December 2010.
The scheme actuary recommended that regular contributions should recommence from 1January2011.
The scheme also has a dened contribution section which had 310 active members at 31 March 2009 2008: 219.
Members can choose to contribute either, 3%, 4% or 5% of salary, with employers contributing at either, 6%, 7% or 8% depending on the member contribution rate.

Pensions and other post-retirement benets continued The Group through its subsidiary, AquaGib, also operates a non-contributory dened benefit scheme.
The surplus at 31 March 2009, under local GAAP, was 0.3 million 2008: 0.2 million.
The Group made contributions amounting to 0.5 million 2008: 0.6 million to the dened benefit pension scheme.
Sensitivity to key assumptions: IAS 1 requires disclosure of the sensitivity of the results to the methods and assumptions used.
The costs of a pension arrangement require estimates regarding future experience.
The financial assumptions used for IAS 19 reporting are the responsibility of the directors of the Company.
These assumptions reect market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Changes in market conditions which result in changes in the net discount rate essentially the difference between the discount rate and the assumed rates of increases of salaries, deferred pension revaluation or pensions in payment, can have a significant effect on the value of the liabilities reported.
A reduction in the net discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities, as a higher value is placed on benets paid in the future.
A rise in the net discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.
The overall effect of a change in the net discount rate of 0.1% would change the liabilities by around 12.0 million.
There is also uncertainty around life expectancy for the UK population.
The value of current and future pension benets will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.
The disclosures have been prepared using the mortality assumptions adopted for the 2007 formal valuation namely the PCMA PCFA00 tables, applying a medium cohort adjustment with a 115% loading to mortality rates based on the year of birth of the membership.
These assumptions imply an assumed life expectancy for a member aged 65 at 31 March 2009 of 20.6 years 2008: member aged 60 years of 25.2 years for males and 22.9 years 2008: member aged 60 years of 28.0 years for females.
The effect of increasing the assumed life expectancies by one year would be to increase the value of liabilities by around 2.9%.
Share incentive plans Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual conditional awards of shares in the Company.
Further details of the LTIP can be found in the directors remuneration report on page 57.
The following table illustrates the movements in conditional share awards during the year.

The fair value of conditional share awards granted during the year was 0.1 million 2008: 0.1 million.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the conditional share awards is 248.08 pence 2008: 343.34 pence.
For the conditional awards outstanding as at 31 March 2009, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.8 years 2008: 1.7 years.

Share incentive plans continued The fair value of conditional share awards granted was estimated using the Monte-Carlo model.
The significant inputs to the model were as follows: 31.3.
2008 Dividend yield 4.9% 3.5% Expected share price volatility 28% 24% Share price at award 251.50p 334.00p Expected FTSE 250 Index volatility 23% 13% Risk free interest rate 2.6% 4.6% Expected life of option years 3 3 The expected life of these options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP scheme provides one free matching share for every three shares purchased by an employee.
Shares for the SIP are purchased at market price by the Trustee and dividends are paid in cash directly to participants.
Special purpose entities As noted under accounting policy 1 b, under SIC 12, two companies are consolidated as special purpose entities.

Outstanding balances due from related parties are expected to be settled within 60 days and amounts due to related parties are in respect of leasing arrangements, where the amounts owed will relate specically to the terms of the lease.
Contingent liability The Groups subsidiary responsible for a contract with Scottish Water, Caledonian Environmental Services plc CES, has received a claim from its Design and Construction Consortium DCC, primarily in respect of the DCCs additional costs attributed by it to non-conforming inuent at the treatment works.
CES is defending this claim and has also issued a counterclaim against the DCC.
As non-conforming inuent is ultimately the responsibility of the client, CES has protected its position by issuing a claim against Scottish Water.
The directors do not expect any material loss to arise as a result of these claims.
