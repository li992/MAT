IFRS 3R introduces a number of changes in the accounting for goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs, and the future reported results.
IAS 27R requires that change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Therefore, such changes will have no impact on goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or a loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The changes introduced by IFRS 3R and IAS 27R must be applied prospectively and will affect future acquisitions and transactions with minority interests.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective that will have a significant impact for the Group.

Goodwill and intangible assets included in continuing operations Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability arising on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences.
The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons: Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets: there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services: and existing law acts to restrict entry.
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost.
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
Customer relationships relate to contracted relationships acquired as part of a business combination.

indd 80 25 02 2010 23:13 16 Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets The Group tests annually for impairment and at each reporting date if there are indications that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired, by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired.
Goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 m m Goodwill UK Retail 35.4 35.4 Other European Retail 13.2 13.5 Italy Retail 5.5 During 2009, following the decision to sell Italy Retail, an impairment charge of 4.5 million was recognised.
Of the remaining 1.0 million, goodwill totalling 0.6 million was disposed of and there was a foreign exchange adjustment of 0.4 million.
No additional impairments were identified.
Licences Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets.
Each CGU represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes.
The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2009 was 507.2 million 2008: 579.0 million.
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These are based on budgets approved by management for the next five years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate 2008: 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied.
The estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, managements best estimate of future trends and performance taking account of industry sources.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.5% 2008: 10.3%.
The recoverable amounts of certain individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 2009 and accordingly an impairment loss of 3.2 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2009 within the non-trading Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets line item.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate.
Change in the cash flow projections or the discount rate would trigger a further impairment loss.
For example, a reduction in projected cash flows of 10% and an increase of 1% in the discount rate would have resulted in a further impairment loss of approximately 0.8 million.
Customer relationships Customer relationships of 40.5 million 2008: 40.5 million have been allocated to a CGU within the eGaming operating segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU within the eGaming segment is considerably in excess of the carrying amount of the customer relationships and accordingly no impairment charge was required.

indd 86 25 02 2010 23:13 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Groups treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, cash and short-term deposits, together with certain derivative financial instruments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Groups financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than betting and gaming transactions.
The Groups exposure to antepost betting and gaming transactions is not significant.
The Group has a 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme that is used to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to source, cost, size and maturity.
At 31 December 2009, following the repayment of the 464.5 million bond, one public Eurobond issue remained under this programme, a 250 million 7.125% bond, maturing July 2012.
Several loan notes have also been issued under the programme in a variety of currencies.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had one remaining loan note with a carrying value of 16.4 million.
Funds raised via the EMTN programme have been used to repay bank debt.
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups policy for the year ended 31 December 2009 was to maintain a minimum of 25% 2008: 25% of net debt at fixed interest rates to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
At 31 December 2009, after taking account of interest rate and cross currency swaps, 457.3 million or 63.9% 2008: 451.3 million or 40.3% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months.
Interest on financial instruments at fixed rates is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Profit before tax Equity 2009 2008 2009 2008 Effect on: m m m m 100 basis points increase 1.6 6.4 0.3 0.5 200 basis points increase 3.3 12.7 0.7 1.0 100 basis points decrease 1.6 6.4 0.3 0.5 200 basis points decrease 3.0 12.7 0.7 1.0 The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at the year end.
Foreign currency risk The Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises and has foreign exchange exposure to the Euro, arising from foreign currency assets.
The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is monitored and reviewed regularly.
Until 30 June 2009 the Group sought to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure arising from the translation of foreign currency assets through Euro drawings under its committed facilities.
The Group ceased formal net investment hedging on 30 June 2009.
The total carrying value of the Groups foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2009 was 17.6 million 2008: 593.3 million, of which 16.4 million 2008: 475.0 million was swapped into sterling.

indd 87 25 02 2010 23:13 Statutory reportS and financial StatementS noteS to the conSolidated financial StatementS continued 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Exchange rate sensitivity The impact of 10% and 20% movements in the exchange rates between sterling and the Euro is shown below: Profit before tax Equity 2009 2008 2009 2008 Effect on: m m m m Euro 1 10% movement in the exchange rate 0.4 4.0 10.8 4.9 1 20% movement in the exchange rate 0.7 7.6 21.6 9.0 1 The movement is a loss where sterling strengthens and a gain where it weakens.
The impact on equity relates primarily to unhedged foreign exchange exposure arising on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These sensitivities have been calculated before adjusting for tax and have been estimated by applying the percentage movement to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in Euros at the year end.
Credit risk The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individual basis.
The Groups High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes.
The Group manages this activity and the associated risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed.
Of the 13.7 million 2008: 4.5 million trade receivables balance, 12.6 million 2008: 3.7 million relates to the Groups Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and a loan to a joint venture, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group.
This risk is partly mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees.
For further detail of these guarantees refer to note 26, page 90.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2009, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 428.1 million 2008: 510.4 million.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.6 years 2008: 2.8 years.
The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows: On demand or within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Total 2009 m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 51.5 343.7 389.1 784.3 Derivatives 8.7 6.9 1.3 16.9 Other financial liabilities 0.9 1.3 3.3 21.4 26.9 Trade and other payables 126.9 126.9 Total 188.0 351.9 393.7 21.4 955.0 On demand or within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Total 2008 m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 522.7 55.9 703.2 1,281.8 Derivatives 4.7 4.7 4.6 14.0 Other financial liabilities 0.9 0.9 2.8 22.2 26.8 Trade and other payables 196.6 196.6 Total 724.9 61.5 710.6 22.2 1,519.2 The total gross contractual undiscounted cash inflows in relation to derivative financial instrument assets used to hedge the risks associated with interest bearing loans and borrowings are 1.4 million 2008: 109.7 million within one year and nil 2008: 0.8 million within one to two years.

At 31 December 2009, the Group had foreign currency borrowings of nil 2008: 117.6 million and foreign exchange swap contracts with a nominal value of nil 2008: 0.1 million designated as net investment hedges in respect of the currency translation risk arising on foreign operations.
Pre-tax losses of 10.4 million 2008: 17.8 million post-tax losses of 7.5 million 2008: 12.8 million arising on the translation of these borrowings have been deferred in reserves.
The Group continued to hold cross currency swaps until their maturity in July 2009.
These swaps did not qualify as net investment hedges under IAS 39 but were economic hedges of the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
The fair value of the Groups cross currency swaps at 31 December 2009 is nil 2008: an asset of 109.1 million.
The fair value of the Groups foreign exchange swaps at 31 December 2009 is a liability of 0.1 million 2008: an asset of 2.8 million.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings by swapping borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group.
Contracts with nominal values of 16.2 million 2008: 451.0 million have fixed interest receipts and floating interest payments based on LIBOR.
Contracts hedging the 464.5 million bond matured in July 2009.
The fair value of the swaps at 31 December 2009 is an asset of 0.4 million 2008: asset of 4.7 million.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its cash flow exposure.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had contracts for interest rate swaps with nominal values of 199.0 million 2008: 199.0 million maturing between January 2011 and January 2012.
These contracts have floating rate receipts and fixed rate payables.
The fair value at 31 December 2009 was a liability of 9.2 million 2008: 11.2 million that has been deferred in equity in retained earnings.
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement arising from cash flow hedges.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise funds at an economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure net debt and equity see note 27 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity, pages 93 and 61, for further details and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The target range is less than 3.0 2008: 3.5 to 3.75 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The ratio at 31 December 2009 was 2.5 3.3 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers and at 31 December 2008 was 2.6 3.3 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers.

The Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2010 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is 933.0 million 31 December 2008: 943.1 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 517.2 million 31 December 2008: 528.5 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 415.8 million 31 December 2008: 414.6 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2009 is 407.7 million 31 December 2008: 430.1 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 201.0 million 31 December 2008: 219.1 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 206.7 million 31 December 2008: 211.0 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of the credit profile of the counterparty, HHC, to assess the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2009 the Group has recognised a financial liability of 9.3 million 31 December 2008: 9.0 million in respect of these guarantees.
Fair value of guarantees liability 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 9.0 10.0 Change in fair value attributable to hotels default risk 0.6 4.0 Change in fair value attributable to time lapse 0.3 Guarantees expiring in the year 5.0 At 31 December 9.3 9.0 Fair value of guarantee asset 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 3.0 Change in fair value attributable to credit risk of counterparty 3.0 At 31 December The change in the year in the fair value of the financial guarantees liability has been recognised in the consolidated income statement and classified in discontinued operations.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.7 million.

The LSOT may also be used in connection with the Companys other share-based plans, including the Ladbrokes plc International Share Option Scheme.
The trustee of the LSOT, Computershare Trustees CI Limited, purchases the Companys shares in the open market, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated liabilities of the Group, with financing provided by the Company.
Under the Plans, awards of shares are made either in the form of conditional shareholdings or nil priced options for certain non-UK executives once the bonuses for the year ended 31 December have been finalised.
Awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan will vest two years or three years in respect of awards made from 2008 onwards to executive directors and certain senior executives after the award date.
Awards made under the Restricted Share Plan will vest in their entirety after three years employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest after two years.
Shares in the LSOT have been conditionally gifted to employees.
Shares are forfeited by employees who leave, other than for specified reasons, within the vesting period.
All expenses of the LSOT are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred.
The number of ordinary shares held in trust for both periods presented has been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.
The Ladbrokes Share Incentive Plan LSIP is currently used in connection with the Companys OWN share plan the OWN plan and Freeshare share plan Freeshare.

Under the OWN plan, to match those shares acquired using participants salary deductions, one additional share is issued by the Company to the LSIP for every two held per employee.
These shares are forfeited by employees who leave, other than for specified reasons, within the one year conditional vesting period.
At 31 December 2009, the LSIP held 1,055,597 shares, all of which are held on behalf of the OWN plan and Freeshare participants.

The sources used to determine the best estimate of long-term returns include bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
At 31 December 2009, the long-term expected rates of return on equity instruments and debt instruments were assumed to be 8.2% pa and 4.6% pa, respectively, for the plan.
The equivalent assumptions at 31 December 2008 were 7.4% pa and 4.1% pa respectively.
The post retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard PNA00 mortality table with medium cohort projection, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2009 is 85.8 years for males and 87.8 years for females.
For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed 89.2 for males and 91.0 for females.
The post retirement mortality assumption has been updated slightly since 2008 when expected future lifetimes were generally assumed to be 85.7 years for males aged 65 and 87.7 years for females, with longer lifetimes assumed for members with large pensions of 89.1 years for males and 90.9 years for females.

For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for the year ended 31 December 2009, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items: 2009 2008 m m 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.5 0.6 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 18.1 17.3 This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value of the bond assets held by the plan.

The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below.
All of the plans listed below are equity settled share-based payment plans.
In October 2009 the Company raised proceeds of 274.6 million, net of issue costs of approximately 11.0 million, through a rights issue as explained in note 28, page 93.
The number of shares allocated to employees under the Groups share schemes has been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.
The terms of the Groups employee share schemes were adjusted such that participants of the various plans were no better or worse off as a result of the rights issue.
Consequently, no additional expense was or will be recognised as a result of changes to the Groups employee share schemes.
i Annual bonus deferral into shares An award under the bonus plan will vest for each annual bonus year as set out below.
2009 and 2008 For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after three years.
For other employees, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
2007 For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after three years.
For other employees, half of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
2006 Half of the gross annual bonus was delivered in shares that vested, subject to continued employment, after two years.

Other leases are typically between three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease arrangements, although there were occasionally non-financial restrictions on leases preventing the Group from opening or operating another competing hotel for a specified number of years.
Subleases The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.
