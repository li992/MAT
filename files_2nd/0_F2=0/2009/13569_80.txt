Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise floating rate convertible loan stock.
The conversion conditions are such that fair value approximates to the book value.
B Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
C Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices Level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures D Borrowing and financial RRSPs are carried at amortised cost.
Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
For financial RRSPs, the contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts.

The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
From January 1, 2005, the Group has not included foreign exchange or commodity financial instruments in any cash flow hedging relationships for accounting purposes.
To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.
Movements in the fair values of foreign exchange and commodity instruments were as follows: Foreign exchange Commodity instruments instruments m m At January 1, 2008 379 39 1,2 Fair value gains to fair value hedges 83 1 Fair value losses to other derivative contracts 2,383 96 Fair value of contracts settled 236 32 Fair value of derivative contracts assumed on formation of joint venture 24 At January 1, 2009 2,181 89 1,2 Fair value losses to fair value hedges 33 Fair value losses to net investment hedges 14 1 Fair value gains to other derivative contracts 1,783 52 Fair value of contracts settled 301 26 At December 31, 2009 144 11 1 Included in financing 2 Profit on related hedged items 33m 2008 83m loss.
Interest rate financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.
Where the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the hedging reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item.
During 2008 and 2009, the Group did not have any cash flow hedges, other than in joint ventures, which are not included in this analysis.
Movements in the fair values of interest rate financial instruments were as follows: Included in Other fair value interest rate hedging financial Total relationships instruments m m m At January 1, 2008 39 42 3 1,2 Fair value changes 235 236 1 At January 1, 2009 274 278 4 1,2 Fair value changes 75 77 2 At December 31, 2009 199 201 2 1 Included in financing 2 Profit on related hedged items 77m 2008 236m loss.
Financial risk and revenue sharing partnerships RRSPs The Group has financial liabilities arising from financial RRSPs.
These financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost method.
This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash flows of the arrangements using the internal rate of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate.
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2009 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 123 16 Financial instruments continued Movements in the amortised cost values of financial RRSPs were as follows: 2009 2008 m m At January 1 455 315 Cash paid to partners 55 53 Additions 15 40 Exchange adjustments direct to reserves 6 6 1 Financing charge 26 26 Excluded from underlying profit: 1 Exchange adjustments 45 118 1 Restructuring of financial RRSP agreements and changes in forecast payments 27 3 At December 31 363 455 1 Included in financing, excluding 1m of finance charge capitalised in intangible assets.
Risk management policies and hedging activities The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: liquidity risk: credit risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash flows most significantly US dollars, followed by the Euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The profile of the maturity of the Groups committed facilities is shown in the Finance Directors review.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Groups risk management activities.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with single A or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk, floating rate borrowings, cash and cash equivalents cash flow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
These are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to three months.
The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.

Some of the Groups borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants.
If the Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities.
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Groups facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a given movement in the Groups credit rating.
In addition, the Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available as follows: 2009 2008 m m Expiring after two years 450 650 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2009 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 129 16 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies.
The most significant transactional currency exposures are US dollar with sterling and US dollar with euro.
At December 31, 2009 if sterling had weakened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 864m lower 2008 890m.
If sterling had strengthened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 707m higher 2008 728m.
There would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives.
At December 31, 2009 if the euro had weakened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity for the year would have been 88m lower 2008 102m.
If the euro had strengthened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 72m higher 2008 84m.
At December 31, 2009 if the price of commodities had been ten per cent lower, with all other variables remaining constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 11m lower 2008 13m.
If the price of commodities had been ten per cent higher, with all other variables remaining constant, profit after tax and equity would have been 11m higher 2008 13m, arising mainly as the result of higher fair value gains on derivatives.
There would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
At December 31, 2009 the Group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date.
The main interest rate sensitivity for the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 64.
B Shares and C Shares and payments to shareholders The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares C Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
C Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash.
Any C Shares retained attract a dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
From July 2004 to July 2008, the Company issued non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares B Shares.
The only significant difference was that B Shares, unlike C Shares, also carried the right to convert directly into ordinary shares.
In September 2008, the Company exercised its option to compulsorily redeem all B Shares then in issue.
The Company does not intend to issue B Shares in the future.
Movements in the B C Shares during the year were as follows: 2009 2008 C Shares B Shares C Shares Nominal B Shares Nominal of 0.1p each value of 0.1p each value Millions m Millions m Authorised At January 1, and December 31 2,000,000 2,000 1,000,000 1,000 Issued and fully paid At January 1 15,859 16 Issued 263,776 264 236,740 237 Converted into ordinary shares 52,524 53 Redeemed 251,199 251 200,075 200 At December 31 12,577 13 Payments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.
