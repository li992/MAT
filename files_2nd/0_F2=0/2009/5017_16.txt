8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.

Annual General Meeting Financial statements Governance Business review Dunelm Group plc Annual report & accounts 2009 38 Notes to the annual financial statements continued 16 Interest bearing loans and borrowings continued Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at the period end was: 2009 2009 2009 Effective 2008 2008 2008 Effective Total Floating rate Fixed rate interest Total Floating rate Fixed rate interest 000 000 000 rate % 000 000 000 rate % Revolving bank loan 10,000 10,000 6.31 Overdraft 18 18 2.00 20 20 6.00 18 18 2.00 10,020 20 10,000 6.31 All liabilities are denominated in sterling.
The floating rate on the overdraft is linked to Barclays Bank Base Rate and the Group believes that an increase in the rate of 1% would not have had a material impact on profit before tax for the period Financial assets at 4 July 2009 consisted of 24,016,000 2008: 2,853,000 cash at bank: interest earned is at normal commercial rates.
17 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business has been developed.
A register of strategic and operational risks is maintained and reviewed quarterly by the Board, who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties, and uses publicly available financial information to rate its customers.
As the principal business of the Group is retail related, trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of customers, which tend to be charity or local authority based.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
The Groups available facilities can be found in note 16.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Subsequent to the year end the Group has capped credit limits with approved counterparties at 20m.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges linked to LIBOR and Barclays Bank Base Rate.
The Directors do not consider that future changes in interest rates are likely to cause a material direct impact on profitability.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities are detailed in note 16.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases denominated in US dollars.
These amounted to approximately 10% of the total purchases in the year ended 4 July 2009.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the year end were $400,000 2008: $870,000.
The Group manages its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by purchasing US dollars on the spot market at levels required to meet medium-term purchases.
As at 4 July 2009 the Group held US dollar balances of $2.2m 2008: $7.0m, in order to protect itself against short-term fluctuations in the US dollar rate.
This was expected to cover purchases in US dollars for approximately two months.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group would seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value.
Dunelm Group plc Annual report & accounts 2009 39 17 Financial risk management continued Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programme.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
The following table is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 4 July 2009 and 29 June 2008.

Options have a vesting period of three years from date of grant and a maximum life of 10 years.
All options granted prior to IPO have an exercise price equal to the market value as agreed with HMRC at date of grant: all subsequent grants have had an exercise price equal to market price at date of grant.
There are no performance conditions but there is a requirement that the Groups shares be traded on a public exchange at date of exercise, and the awards are also subject to continued employment with the Group.

The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee.
Two grants were made in the year, to the Executive Directors and senior management.
The Executive Directors grant in September 2008 is exercisable in September 2011 and the senior management grant in July 2008 is exercisable in July 2010.
The grant to the Executive Directors is dependent on the level of growth in Group EPS relative to RPI.
The grant to senior management is dependent on continuing employment within the Group.
The maximum life of options under the LTIP is 10 years from the date of grant.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the options.
This has been calculated as follows: September September March 2008 2007 2007 Share price at date of grant 149.0p 196.0p 229.0p Discount factor, based on dividend yield of 3.0% to vesting date 0.889 0.913 0.913 Fair value of option 132.5p 178.9p 209.0p The number and weighted average exercise price of options under the LTIP at 4 July 2009 is as follows: Weighted Weighted average Number average Number exercise of shares exercise of shares price under option price under option 2009 2009 2008 2008 Outstanding at beginning of year 568,356 250,434 Granted during year 713,554 317,922 Forfeited during year 18,339 Outstanding at end of year 1,263,571 568,356 In addition, bonuses earned during the year by a number of senior managers will be paid in the form of nil cost share options, exercisable in September 2011, provided the individuals remain in employment with the Group at that date.
The value of these options has been estimated on the basis of the assumed share price at the date of grant September 2009 and the cost will be spread over the period from 29 June 2008 to 30 September 2011.
