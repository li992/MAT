The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
They were approved by the Board on 23 March 2010.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling, as that is the functional currency of the Company.
The financial statements for the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP on the basis of the accounting policies set out in note 2 below.
These financial statements comprise the profit and loss account, balance sheet and related notes.

The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related party disclosures from disclosing transactions with other members of the Charter Group.
2  The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Foreigncurrencies Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account.
 Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
 Deferred income taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or liability.
Deferred income taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred income taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Sharebasedpayments The Company operates equitysettled sharebased compensation plans.
These include awards made in respect of shares in the then Charter plc exchanged for awards in respect of shares in the Company, following the Scheme of Arrangement establishing the Company as the holding company of the then Charter plc in 2008.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
The Companys liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such sharebased compensation is accounted for as equitysettled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 Sharebased payment, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent Charter International plc, the Company has recognised an addition to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of 1.0 million with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders funds.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the period when paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment has been established and is unconditional.
