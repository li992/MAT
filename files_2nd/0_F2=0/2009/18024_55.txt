CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk.
They are initially recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value based on market price.
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost, and subsequently reviewed for impairment.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and subsequently measured at amortised cost until settled.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds on issue and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Any transaction costs and premiums or discounts are recognised over the contractual life using the effective interest method.
In the event of early termination, all unamortised transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Compound instruments At the date of issue of compound instruments, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-compound debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue and the fair value of the liability is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components based on their relative initial carrying values.
The liability element of compound instruments is subsequently measured using the expected interest rate method.
The value of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent periods.
