Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2009 Page 41 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts issued in January 2009.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 01 08: Distributable Profits, changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as realised.
As a result of the new SORP, capital reserves realised and unrealised are now shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the balance sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash with the exception of unlisted investments with a fair value of 347,000. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments at fair value and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate on the security.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term loans and deposits is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash foregone, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where appropriate, certain derivatives such as contracts for difference are used.
Income received from dividends on long contracts for difference and interest on short contracts for difference and expenses paid out as dividends on short contracts for difference and interest on long contracts for difference are included in Net derivative expenses in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost and subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments and AIM quoted investments are valued at bid prices, where the bid price is available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establis h what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
Transaction costs In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes these costs in the cost of investments purchased and has disclosed them in Note 10 on page 47.
Page 42 Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements h Derivatives Where appropriate, certain permitted transactions involving derivatives are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter comprise futures, equity forwards, contracts for difference and options and are measured at fair value.
The fair value is as follows: futures and options the quoted trade price for the contract contracts for difference and equity forwards the difference between the settlement price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract unrealised gains loss.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income and expenses derived from them are included in Net derivative expenses via the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included in Gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within Current assets and Creditors amounts falling due within one year.
As part of an established policy, premiums received on written options are taken to capital and are recognised within the gains on derivative instruments via the capital column of the Income Statement.
On the basis of immateriality, the fair value of the derivative positions was included in Fixed assets in the previous years financial statements.
i Loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
j Capital reserve Gains and losses on the realisation of investments, including derivatives, and changes in the fair value of investments, including derivatives, are accounted for in the capital reserve, via the capital column of the Income Statement.
k Dividends In accordance with FRS21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.

This Note is incorporated in accordance with FRS29 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations UK sterling borrowings to finance operations Derivative instruments which include equity forwards, contracts for difference and listed options on stocks and equity indice s The risks identified by FRS29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises other price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with the underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in accordance with the Companys Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2009 Page 51 Notes to the Financial Statements Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through a UK sterling denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loan, which falls due for repayment on 26 January 2010.
The Company is therefore not exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increase in UK sterling interest rates on this loan.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The analysis below summarises the extent to which the Companys assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates.
2009 cash flow fair value interest interest rate risk rate risk total 000 000 000 Derivative assets exposure 16,276 16,276 Cash balances 8,930 8,930 Total financial assets 25,206 25,206 Derivative liabilities exposure 14,623 14,623 Fixed rate unsecured loan 27,000 27,000 Total financial liabilities 14,623 27,000 41,623 Total financial assets liabilities 10,583 27,000 16,417 2008 cash flow fair value interest interest rate risk rate risk total 000 000 000 Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc 9,091 9,091 Cash balances 16,567 16,567 Total financial assets 25,658 25,658 Fixed rate unsecured loans 35,000 35,000 Total financial liabilities 35,000 35,000 Total financial assets liabilities 25,658 35,000 9,342 Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency which is sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with UK sterling currency borrowings, thereby potentially hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange rate movements.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.

Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2009 Page 53 Notes to the Financial Statements Financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital, reserves and borrowings.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise its UK sterling denominated loans and other short term creditors.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial liabilities is shown below.

Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in Notes 13 and 14 on page 49 to the financial statements.
Counterparty risk All securities and derivatives are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis function and approved for use by any Fidelity managed company.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored and reported frequently.
Margin on exchange-traded derivatives mitigates counterparty risk exposure in accordance with the terms outlined in market standard ISDA derivative legal contracts.
Credit risk Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and the derivatives exposure.
Derivatives The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivatives, are set out in a documented Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document, details of which can be seen in the other risk categories disclosed above.
As set out in a documented Derivative Instrument Charter, the derivatives are used by the Manager for the following purposes: To equitise cash and gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial outflow of capital.
To hedge equity market risk to position short exposure via derivatives with the intention of at least partially mitigating lo sses in the exposures in the Companys portfolio as a result of falls in the equity market.
To enhance portfolio yield by writing short call options covered call writing and the selected use of other option strate gies.
To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of share s which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions therefore distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and performance contribution of these instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist derivatives team which draws on over forty years of specialist experience in derivative risk management.
This team draws upon sophisticated portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Manager on portfolio construction.
Page 54 Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 23 and 24 of the Directors Report.
An increase of 10% in the fair value of the investments at 31 August 2009 would have increased total return on ordinary activities and total assets by 35,538,000 2008: 33,131,200.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The analysis for 2008 is performed on the same basis.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis At 31 August 2009, if interest rates had increased by 0.5% the total return on ordinary activities would have increased by 53,000 2008: 128,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 0.5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis At 31 August 2009, if sterling had strengthened by 10% in relation to the larger currency exposures, then with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The derivative element of the analysis is based on the underlying exposure of the derivative assets and liabilities.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the larger currency exposures, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
2009 2008 000 000 Euro 595 642 Swedish krona 301 209 Swiss franc 149 1,368 Derivatives exposure sensitivity analysis Equity derivatives The Company invests in contracts for difference to gain exposure to equity markets.
A 10% fall in the price of the net contracts for difference would have resulted in a decrease of 206,000 2008: increase of 805,000 in the Companys net asset value.
A rise of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The Company invests in equity forwards to gain exposure to the equity markets.
A 10% fall in the price of the equity forwards would have resulted in an increase of 24,000 2008: 125,000 in the Companys net asset value.
At the year end the Company had no futures exposure to the equity markets.
Options The Company writes call options on selected underlying equity positions, receiving a premium, but obligating it to sell the physical stock at a fixed price.
Using the deltas of the options at the year end date, where an options delta is a ratio that compares the change in the price of the underlying equity to the corresponding change in the price of the option, a 10% rise in the price of the underlying equities would have resulted in a decrease of 323,000 2008: 447,000 in the Companys net asset value.
A fall of 10% would have had a similar but opposite effect.
The Company also writes put options on selected underlying equity positions, receiving a premium, but obligating it to purchase the physical stock at a fixed price.
Using the deltas of the options at the year end date, where an options delta is a ratio that compares the change in the price of the underlying equity to the corresponding change in the price of the option, a 10% rise in the price of the underlying equities would have resulted in an increase of 62,000 2008: nil in the Companys net asset value.
For details of the Companys derivatives exposure see Note 11 on page 48.
Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2009 Page 55 Notes to the Financial Statements Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Note 1 on page 42 investments are shown at fair value which is bid market price.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the UK sterling denominated fixed rate unsecured loans, whose fair value as at 31 August 2009, given below, have been calculated by discounting future cash flows at UK sterling interest rates.
2009 2008 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan@ 5.655% per annum 7,963 8,000 Fixed rate unsecured loan@ 5.435% per annum 27,416 27,000 26,924 27,000 27,416 27,000 34,887 35,000 Capital Management The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
