The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 130 to 134.
VT Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and have been applied consistently by Group companies.
The Groups results for the year have not been materially affected by the adoption of any new accounting standards.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies i Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value and under the going concern basis as detailed in the Going concern section of the Corporate governance report on page 54 of the Annual report.
The Group financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are stated in m except where otherwise indicated.
ii Changes in accounting policy Changes in accounting presentation segmental information As detailed in note 4, the segmental information for the year ended 31 March 2008 has been restated to reflect better the nature of the Groups operations following the transfer of the Groups interests in naval shipbuilding and related support businesses to BVT Surface Fleet Limited, and the acquisition of a 45 per cent interest in that business as set out in note 5.
Changes in accounting presentation disclosure of pension financing items In order to give greater comparability with our peer companies, our accounting policy in respect of the presentation of pension financing items has been changed to present them as components of finance income and expense rather than as a component of operating profit.
Prior period comparatives have been restated to reflect this change with the effect of reducing previously reported operating profit by 6.4m and a corresponding reduction in net financing costs.
There is no effect on reported profit before tax resulting from this change.
Changes in accounting measurement business combinations In accordance with IFRS 3, the Group has reassessed the provisional fair values and purchase consideration in respect of the acquisition of VT Nuclear Services Limited made in the prior financial year.
As a result of this reassessment, goodwill arising from the transaction has increased by 3.3m from that previously assessed.
In addition, trade and other receivables decreased by 1.7m: current tax liabilities decreased by 1.2m: deferred tax assets increased by 1.3m: trade and other payables increased by 1.4m: and provisions increased by 2.7m.
There was no effect on the reported profit for the prior year.
iii Use of judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, the areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed in the following notes: Note 5 Discontinued operations Note 7 Exceptional items Note 17 Goodwill impairment reviews Note 20 Business combinations and disposals measurement of fair values Note 30 Provisions measurement of long term provisions including industrial injury Note 35 Share-based payments measurement of fair value of awards Note 41 Retirement benefits selection of assumptions for measurement of liability iv Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of VT Group plc and its subsidiaries at each balance sheet date, and include its share of its joint ventures and associates results on the equity method.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date on which control passes.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 74 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued v Investments in associates and joint ventures Joint ventures are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its partners under a contractual agreement.
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Groups share of post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated income statement as an element of profit before tax.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the net investment in joint ventures and associates is carried as a non-current asset at the share of the joint ventures or associates equity including any goodwill arising on the Groups acquisition of its interest.
vi Revenue Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided, excluding VAT and trade discounts.
Revenue is recognised upon the performance of services or transfer of risk to the customer.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied: the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which is generally when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer: the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold: the amount of revenue can be measured reliably: it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group: and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Rendering of services When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The outcome of the transaction is deemed to be able to be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: the amount of revenue can be measured reliably: it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity: the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably: and the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
In the case of the majority of the Groups long-term service contracts which may involve an indeterminate number of acts over a specified period of time, revenue will be recognised on a straight-line basis unless other evidence such as the direct costs incurred in delivering those services provides a more appropriate way of estimating the stage of completion.
Where a contract for goods or services involves delivery of several different elements typically representing the delivery of a construction phase and services phase and is not fully delivered or performed by the year end, revenue is recognised based on the proportion of the fair value of the elements delivered to the fair value of the overall contract.
Construction contracts Revenue from construction contracts for the Group this would include all infrastructure projects including ICT infrastructure is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific contract concerned.
Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours incurred, or earned value of work performed.
Profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Variations and claims are included where it is probable that the amount will be settled.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable that those costs will be recoverable.
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings.
Progress billings not yet paid by customers and retentions are included within trade and other receivables.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 75 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Equipment leasing income Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
vii Exceptional items Exceptional items are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in order to provide greater visibility of the underlying results of the business which the Board believes to be a more meaningful indication of ongoing operational performance.
viii Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as non-current or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance cost and the reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the period of the relevant committed lease period.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
ix Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences are not provided for as follows: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
x Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs, including interest costs incurred relating to qualifying assets.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Computer equipment 3 to 5 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Motor vehicles 4 to 10 years Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
The residual value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 76 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued xi Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
xii Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill is written down and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the estimated value in use.
Value in use is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Between 1998 and the Groups conversion to IFRS, goodwill was accounted for in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Groups opening goodwill balance on transition to IFRS took advantage of the transitional exemptions within IFRS 1. xiii Research costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
xiv Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and, from a business combination, are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Acquired software licences 25 years Brands 320 years Customer contracts and relationships Typically 410 years with a maximum of 30 years in respect of specific long-term relationships.
Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
xv Investment properties Land and buildings that are leased to non-Group entities are classified as investment properties.
The Group applies the cost model to measure investment properties at their cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of investment properties over their estimated useful lives of up to 50 years.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
xvi Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are tested for impairment when events occur, or circumstances indicate, that their carrying values may be impaired.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests.
Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset, or its cash-generating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 77 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued An assets recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
xvii Other investments The Group determines the classification of its other investments at initial recognition.
The classification depends upon the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Currently the Group has other investments designated as available-for-sale and loans and receivables.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade-date, namely the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit and loss.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.
xviii Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
xix Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses.
xx Cash, cash equivalents and net debt Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts repayable on demand.
The Group definition of net debt comprises cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable and amounts payable on interest bearing loans.
xxi Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS were deemed to be nil.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 78 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued xxii Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are categorised, depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired, on initial recognition as either: Assets held at fair value through profit or loss which are held for trading in the short-term and are classified as current assets: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets which are not quoted in an active market.
These are classified as current or non-current assets depending on maturity and included within trade and other receivables: Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed maturity dates which the Group intends to hold to maturity: or Available-for-sale financial assets which are non-derivative financial assets designated by management as available for sale and not falling into any of the above categories.
Financial liabilities are categorised on initial recognition as: Liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss which are held for trading in the short-term and are classified as current or non current liabilities depending on the maturity date of the instruments: or Other liabilities held at cost.
Derivatives are categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
When a financial asset or liability is recognised initially, it is measured at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are carried at cost, or amortised cost where applicable, using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss are stated at cost.
xxiii Derivative financial instruments The Group primarily uses foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised as they arise in the income statement.
xxiv Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which one party would assume the rights and or duties of another party.
The fair value of financial instruments has been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date.
Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Those quotes are back tested using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market-related data at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
xxv Hedge accounting For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
The Group currently only has designated cash flow hedges.
In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting such as a known foreign currency payment or a known interest payment, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising in fair value are taken directly to profit or loss for the year.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 79 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the year.
xxvi Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
The Group has certain borrowings relating to Private Finance Initiative PFI contracts where there is no recourse to the Group in the event of default.
Such loans, although recognised in full on the Groups balance sheet, are classified as non-recourse loans within the analysis of net debt provided.
xxvii Retirement benefit plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognised past service costs, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculations, together with the cost of providing benefits under the plans, are performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xxviii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
xxix Share-based payment transactions Share-based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the Groups share option, incentive and other award schemes.
Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the vesting period of the scheme, with a corresponding entry recorded within equity.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the vesting period and, in the case of non-market-related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
xxx Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that the total estimated contract costs will exceed the total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work in progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and as liability provisions for the remainder.
Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts which are updated regularly.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Provisions for restructuring or reorganisation are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced, or has been publicly announced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligation under the contract.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 80 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued xxxi Accounting for PFI contracts In determining an appropriate accounting policy for the Groups interests in PFI projects under Adopted IFRSs, the Group has considered the current status of the project by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC on accounting for service concession arrangements.
IFRIC published IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements in December 2006 which is generally applicable for accounting periods commencing after 1 January 2008.
However, IFRIC 12 was only endorsed by the EU during April 2009 and, as a consequence, a transitional provision is available to IFRS adopters in the EU to adopt for years commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The Group has opted not to adopt this pronouncement early and, for the year ended 31 March 2009, it has continued to apply elements of the approach set out in UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in accounting for its interests in PFI projects.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed.
Once the accounting model has been determined, the recognised assets and liabilities of the PFI projects are measured in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
The Group will be adopting IFRIC 12 for the year commencing 1 April 2009.
The Group expenses costs incurred in developing and competing for contracts up until a contract has achieved preferred bidder stage.
Costs incurred after preferred bidder status has been achieved are held on the balance sheet and recovered through contract activity.
Such costs are subject to review for impairment if there are indicators that they may not be recoverable.
xxxii Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area: or i s a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
xxxiii Assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying value will be recovered through disposal rather than continuing use within the business, the asset is available for sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable.
Following reclassification, non-current assets are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair values less costs to sell.
xxxiv Critical accounting policies An analysis and explanation of the Groups critical accounting policies used in producing this set of financial statements is made in the Financial review on pages 12 to 13 of the Annual report.
xxxv New standards and interpretations applied in these financial statements With effect from 1 April 2008, the Group adopted IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction which clarifies when refunds or reductions in future contributions in relations to defined benefit assets should be regarded as available and provides guidance on the impact of the minimum funding requirements on such assets.
This has had no impact on the reported results of the Group.
xxxvi New standards and interpretations applied next year At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective.
The following are likely to have an impact on the Groups results.
IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This will significantly change the recognition of goodwill, acquisition costs and contingent consideration relating to acquisitions.
However, it applies only to acquisitions made after it has been adopted.
IFRS 8 Operating segments, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This may change the way in which we report operating segments.
A detailed review of the impact of this standard is currently in progress.
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
A detailed review of the impact of this interpretation is in progress.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
A review of the impact of this interpretation is in progress.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 81 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The following remaining standards and interpretations are not expected to impact materially the Groups results.
IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and separate financial statements, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This will require a different accounting treatment for minority interest but it is not expected to affect the Groups financial results or position materially.
I FRS 2 Amendment Share-based payments, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This provides a definition of vesting conditions and specifies the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions.
It is not expected to affect materially the share-based payment charge recognised in the Group accounts.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of financial statements, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This changes the presentation requirements for other comprehensive income and transactions with shareholders and requires increased disclosures when there is a restatement of comparatives.
IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing costs, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This eliminates the option of expensing all borrowing costs when they are incurred.
IAS 32 Amendment Financial instruments: Presentation, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This clarifies the treatment of puttable financial instruments.
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 17 Distributions of non-cash assets to owners, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 82 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Segment reporting In accordance with IAS 14, segment information is presented in respect of the Groups business and geographical segments.
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
Secondary segment information is reported geographically.
The Groups geographical segments are based on the location of the Groups assets.
Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms-length basis.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between business segments.
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.
Changes in accounting presentation Following shareholder approval on 30 June 2008, the Group transferred its interests in naval shipbuilding and related support businesses, including its 50 per cent interest in Fleet Support Limited, to BVT Surface Fleet Limited BVT, a joint venture with BAE Systems plc, in consideration for a 45 per cent interest in BVT, and also acquired the remaining 50 per cent interest in Flagship Training Limited VT Flagship Limited which was previously a joint venture with BAE Systems plc.
As a consequence of these transactions the Group has reviewed the classification of its business segments previously reported in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008.
The key changes are as follows: The transfer of the businesses previously reported as VT Shipbuilding to the BVT Naval segment.
Amounts reported in this segment also include all amounts reported by BVT.
These businesses are now treated as a discontinued operation as detailed below.
The transfer of VT Naval Support businesses from the VT Support Services segment to the BVT Naval segment.
This business is now treated as a discontinued operation as detailed below.
The inclusion of VT Flagship Limited within the VT Education & Skills segment having been previously reported within the VT Support Services segment to reflect operational responsibility for the VT Flagship business.
The Group comprised the following main business segments: VT Communications provides critical communications services in the broadcast, defence, space, emergency services and security sectors worldwide.
VT Support Services provides technical services, logistics and training for commercial customers, government bodies and all three armed services in the UK and around the world.
Activities include facilities management, consultancy, operation and maintenance of assets, provision of specialist manpower, waste management, nuclear services and supply chain management.
VT Education & Skills provides a wide range of supporting services to schools, Local Education Authorities and central government, including careers guidance and the provision of vocational work-based training.
VT Services Inc provides a range of support service activities, including base operations, facilities management and the installation and support of communication systems.
This activity is primarily for the US Department of Defense.
Discontinued operations represent the Groups BVT Naval segment.
This includes the businesses constituting the VT Shipbuilding segment in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 including those businesses transferred to BVT Surface Fleet Limited BVT on 1 July 2008 and the Groups interest in BVT.
BVT designs and constructs advanced naval vessels for the Royal Navy and navies worldwide and provides related maintenance and support services.
The segments activities also include the design and manufacture of smaller craft and equipment for the marine, offshore and aerospace markets.
On 28 January 2009 the Group announced its intention to exercise its put option in relation to its shares in BVT, and this business has therefore been classified as discontinued in accordance with IFRS 5 see note 5.

In forming the joint venture the Group contributed net assets with a total net book value of 41.1m and incurred costs of 17.0m in completing the transaction.
The provisional fair value of net liabilities contributed by BAE was 66.8m.
The put option over the interests in the shares of the joint venture was valued at 6.2m on initial recognition.
Goodwill, representing the excess of 55 per cent of the fair value of the business contributed by VT Group and related transaction costs over 45 per cent of the fair value of the net liabilities contributed by BAE, of 163.9m, arose as a result of this transaction giving an initial joint venture carrying amount of 152.6m including the previously held interest in the Fleet Support joint venture of 2.7m.
An accounting gain arose from this transaction, representing the difference between the fair value of the total consideration received and the book value of the assets disposed, of 100.8m.
The total net book values of the VT Group net assets transferred at the date of the transaction were as follows: m Property, plant and equipment 62.4 Intangible assets including goodwill 4.5 Equity accounted investments 2.7 Inventories 0.5 Trade and other receivables 94.4 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 Trade and other payables 107.3 Provisions 1.3 Deferred tax 0.5 Employee benefits 14.8 Total net identifiable assets and liabilities transferred from VT Group to BVT joint venture 41.1 Accounting gain on assets contributed to BVT joint venture Fair value of consideration received including related put option 121.1 Share of net assets transferred 20.3 Gain arising 100.8 Interest in joint venture Fair value of consideration given including costs of transaction analysed as: Share of provisional fair value of interest in net assets acquired as a result of the transaction 30.1 Goodwill arising 163.9 133.8 Retained interest in assets and liabilities transferred to BVT joint venture 18.8 Total interest in joint ventures arising including previously held interest in Fleet Support Limited 152.6 Accounting for BVT Subsequent to the creation of BVT, the Group has equity accounted for its interest in BVT and 45 per cent of the share of the result of BVT is included within discontinued operations.
The Groups share of the result of BVT subsequent to its creation includes a charge of 24m, representing the Groups share of additional costs on certain export contracts contributed to the joint venture by VT Group.
The Directors estimate that these contracts will result in an overall loss to BVT of 54m based on the Boards experience of shipbuilding together with independent reviews performed by specialist consultants.
Inevitably there is a range of possible outcomes and the overall loss represents the Directors best estimate of losses based on information currently available.
The Directors have noted that BAE, in its annual report for the year ended 31 December 2008, reported loss provisions of 96m 53m at BAEs 55 per cent share through its fair value accounting, consistent with estimates provided by BVT management.
This loss provision, which has not been approved by the BVT Board, is outside the range which the Directors consider to be reasonably likely given available synergies and risk mitigation strategies.
The projected costs on these contracts continue to be updated by BVT management.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 89 5 Discontinued operations continued Negotiations are at an early stage with BAE in relation to these export contracts and a possible injection of capital by VT Group into the BVT business in a form which will not impact the existing equity holdings or management rights.
Any such injection of capital would, however, result in an exceptional charge being recorded within discontinued operations in the period in which made.
Whilst it is possible that an injection of capital may be made, the Directors do not believe it appropriate to make any provision for such injection at this stage, nor, given the circumstances, is it practicable to estimate reliably the amount of any such contribution.
Accounting for discontinued operations On 28 January 2009, the Group announced its intention to exercise the put option, which enables the Group to put its 45 per cent shareholding in BVT to BAE for a minimum exit price of 380m, subject to specific adjustments downwards in respect of pension liabilities, notional interest on BAE loans to BVT and certain other items.
Exercise of the put option requires UK Ministry of Defence MoD approval, in addition to approval by the Groups shareholders and other regulatory bodies.
The Group has been advised by the MoD that it has approved the exercise of the put option subject to finalising the details of the 15-year Terms of Business Agreement.
The Group expects to exercise the put option around 1 July 2009.
On completion of the sale of its interest in BVT to BAE, VT Group will have exited its shipbuilding and naval support business and accordingly the Group has presented these as a discontinued operation.
The profit from discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2009 therefore represents the results of BVT, together with the results of the VT Shipbuilding business prior to its contribution to BVT on 1 July 2008, and the results of Motion Control Group including its loss on disposal.
Motion Control Group was primarily involved in the provision of stabilizers to the shipbuilding industry.
Comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2008 have been restated.
The results of the discontinued operations are set out below.

These are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in order to provide greater visibility of the underlying results of the business, which the Board believes to be a more meaningful indication of ongoing operational performance.
An analysis of the exceptional items included within the income statement is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Accounted for in arriving at Group operating profit: Reorganisation and restructuring costs 24.7 - Increase to provision relating to historic asbestos exposure 8.0 - Profit arising from disposal of properties 4.4 - Net non-recurring and restructuring gains included in arriving at operating profit from continuing operations 28.3 - Taxation arising on exceptional items 9.3 - Exceptional tax charge in respect of legislation change relating to industrial buildings allowances 1.7 - 7.6 - Post-tax exceptional items from continuing operations 20.7 - Following the formation of BVT, the Group is reorganising and restructuring its remaining services activities, including the integration of VT Flagship into the Group.
This programme has begun and will continue into the next financial year.
The total cost of this reorganisation programme is estimated at 24.7m.
Upon formation of BVT it was agreed that the Group would remain responsible for all retrospective asbestos claims from VT Group employees.
A reassessment of the provision for asbestos exposures has been made during the year with the assistance of specialist advisors and adopting current assumptions in relation to recent claims experience and mortality data.
As a result of this exercise the provision relating to these claims was increased during the year by 8.0m.
During the period the Group disposed of surplus properties for proceeds of 9.6m in cash, giving rise to a profit of 4.4m.
In addition to the taxation effect on the items described above, there is a one-off taxation charge arising in the current year of 1.7m associated with the UK Governments abolition of industrial buildings allowances, which is a non-cash adjustment to deferred tax balances within the financial statements.

VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 95 13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Goodwill of 21.5m was recognised at 31 March 2008 based on provisional fair values.
During the year the fair values were finalised and in accordance with IFRS 3, an increase to goodwill of 3.3m has been made as outlined in note 2 to the financial statements.
In addition the Group negotiated a revised overall reduction in the purchase consideration of 6.4m.
The Group also acquired Advanced Engineering and Planning Corporation VT Aepco during the previous financial year.
The purchase consideration in respect of this acquisition was subject to certain performance criteria.
During the current financial year the performance criteria have exceeded the original expectations and as such an additional consideration of 0.9m has become payable.
Goodwill has been allocated to the following significant cash-generating units: 2009 2008 as restated m m UK VT Communications 79.1 79.1 VT Aerospace 27.2 27.2 VT Training 20.2 20.2 VT Flagship 41.6 - VT Land 21.3 21.3 VT Nuclear Services 18.4 24.8 US VT Griffin 27.7 24.8 VT Milcom 20.5 15.4 VT Aepco 33.8 23.4 Other cash-generating units 13.5 17.9 Total goodwill 303.3 254.1 The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 10 per cent to 14 per cent 2008: 10 per cent to 13 per cent and cash flow projections beyond the five-year forecast were extrapolated using a 2.5 per cent growth rate 2008: 2.5 per cent.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: Cash flow projections: Discount rates: and Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
Cash flow projections are based on the financial plans approved by the Board as part of the Groups medium-term strategy planning, excluding any possible future acquisition plans.
These plans consist of a one-year detailed budget and future forecasts for the following four years.
Cash flow projections are also compared to historic performance as part of this planning process.
Discount rates reflect the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to certain cash-generating units.
Growth rate estimates are based on published information in respect of long-term growth rates and are appropriate for all of the Groups cash-generating units because they operate in similar economic environments.
The impairment review as required by IAS 36 has been undertaken at 31 March 2009 and no impairment loss has been recognised.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

The goodwill recognised on acquisition is principally attributable to the skills and technical talent of the acquired businesses workforce, synergies expected to be derived from the acquisition and those other assets not requiring valuation under IFRS 3.
Contingent consideration of 10.0m may be payable or receivable under the terms of the acquisition, depending on the renewal of certain contracts held by VT Flagship Limited.
The Board has estimated the level of contingent consideration at nil.
From the date of acquisition, VT Flagship contributed a profit before tax of 15.7m excluding the effect of intangible amortisation arising from business combinations to the Groups results.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit before tax excluding the effects of intangible amortisation arising from business combinations would have increased by 1.5m and revenue from continuing operations would have increased by 18.8m.

From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2008, VT Nuclear Services contributed an operating profit of nil to the results of the Group, after incurring a restructuring charge following the acquisition of 1m.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit before tax of the Group would have been increased by 4.8m and revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by 57.7m.
In addition, the Group negotiated a revised overall reduction in the purchase consideration of 6.4m during the year ended 31 March 2009 which has resulted in a further adjustment to goodwill in that period.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the Group has reassessed the provisional fair values and purchase consideration in respect of the acquisition of VT Nuclear Services made in the prior financial year.
As a result of this reassessment, goodwill arising from the transaction has been increased by 3.3m from that previously assessed.
These adjustments are reflected in the table above.

The goodwill recognised on acquisition represents the value of those assets not requiring valuation under IFRS 3 and the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the company into the Groups existing business.
From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2008, VT Aepco Inc contributed an operating profit of 0.9m to the results of the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit before tax of the Group would have been increased by 0.3m and revenue from continuing operations would have increased by 27.6m.

31 Capital management and financial risks The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework, including relevant policies and procedures, including a Group finance manual and a Group treasury manual.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit which reports results of its findings to the Committee.
Additional disclosure is included in the Key risks and uncertainties section of this annual report and capital management disclosures are provided in the Financial review.
The Groups treasury policies, which have been approved by the Board, set out the basis and framework under which the Group manages financial risk.
The policies cover all significant areas of treasury activity including capital management, liquidity risk, counterparty and credit risk and market risk including interest rate and foreign currency risk.
Overview of financial risks This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the following risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the consolidated financial statements.
Capital management The Group manages capital to ensure that it has available resources and access to markets to ensure the continued growth of the Group and to meet short-term borrowing requirements.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure that complies with loan covenants and other measures.
Access to capital takes many forms and includes, but is not limited to, equity markets, debt capital markets and bank markets.
The Group monitors capital, on a short and medium term basis with short-term being one year or less and medium-term being up to five years, on the basis of a number of financial ratios generally used by industry and by the rating agencies.
This includes monitoring gearing ratios, interest cover and cash conversion ratios.
The Groups capital structure is managed against the various financial ratios as required to ensure that it has sufficient financial resources to support the business, whilst also maintaining a comfortable level of headroom under its facilities and remaining within its financial covenants.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase shares, issue debt or repay debt.
During 2009, the Group maintained sufficient debt facilities which ensured its objectives were met.

Investment of surplus funds is carefully controlled with defined policies in place over institutions within which investments can be placed.
Authorisation procedures for investment are in place across the Group including Board approval where appropriate.
In its funding strategy, the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, loan notes and finance leases.
To meet this objective, the Groups policy is to ensure that adequate unutilised committed funding facilities are available to cover authorised capital expenditure commitments, debt due for repayment within one year and an appropriate level of headroom.
Surplus cash is invested only in financial institutions with high credit ratings and in financial instruments exposed to insignificant risk of changes in market value, with not less than 50 per cent of surplus funds available invested with maturities of three months or less.
Funds may not be invested for periods of greater than one year.
The table below analyses the maturity profile of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities.
The proceeds arising from the sale of the Groups interest in BVT will fund the payment of deferred consideration.
Uncommitted borrowing facilities At 31 March 2009 the Group had available 175m 2008: 160m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
80m of these facilities fall for review in March 2011 and the remainder is available until November 2011. Credit risk The risk of financial loss due to a counter-partys failure to honour its obligations arises principally in relation to transactions where the Group provides goods and services on deferred terms, enters into derivative contracts requiring settlement by the other party or invests or deposits surplus cash.
Group policies are aimed at minimising such losses and require that deferred terms are granted only to customers who demonstrate an appropriate payment history and satisfy creditworthiness procedures.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Group policies also restrict the counterparties with which derivative transactions can be contracted and funds may be invested to those approved by the treasury team and approved by the Board, comprising banks and financial institutions with a high credit rating.
The treasury team ensures that there is no undue concentration risk and that exposure is spread across a number of approved financial institutions.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 113 31 Capital management and financial risks continued The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk in respect of concentrations of trade receivables is limited due to the Groups customer base being typically government with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are also monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
Further information regarding the Groups credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables is detailed in note 24.
The Group has not pledged any assets in respect of any of its primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities, except as disclosed in note 15.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
The Group buys or sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set out in the Group treasury manual.
The Group seeks to apply hedge accounting to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk Group policy is to manage the cost of borrowing using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
Whilst fixed rate interest-bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling.
In addition, the fair value risk inherent in fixed-rate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt be restructured or repaid early.
In contrast, whilst floating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash flow risk as costs increase if market rates rise.
The Group has no absolute policy towards either fixed-rate finance or floating-rate finance.
The proportions of interest-rate exposure that should be fixed and the proportion that should be floating will be dictated by the nature and terms of the underlying asset s and contract s being funded.
The exact proportion will be determined by current economic conditions, the currency in which the debt is denominated and the purposes and duration of the debt.
The Group uses various long and short-term borrowings, principally in US dollars and UK sterling generally at floating rates of interest.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to acquire interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
The Group uses interest rate swaps agreed with other parties to generate the desired interest profile, agreeing to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal.
At the year end, 37 per cent 2008: 11 per cent of the Groups borrowings was at fixed rates including deferred consideration in respect of the VT Flagship acquisition, after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt at 31 March was as follows: 31 March 2009 Effective Within More than interest rate 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bank loans: Non-recourse 6.2 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.6 1.8 12.6 20.2 Other loans 6.3 68.1 - - - - 1.8 69.9 69.5 1.4 1.4 1.6 1.8 14.4 90.1 Floating rate Cash and cash equivalents 51.5 - - - - - 51.5 Loan to joint venture 12.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.8 3.0 5.8 Loan notes 3.1 0.4 - - - - - 0.4 Finance leases 2.3 10.2 10.6 - - - - 20.8 Revolving credit facility 2.4 - - 57.5 - - - 57.5 Revolving credit facility US $ 1.0 - - 72.4 - - - 72.4 Loan from joint venture 0.0 2.5 - - - - - 2.5 38.9 10.1 129.4 0.5 0.8 3.0 96.3 Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 114 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Capital management and financial risks continued 31 March 2008 Effective Within More than interest rate 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bank loans: Non-recourse 6.2 1.1 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 14.1 20.0 Recourse US $ 6.0 0.1 - - - - - 0.1 Other loans 6.5 - - - - - 1.8 1.8 1.2 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 15.9 21.9 Floating rate Cash and cash equivalents 60.1 - - - - - 60.1 Loan to associate 12.0 0.1 - - - - - 0.1 Other loans receivable 6.0 0.2 - - - - - 0.2 Loan notes 5.1 0.4 - - - - - 0.4 Finance leases 5.6 9.7 10.4 10.4 - - - 30.5 Revolving credit facility 6.1 - - - 88.6 - - 88.6 Revolving credit facility US $ 3.0 - - - 56.6 - - 56.6 Loan from joint venture 5.6 7.3 - - - - - 7.3 43.0 10.4 10.4 145.2 - - 123.0 A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 2.0m 2008: 1.8m.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells goods and services denominated in currencies other than sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-sterling revenues, purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash flows can be affected significantly by movements in exchange rates, particularly in the US dollar and Euro.
Group policy is to finance, so far as practicable, the costs of acquisition and new business opportunities by matching borrowings in the local currency in order to eliminate foreign exchange transaction exposure, provided that the benefits are not outweighed by the overall cost of the borrowing.
The Groups transactional currency exposure arises from sales or purchases by certain operating units in currencies other than its functional currency.
It is the Groups policy not to enter into forward contracts for purchases until there is a high degree of certainty.
In addition, the Groups treasury policy is to hedge if and when a significant exposure is recognised, through the use of foreign currency instruments, to manage the currency exposures on transactions for which revenue or payment is anticipated.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows: 2009 2008 US$m 7m OMRm US$m 5m OMRm Monetary assets 88.3 6.9 2.8 64.7 11.4 2.5 Monetary liabilities 161.3 1.1 0.1 51.0 1.2 0.1 Gross balance sheet exposure 73.0 5.8 2.7 13.7 10.2 2.4 The major currency in which the Group trades in overseas operations is the US dollar.
A 10 per cent movement in the US dollar:sterling exchange rate from the year average rate of 1.70192 2008: 2.0133 would have changed the reported Group profit after taxation by 0.3m 2008: 0.2m.
Other market price risk The Group enters into certain commodity contracts, all of which are in order to fix the price of certain commodities such as electricity and oil on a long-term basis in order to ensure certainty of cash flow in those contracts.
These contracts meet the own use exemption within IAS 39 and therefore the fair value is not required to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 115 32 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group currently only holds instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups accounting policies detail the approach to the adoption of hedge accounting.

In addition 202,394 2008: 236,679 shares were issued to the employee trust to satisfy future pending awards under the Companys share schemes.
35 Share-based payments Employee and management share participation plans exist as follows.
All plans are equity-settled except for an element of the Deferred annual bonus scheme.
New awards are no longer made under the long-term incentive or share option plans.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was established as an incentive scheme for executive Directors and certain other senior executives.
Under the terms of the scheme, employees were awarded shares equal in value up to 50 per cent of basic salary.
The grant of awards was at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to achievement of the performance target.
The performance criterion is the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the comparator Group which currently comprises the members of the FTSE 250 but excluding investment trusts.
Shares vest fully if the Groups performance equals the upper quartile of the comparator Group but there is no vesting if performance is below the median.
Deferred annual bonus scheme DABS The Group operates a DABS for senior executives.
Under the provisions of the scheme members are required to defer 40 per cent of their annual bonus which is used to acquire shares to that value.
In addition, employees have the option to defer a further portion of annual bonus to acquire additional shares, up to a maximum of 35 per cent of annual bonus.
The deferred shares are held in trust for a period of three years.
At the end of the three-year period employees will receive these shares together with a matching element from the Company.
The quantum of the matching element depends on the achievement of earnings per share growth targets.
The maximum matching element obtainable is three times the deferred shares originally held for an employee.
Share option plans The Group operates two share option plans under which Directors and other executives were eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options were granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Share options vest in equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the grant subject to achievement of the performance condition.
The performance condition applied was a real growth in earnings per share of at least 2 per cent per annum over three consecutive years.
These share options have a maximum life of 10 years.
Share incentive plan SIP The Group operates a SIP open to all employees.
Under the SIP employees are granted share options subject to the Group meeting certain profit targets.
Options are granted at the market value on the date of the award and vest unconditionally if the employee remains in service for a period of three-years from the date of the award.
The contractual life of the options is five years and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Performance Share Plan PSP During the year the Group launched the PSP.
Under this scheme certain employees are granted nil cost options which vest after a three-year performance period, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment.
Awards are subject to two performance conditions being either the Groups earnings per share growth or the relative TSR.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 118 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Share-based payments continued Employee Share Option Savings Plans ESOPs The Group operates ESOPs for all eligible employees, whereby employees can save towards the exercise price payable for an award of share options.
The exercise price of these options is set at 90 per cent of the market value of the share price at the date of grant.
Under awards granted by the Group, the savings period is either three or five years for UK-based employees and two years for US-based employees.
At the end of the savings period, the options vest and the option holders have a six-month window in which to exercise their options.
The following tables set out share-option activity under these plans illustrating the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.
All remaining awards fall due for release in July 2009.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 6.13 2008: 5.98.
For options outstanding at 31 March 2009 the weighted average remaining contractual life was 4.7 years 2008: 5.4 years.

Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 120 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Share-based payments continued Share option valuation assumptions The fair value of options granted were measured using the Black-Scholes method for the share option plans and ESOPs, the Monte-Carlo method for the grants under the LTIP and PSP scheme, and a simplified Black-Scholes method for the matching shares granted within the LTIP.
The weighted average assumptions used in determining fair value of options granted in the year were as follows: PSP 2009 2008 Expected volatility 24.0% 21.1% Risk-free interest rate 4.6% 5.2% Expected life 3 years 3 years The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options.
The expected life of the options is the Groups best estimate of exercise patterns based on current available data.
The LTIP includes a market vesting condition linked to the TSR of a comparator group which requires the volatility of comparator companies share prices and the average correlation between the share prices of the Company and the comparator companies to be considered in assessing the fair value of options granted.
The following approach has been adopted for these items: Comparator company volatility annualised, daily historic volatility assessed over a period prior to the date of grant that corresponds to the period over which the TSR is being projected Company correlation taken as the average correlation of TSR between all of the companies over the same historic period In respect of the DABS and SIP schemes, awards are measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares at the date of grant, which is considered to be the market price, with a discount if appropriate to reflect that the awards do not carry dividend rights.

40 Contingent liabilities At 31 March 2009, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business entered into for, or on behalf of, certain Group and joint venture undertakings.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements or within those of the relevant subsidiary.
Details regarding BVT Surface Fleet are set out in note 5.
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability exists at the year end.
The Company and a number of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 124 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 41 Retirement benefits The Group participates in six defined benefit pension schemes: the Shipbuilding Industries Scheme SIPS : four education related schemes Citrus formerly LAWDC, the Guidance Enterprise Group Scheme, the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS and the Nuclear industry scheme ESPS : and a US scheme.
The UK schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered funds.
The US scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The Group holds a life assurance policy which is to be used to fund retirement benefits arising.
Under IAS 19 this insurance policy is deemed to be a non-qualifying insurance policy and as such is not an asset of the pension scheme.
The asset is instead a corporate-owned asset and is included within the balance sheet note 21.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes at 31 March were: Year ended 31 March 2009 SIPS US Other Total m m m m Scheme assets at fair value Equities 180.6 - 26.4 207.0 Bonds 38.9 - 7.2 46.1 Other 9.2 - 3.2 12.4 Fair value of scheme assets 228.7 - 36.8 265.5 Present value of scheme obligations 278.7 0.3 47.0 326.0 Net pension liability 50.0 0.3 10.2 60.5 Year ended 31 March 2008 SIPS US Other Total m m m m Scheme assets at fair value Equities 251.7 - 37.7 289.4 Bonds 32.7 - 8.4 41.1 Other 11.7 - 4.5 16.2 Fair value of scheme assets 296.1 - 50.6 346.7 Present value of scheme obligations 305.5 0.2 50.7 356.4 Net pension liability 9.4 0.2 0.1 9.7 The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.

For the main SIPS scheme the actuarial table used is PA 92, which allows for expected increases in longevity.
The table has been adjusted for deferred members and pensioners to reflect actual scheme experience.
In addition the mortality assumption includes a short cohort effect 2008: short cohort effect reflecting improved longevity of members born between 1925 and 1945.
The inclusion of this cohort effect strengthens the mortality assumption within the actuarial calculation.
The mortality assumption reflects the assumption adopted in the latest actuarial funding valuation of the scheme undertaken at 31 March 2007.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male 2008: 65 year old would have a life expectancy to age 85 2008: 85 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 87 2008: 87.
The effect of increasing this assumed life expectancy by one year is predicted to increase the deficit in the schemes by approximately 9m 2008: 9m.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate were to change by 0.1 per cent then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by 9m 2008: 7m.

2 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the going concern basis as detailed in note 2 of the Group IFRS financial statements.
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 from the requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption available under FRS 8 not to disclose details of transactions with other Group undertakings as the consolidated financial statements are shown on pages 68 to 129.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that in the opinion of the Directors, there is a reasonable probability that the asset will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less any provisions for impairment in value.
Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life as follows: Computer software 3 to 5 years Current asset investments Current asset investments relate to investments which will be recovered through disposal rather than continuing use within the business.
Current asset investments are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and net realisable value.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments Although the Company does not incur a charge under FRS 20, the issuance by the Company to its subsidiaries of a grant over the Companys options represents additional capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries.
An additional investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grant issued allocated over the underlying grants vesting period.
3 Profit and loss account disclosures The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account or statement of total recognised gains and losses as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
