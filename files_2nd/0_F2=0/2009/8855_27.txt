Information on the directors remuneration is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 53.
13 Share-based payments Share options Equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and are subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employees salary and from 2001 to 2006 approximately 800 employees were granted options each year.
In 2007 a new long term incentive plan was introduced and allocations of shares under this plan replaced the granting of share options.
No share options were granted in the years ended 31st March 2008 and 2009.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 are subject to a minimum three year performance target of earnings per share EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets are EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets are not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options will lapse.
The targets for options granted in 2004 and 2005 have been met and so these options are exercisable.
Also, gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the options.
They are subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Since the targets have been met all these options are exercisable.
Some options granted in 2000 and before are still outstanding.
These were subject to a performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 2% over the three year performance period.
Since that target has been met all these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The new LTIP also replaced share allocations made under the previous LTIP.
Under the new LTIP, shares are allocated to approximately 800 employees based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period.
At 31st March 2009, shares allocated in 2007 and 2008 at 31st March 2008, shares allocated in 2007 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to the achievement of a EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period.
For the maximum release of 100% of the allocation, EPS must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if the EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the three year performance period.
Under the previous LTIP, shares were allocated to directors and certain key executives of the group based upon a percentage of salary and are subject to performance conditions over a three year period.
At 31st March 2009, shares allocated in 2006 at 31st March 2008, shares allocated in 2005 and 2006 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The release of shares is subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR compared to those companies ranked 51 to 150 in the FTSE index over a three year period.
All shares are released if the company ranks in the 76th percentile or above.
None of the shares are released if the company ranks in the 50th percentile or below.
If the company ranks between these percentiles 35% to 100% of the shares are released on a straight line basis.
In addition EPS growth must be at least equal to UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three year performance period before any release is made.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK and overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The SIP trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the employees contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are allocated to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the Overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.

They are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
The total expense recognised during the year in respect of equity settled share-based payments, taking into account expected lapses due to leavers and the probability that EPS performance conditions will not be met, was 5.6 million 2008 9.8 million.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 - 73 ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2009 14 Post-employment benefits 14a Group The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 2.5 million 2008 3.1 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The pension plans are final salary plans except for the new section of the UK plan which is a career average salary plan and the US hourly plan which is a fixed benefit based upon years of service.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2006 for the main UK pension plan and 30th June 2008 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2009 by qualified independent actuaries.
The main assumptions were: 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 UK plans US plans Other plans UK plans US plans Other plans %%% % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.75 2.88 5.00 4.25 2.91 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00 2.04 3.50 2.20 Discount rate 6.50 6.40 5.87 6.50 6.50 5.45 Inflation 3.00 2.75 2.02 3.50 2.75 1.57 Current medical benefits cost trend rate 7.00 9.00 4.00 7.50 8.00 4.00 Ultimate medical benefits cost trend rate 7.00 5.00 4.00 7.50 5.00 4.00 The group uses certain mortality assumptions when calculating plan obligations.
The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The mortality tables used for the groups largest plan, which is in the UK, at its last full actuarial valuation were PMA92C2006 with a one and a half years positive age rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2006 with a one and a half years positive age rating for female members retiring in normal health.
Allowance for future mortality improvements was made in line with the medium cohort versions of these tables.
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health.

Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2009 2008 2009 2008 restated million million million million Environmental Technologies Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 90.7 77.8 Process Technologies 231.9 223.0 132.4 132.4 Precious Metal Products 5.3 4.2 Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Macfarlan Smith 117.1 117.1 117.1 Catalysts and Chemicals 26.9 19.6 Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 22.8 17.4 Research Chemicals 21.3 21.3 516.0 480.4 132.4 249.5 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period except as discussed below.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the tax rate and risk applicable to each CGU.
Following the acquisition of Argillon Group in February 2008, its business and technologies have been integrated into Emission Control Technologies existing non-light duty catalyst businesses to form a new Non-light Duty Catalysts CGU.
Over the next decade management expects the markets for heavy duty diesel catalysts and stationary emissions catalysts will grow significantly, based on emission control legislation already in place or anticipated, as described on page 18 of the Business Review.
For the Non-light Duty Catalysts CGU five year plans have been approved by management.
The cash flow projections have been extrapolated using a long term average growth rate of 3% 2008 10% and then discounted to the present value using a 12.0% discount rate 2008 11.3%.
The impairment test results in headroom of more than 30% over the carrying value of the CGUs net assets and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
84 - Johnson Matthey NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2009 16 Goodwill continued For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate used was 3% 2008 8% and the discount rate was 11.4% 2008 11.3%.
The impairment test results in headroom of 50% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Macfarlan Smith the long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2008 5% and the discount rate was 10.3% 2008 11.3%.
The impairment test results in headroom of approximately 20% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Catalysts and Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 2% 2008 5% and the discount rate was 11.4% 2008 11.3%.
The impairment test results in headroom of more than 100% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Pharmaceutical Materials and Pharma Services have been reorganised.
Pharmaceutical Materials and Services is now run as one business and so is one CGU.
The fine chemical manufacturing facility in Ireland is in the process of being closed with prostaglandin product manufacturing being consolidated at Pharmaceutical Materials and Services facility in the USA.
The long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2008 5% and the discount rate was 11.4% 2008 11.3%.
The resulting headroom exceeds the carrying value of the net assets by 40% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Research Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2008 5% and the discount rate was 10.7% 2008 11.3%.

Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
29a Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges as they hedge the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bonds attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cash flows are expected to occur in 2010 and 2015 when the respective bonds which they hedge mature.
The interest element of the cash flow hedges is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2010 and 2015.
At 31st March 2009, 63% 2008 30% of the groups net debt and 55% 2008 30% of the parent companys net debt were at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.13% 2008 5.20%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have a 2.0 million 2008 4.3 million impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
29b Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
At 31st March 2009 the group and parent company had borrowings under committed bank facilities of nil 2008 230.7 million.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.

Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
At 31st March 2009 trade receivables for the group amounted to 408.2 million 2008 568.9 million parent company 160.4 million 2008 234.1 million.
224.8 million 2008 382.5 million of these receivables at group level 106.1 million 2008 161.5 million at parent company level arose in Emission Control Technologies ECT which is part of Environmental Technologies Division and mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and truck manufacturers and component suppliers.
Although ECT has a wide spread of the available customers the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large.
The groups exposure to Chrysler LLC, which filed under Chapter 11 in the US Bankruptcy Court on 30th April 2009, was less than US $5 million, some of which was covered by insurance and indemnities from other suppliers.
The groups exposure to General Motors Corporation in the USA is very small.
Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed tend to be lower.
As at 31st March 2009 and at 31st March 2008 for the group as a whole, no single outstanding balance exceeded 1% of the groups revenue.
No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the groups and parent companys customers are obtained from credit rating agencies and closely monitored.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which the group operates are made promptly.
Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
Trade receivables can be analysed as: Group Parent company 2009 2008 2009 2008 million million million million Amounts neither past due nor impaired 333.3 494.7 143.7 210.8 Amounts past due but not impaired less than 30 days 52.7 53.0 14.3 16.0 30 90 days 12.8 13.3 2.9 5.4 more than 90 days 8.2 8.4 0.1 2.0 Total past due but not impaired 73.7 74.7 17.3 23.4 Amounts impaired 12.2 5.7 2.8 1.2 Specific allowances for bad and doubtful debts 9.2 5.5 2.2 1.1 Carrying amount of impaired receivables 3.0 0.2 0.6 0.1 General allowances for bad and doubtful debts 1.8 0.7 1.2 0.2 Trade receivables net of allowances 408.2 568.9 160.4 234.1 Movements in the allowances for impairments were: Group Parent company 2009 2008 2009 2008 million million million million At beginning of year 6.2 4.0 1.3 0.9 Charge for year 5.3 2.3 2.7 0.4 Release 0.7 0.1 Utilised 1.3 0.2 0.3 Disposal of business to subsidiary 0.2 Exchange adjustments 1.5 0.1 At end of year 11.0 6.2 3.4 1.3 Financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are banks with high credit ratings.
As at 31st March 2009, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 18.9 million 2008 36.3 million for the group and 9.8 million 2008 13.0 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for derivative financial instruments to a single bank was 16.5 million 2008 1.8 million for the group and parent company.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the groups and parent companys maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
The group guarantees its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associate and its exposure at 31st March 2009 was nil 2008 1.1 million.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2009 was 20.9 million 2008 62.1 million.

It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the groups unquoted available-for-sale investments which have a book value of 6.3 million 2008 5.2 million as there is no active market.
These are investments in a company that is in the start up phase and in an investment vehicle that invests in start up companies and so there is a wide range of possible values.
Given their size it would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
29e Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA, Europe and Japan 2008 USA, Europe, Japan and China by borrowing US dollars, euros and yen 2008 and renminbi respectively.
Although much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The group has designated the currency swaps, one euro loan and some of the US dollar bonds fair value of the loan and bonds was 298.5 million 2008 18.1 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.
The main currencies of the net debt after taking into account the effect of the currency swaps were: Group Group Parent company Parent company Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 million million million million million million million million Sterling 120.6 130.7 184.5 177.5 120.7 126.8 183.6 173.3 US dollar 288.7 166.7 39.2 13.9 285.0 157.5 22.1 5.6 Euro 411.5 421.6 442.1 446.9 Japanese yen 48.4 58.3 50.7 61.8 South African rand 48.5 7.5 5.9 5.5 Hong Kong dollar 56.1 26.2 47.9 11.8 Canadian dollar 25.4 7.3 23.3 7.1 Chinese renminbi 0.8 16.0 6.3 2.1 6.0 Swiss franc 11.4 7.3 9.4 0.9 Other currencies 10.4 17.9 15.6 15.0 1.6 9.4 2.8 0.8 880.4 859.7 346.0 249.3 906.0 813.9 289.1 199.5 The group and parent company use forward exchange contracts, and occasionally currency options, to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2010.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 8.6 cent 2008 10.0 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 3.2 million 2008 3.6 million impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 6.0 cent 2008 7.1 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 1.3 million 2008 1.7 million impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 - 93 ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2009 29 Financial risk management continued 29e Foreign currency risk continued For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast receipts and payments.
A 5% 7.2 cent 2008 9.9 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 3.7 million 2008 1.9 million impact on operating profit and a 19.1 million 2008 11.4 million impact on equity for these instruments.
A 5% 5.4 cent 2008 6.3 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 6.7 million 2008 2.4 million impact on operating profit and a 28.8 million 2008 28.0 million impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact in operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items.
Similarly, the impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries net assets and so would be offset by an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries net assets.
The remaining impact on equity of 6.6 million 2008 3.7 million for the US dollar and 8.1 million 2008 6.7 million for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
29f Capital management The groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The group has a long term target range for gearing net debt equity of 50% to 60% although in any given year gearing may fall outside this range depending on future plans.
See the section on capital structure in the Financial Review on page 14 for more information.

The fair value of the assets acquired were 0.3 million for customer relationships, 0.5 million for plant and machinery and 0.6 million for inventory.
Since it was acquired close to the end of the year, its contribution to the groups profit for the year was nil.
It is included in Precious Metal Products.
Alfa Aesar China Limiteds minority interest On 2nd March 2009 the group acquired the 49% of Alfa Aesar China Limited it did not already own for 5.2 million.
This has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 - 101 ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2009 40 Acquisitions continued Argillon Group acquired in the year ended 31st March 2008 On 6th February 2008 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Argillon Group Argillon.
Argillon specialises in catalysts and advanced ceramic materials and sells a range of products into a number of different industries.
The goodwill arising was attributable to the synergistic opportunity to take the existing Argillon technology together with Johnson Mattheys capital resources, technological expertise and commercial teams in businesses across the world, to develop new products to service new markets.
There have also been synergies in combining the group and Argillons complementary catalyst operations.
The acquisition of Argillon adds valuable technology to Johnson Mattheys existing emission control capabilities for controlling oxides of nitrogen NOx.
As well as products for the heavy duty diesel HDD truck market, Argillon manufactures catalysts for power plants, industrial applications and waste incineration plants.
These products have application in coal fired power stations to reduce harmful NOx emissions.
This could become a major market in a few years time as coal is increasingly used to produce electricity and people around the world become more concerned about air quality.
The acquisition of Argillon also adds to Emission Control Technologies existing business selling NOx control systems for large stationary engines and in marine applications.
Johnson Matthey estimates that the HDD catalyst market for mobile applications will grow from approximately US $600 million of sales excluding precious metals in 2008 to US $2.5 billion by the end of 2014 driven by legislation requiring much reduced levels of emissions which is due to come into force over the next five years.
Argillons products can be used to meet some of these legislative standards but they are more likely to be used in combination with other technology which has been developed by Johnson Matthey.
By combining Argillons and Johnson Mattheys technology, testing facilities and global sales capability sales of Argillons products are likely to be significantly higher than Argillon could achieve on its own.
In addition, in the next decade the board believes there will be significant opportunities for new products for NOx control to meet standards yet to be promulgated given global concerns about air quality and global warming.
The combination of Argillons and Johnson Mattheys technology and research and development capabilities should provide significantly better opportunities for developing successful products for these markets than the sum of the two businesses on a stand alone basis.
When the accounting records of the Insulators and Alumina businesses were separated from the other Argillon businesses it was found that the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities immediately prior to acquisition had been incorrectly allocated between the businesses.
Also, at acquisition it was assumed that the buildings at the German site were to be finance leased to the Insulators and Alumina businesses but this was changed to an operating lease.
This changes the fair values at acquisition and the goodwill on acquisition which was disclosed in last years accounts as 72.5 million and as a result the balance sheet at 31st March 2008 has been restated.

The group controls Hero and so it is accounted for as a subsidiary.
The fair value of the assets acquired were 0.1 million for a customer contract, 0.1 million for plant and equipment and 0.3 million for cash.
The minority interest was 0.2 million, giving goodwill of 0.1 million.
From acquisition to 31st March 2008 it contributed 0.1 million to the groups profit for the year and its results are included in Environmental Technologies.
41 Discontinued operations The results of the discontinued operations included in the consolidated income statement were: 2009 2008 million million Profit of the Insulators and Alumina businesses 0.9 0.3 Costs accrued on disposal of Ceramics Division 0.3 Profit for the year from discontinued operations 1.2 0.3 On the 26th November 2008 the group sold its non-core Insulators and Alumina businesses, that it acquired as part of the Argillon Group in February 2008, to Lapp Insulator GmbH & Co.
These businesses had been classified as held for sale since acquisition.
The proceeds received were 20.1 million in cash and a 1.7 million loan note.
On 28th February 2007 the group sold its Ceramics Division and costs were accrued at that time.
0.2 million of those costs were paid in the year ended 31st March 2009 and a further 0.3 million will not be incurred and so the accrual for these has been released.

The fair value exercise for this acquisition has not yet been completed.
44 Key sources of estimation uncertainty Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The group and parent company have made appropriate estimates when applying the accounting policies, but the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post-employment benefits The groups and parent companys defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified independent actuaries.
The details of the plans and assumptions used are described in note 14.
Goodwill The group has capitalised goodwill of 516.0 million and the parent company has 132.4 million.
Annual impairment reviews are performed which require various assumptions.
More details are given in note 16.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets which are not yet being amortised note 17 are also subject to annual impairment reviews based on discounted cash flow projections.
No impairment has been found.
Provisions and contingent liabilities As described in note 30 and the accounting policies, the group and parent company measure provisions and contingent liabilities at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date.
Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine the tax charge included in the accounts.
If the tax eventually payable or reclaimable differs from the amounts originally estimated then the difference will be charged or credited in the accounts for the year in which it is determined.
