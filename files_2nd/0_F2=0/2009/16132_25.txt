0 The adjustment to deferred consideration related to the reduction in the estimate of the amount payable in respect of acquisitions made in prior periods.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units.
The carrying value of goodwill analysed by business segment is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Regionals 72.3 74.8 Nationals 2.2 2.2 74.5 77.
0 The Regionals division comprises eight cash-generating units.
The Nationals division comprises a single cash-generating unit.
The Group tests the carrying value of goodwill at the cash-generating unit level for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
At the period end reporting date, a review was undertaken on a value in use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections in respect of periods to 2058 for goodwill relating to print businesses and to 2016 for goodwill relating to online businesses.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required.
The post-tax discount rate used at the period end reporting date was 7.0% 2008: 7.0% reflecting a long-term equity and debt mix based on the period end enterprise value assuming a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times.
The equivalent pre-tax discount rate is 8.0% 2008: 9.0%.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budget for 2010 and projections thereafter.
The cash flow forecasts reflect past experience of and the risk associated with each asset.
Cash flows beyond 2016 are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Capital expenditure cash flows have been forecast to reflect the cycle of capital investment required, including printing press replacement.
Management believes it is appropriate to forecast for a period of greater than five years for print businesses to most appropriately reflect the length of the capital investment cycle and for online businesses to reflect the recovery from the current cyclical downturn.
We have assumed our current forecast performance for 2010 and then revenue growth rates in the 2011 to 2016 projections in the range between 0% and 15% which vary with managements view of the cash-generating units market position and maturity of the relevant market.
The perpetuity growth rates used vary between 0% and 2.5%.
The impairment review is sensitive to a change in key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and the perpetuity growth rates.
With the exception of the online specialist national recruitment cash-generating unit, based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a modest change in a single factor will not result in a material impairment in any of the Groups cash-generating units.
With the exception of the online specialist national recruitment cash-generating unit, a reasonably possible change of 1% in the discount rate or 1% in the perpetuity growth rates would not change the conclusions of the impairment review.
The impact on the online specialist national recruitment cash generating unit of these reasonably possible changes could be an impairment of up to 10 million.

The directors consider publishing rights and titles have indefinite economic lives due to the historic longevity of the brands and the ability to evolve the brands in the ever changing media landscape.
It is not practicable to review individual publishing rights and titles due to the interdependencies of the inflows within the cash-generating units.
The impairment review of the carrying value of the Groups publishing rights and titles performed at the period end reporting date indicated that no impairment was required 2008: an impairment charge was required in respect of the cash-generating units of the Midlands and the South both of which are included in the Regionals business segment.
The impairment review was based on comparing carrying value with value in use.
The impairment charge in 2008 reduced the carrying value of the publishing rights and titles of the cash-generating unit relating to the Midlands by 161.0 million and to the South by 29.0 million before tax.
Net of tax, the impairment reduced the carrying value of the publishing rights and titles by 136.8 million.
The impairments arose due to declining profits in the respective cash-generating units as a result of advertising revenue falls.
The customer relationships and domain names included above have estimated useful lives of between five and 10 years and are tested at the cash-generating unit level for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently if there are indications that customer relationships and domain names might be impaired.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 37 days 2008: 41 days.
No interest is charged on the receivables.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 120 days because historical experience is such that these receivables are generally not recoverable.
Trade receivables less than 60 days and between 60 days and 120 days are provided for based on specific circumstances and by reference to past default experience.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group, where appropriate, uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Limits attributed to customers are reviewed during the period where appropriate.

Accordingly, there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
There are no significant amounts included in the allowance for doubtful debts relating to impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation.

The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking views of the financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes for qualifying employees, the Southnews Money Purchase Scheme which is closed to new members and the TMPP.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The current service cost charged to the consolidated income statement of 1.1 million 2008: 1.2 million represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the scheme rules.
Contributions that were due have been paid over to the schemes at both reporting dates.
Following closure of the defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2010, all active members of the defined benefit pension schemes will have the option to join the TMPP and the membership of this scheme could increase by around 3,000 from the current membership of around 900.
Trinity Mirror plc Annual Report & Accounts 200993 36 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through an optimal balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings note 27, cash and cash equivalents note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising share capital and reserves note 30.
Gearing ratio The Board reviews the capital structure, including the level of gearing and interest cover, as required.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio is 2.5 2008: 2.2 at the reporting date.
The Groups interest cover for the period was 4.7 2008: 4.0.
The gearing ratio and interest cover at the reporting date were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Net debt note 29 299.8 348.7 EBITDA 121.0 161.2 Net debt to EBITDA 2.5 2.2 Operating profit note 39 105.4 145.2 Total interest expense note 10 22.4 36.4 Interest cover 4.7 4.0 Net debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings and includes derivative financial instruments less cash and cash equivalents.
EBITDA is stated after non-recurring items with the exception of the impairments of intangible assets and fixed assets.
Operating profit is before non-recurring items and amortisation.
During 2009 and 2010 the financial covenants attached to this facility are a minimum interest cover of 2.5 times and a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.75 times.
During 2009, cash drawings of 10.0 million made on the facility were repaid.
In addition, during 2009 all of the Group finance leases were repaid in full.
As a result of repayment of the Newcastle press finance lease the related guarantee drawn down on the bank facility was released leaving the bank facility undrawn at the reporting date.
Externally imposed capital requirement The Group is subject to externally imposed capital requirements based on net worth covenants under the US private placement loan notes and the 178.5 million bank facility.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument, are disclosed in note 3.
Categories of financial instruments The Groups significant financial assets are cash and trade and other receivables which are classified as loans and receivables and are accordingly held at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables, bank overdrafts and loan notes are all designated as other financial liabilities and held at amortised cost.
The Groups derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through the consolidated income statement.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through regular meetings with the Group Finance Director analysing exposures by degree and magnitude of risk.
These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments where appropriate to hedge these exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Groups Treasury function provides a monthly report to the Board covering compliance with covenants and other Treasury related matters.
Financials Governance Business review Who we are Trinity Mirror plc 94 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Financial instruments continued Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has entered into specific derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk primarily in respect of its US private placement loan notes as set out in note 28.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts where appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Euro 1.6 5.1 US$ 331.9 362.3 0.1 41.7 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the Euro and US$.
The Euro exposure arises on sales of newspapers in Europe.
The Euro sales represent less than 2% 2008: 2% of Group revenue.
The Euros are kept on deposit and used to fund Euro costs.
When Euros on deposit build to a target balance they are converted into sterling.
The Group does not hedge the Euro income or deposits because the risk of foreign exchange movements is not deemed to be significant.
The US$ exposure arises on the US private placement loan notes which are mainly US$ denominated and fixed interest.
At the time of the US private placement loan notes issue the Group entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to change the US$ principal and US$ fixed interest profile of the debt to sterling principal and sterling floating interest.
The timing of the swaps exactly match every private placement principal and interest payment due.
As a result the Group is not subject to any US$ foreign exchange exposure on its US private placement loan notes and matching swaps.
The Groups consolidated balance sheet shows the US private placement loan notes converted to sterling at the reporting date currency rate.
The matching swaps are carried at fair value which represents the value of the fixed to floating swap, the currency element of the principal payments due and the currency element of the interest payments due.
The difference between the valuation approaches gives rise to a charge or credit to the consolidated income statement.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the sterling rate against the Euro and US$ in the current and prior period.
A 10% movement in exchange rates based on the level of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities represents the assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items including external loans.

During the current and prior period no contracts were entered into.
Trinity Mirror plc Annual Report & Accounts 200995 36 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on the financial assets and liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the reporting date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared using the Groups monthly cash forecasting model.
A 2% increase in interest rates has been used and represents the assessment of a reasonably possible change.
If interest rates had been 2% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the period would decrease increase by 7.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below.
In calculating fair value, consideration has been given to the turmoil in the financial markets.
Other price risks The Group has no listed equity investments and is not directly exposed to equity price risk.
The Group does not actively trade these investments.
The Group has indirect exposure through its defined benefit pension schemes.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group only transacts with financial institutions that are rated the equivalent to investment grade and above.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are reviewed by the Board at appropriate times and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse sectors.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of trade receivables.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
Concentration of credit risk with a single counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Standard and Poor.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The table below shows the internal credit limit and amount on deposit with the Groups major counterparties at the reporting date using the Standard and Poor credit rating symbols: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Credit limit Deposit Credit limit Deposit Location Rating m m m m HSBC Bank plc London AA 50.0 0.1 50.0 0.2 Santander UK London AA 20.0 15.0 Lloyds TSB Bank plc London A 50.0 34.1 50.0 10.2 Barclays Bank plc London A 50.0 1.1 50.0 0.6 Royal Bank of Scotland plc London A 20.0 10.9 20.0 9.6 During 2009, as a result of the repayment of the Newcastle press finance lease the bank guarantee drawn down against the Groups bank facility was released.
Financials Governance Business review Who we are Trinity Mirror plc 96 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk results from having insufficient financial resources to meet day-to-day fluctuations in working capital and cash flow.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non derivative and derivative financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group could be required to pay.
The table includes both principal and interest cash flows.
Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.
