Indefinite life brands comprise a portfolio of Consumer Healthcare products primarily acquired with the acquisitions of Sterling Winthrop, Inc. in 1994, Block Drug Company, Inc. in 2001 and CNS, Inc. in 2006, together with a number of pharmaceutical brands from the acquisition of Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. in 2009.
The book values of the major brands are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Panadol 399 411 Sensodyne 271 289 Stiefel trade name 209 Breathe Right 193 216 Physiogel 176 Polident 115 123 Corega 102 109 Biotene 108 99 Poligrip 71 75 Solpadeine 59 60 Others 753 412 2,456 1,794 Each of these brands is considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support.
The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk profiles, and their size, diversification and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology, generally using four year post-tax cash flow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country-specific risks.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between 2% and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these brands.
