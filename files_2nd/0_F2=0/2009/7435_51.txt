Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
There is also a small defined benefit pension arrangement in Ireland, which is included in the Group amounts disclosed below, but is not included in the Company amounts.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
A valuation is undertaken on at least a triennial basis by a qualified actuary.
The most recently completed actuarial valuation was as at 30 June 2007 and was based on an assumed investment return of 5.0% to 6.75% a year, salary increases of 3.0% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.5% to 3.0%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 94%, representing a funding deficit of 5.1m, which is being funded by three special contributions of 2.17m on 31 October 2008, 1 May 2009 and 1 May 2010.
The valuation reflected a number of changes to the Scheme effective from 1 November 2008, as follows: future increases to pensionable salaries are capped at the lower of RPI and 5% pa: pension increases in respect of service from 1 November 2008 are capped at the lower of RPI and 2.5% pa: regular funding rates increased to 21.2% of pensionable pay from 19.9% previously.
The increased regular funding is being met through higher member contributions, with the previous rate of 5.0% of pensionable pay increasing from 1 November 2008 to 6.5% for non-executive members and 10.0% for executive members, with the Groups contribution rate moving from 14.9% of pensionable pay to 14.7% for non-executive members and 22.5% for executive members: the Company has agreed to settle directly the administrative costs of the Scheme.

Pension arrangements continued The curtailment of the Scheme due to the cap on pensionable salary, resulted in a 5.6m past service cost credit which has been recognised in the income statement as an exceptional item see Note 7.
The next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2010.
The Pension Benefit Section was generally closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002, with the exception of 543 members who transferred into the Scheme on 31 May 2003 from the EMI Group Pension Fund as a result of the Groups flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Benefit Section for the year ended 25 April 2009 were 2.5m 2008: 2.6m excluding the special contribution noted above of 2.17m.
The total employer contributions to the defined benefit plans for the financial year commencing on 26 April 2009 are expected to be 2.5m.
Pension Saver Section The Pension Saver Section is of the defined contribution type and is open to all permanent and temporary staff of the Group aged between 18 and 64 years.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Group matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Groups contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benefits of their choice.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Saver Section for the year ended 25 April 2009 were 1.1m 2008: 0.9m.
In addition, employer contributions to similar pension arrangements in HMVs international businesses totalled 0.6m 2008: 0.5m Defined benefit pensions Amounts reflected in the financial statements in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit funding method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the respective balance sheet dates.
The major assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: As at As at 25 April 2009 26 April 2008 % per annum % per annum Rate of price inflation 3.6 3.5 Rate of salary increase 3.6 5.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.4 3.3 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 6.5 6.2 Expected rate of return on equities 8.2 8.1 Expected rate of return on bonds 6.2 6.2 Expected rate of return on index-linked bonds 4.6 4.6 The expected rate of return on Scheme assets are based on external historical and forecast market information.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used as at both 25 April 2009 and 26 April 2008 are in line with the actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2007.
They reflect the pensioner mortality 00 series tables rated up one year and based on year of use with allowance for medium cohort improvements applying from 2000 subject to a minimum of 1% per annum.
These bases imply the following life expectancies: 2009 2009 2008 2008 At age 65 for At age 65 for At age 65 for At age 65 for someone someone someone someone currently currently currently currently Life expectancy years aged 65 aged 50 aged 65 aged 50 Male 21.4 22.9 21.3 23.1 Female 23.8 25.3 23.6 25.5 Other non-financial assumptions are also consistent with those used in the actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 June 2007.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the Scheme deficit of 17.4m, recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity in the Group, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Scheme.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 25 April 2004.
