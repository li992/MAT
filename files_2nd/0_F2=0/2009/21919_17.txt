British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Notes to the Accounts 1.
"Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ""IFRS""."
"These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ""IASB"", together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee ""IASC"" that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union."
The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The financial statements are also presented in pounds sterling.
a Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
"Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice ""the SORP"" for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies ""the AIC"" in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP."
b Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but were not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IAS 1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2009 Comprehensive revision including requiring a statement of comprehensive income IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised March 2007 1 January 2009 IAS 27 Consolidated Financial Statements revised 1 July 2009 IFRS 2 Share based payment: Vesting conditions 1 January 2009 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Improving disclosures about Financial Statements 1 January 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 no Company Income Statement has been prepared.
d Presentation of Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Company's status as a UK investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Company's compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where an ex-dividend date is not available, dividends received on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount.
Interest receivable from cash and shortterm deposits is accrued to the end of the year.
f Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses have been charged to revenue except as follows: The base management fee which has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to capital within the Income Statement.
The performance element of the management fee is charged 100% to capital within the Income Statement: Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are recognised within the Income Statement as a capital item: Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
38 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 g Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
"In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the ""marginal basis""."
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
h Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
In accordance with IFRS recognition and measurement principles, all the Group's investments are classified as investments designated at fair value through profit or loss and are described in these financial statements as investments held at fair value.
All investments are designated as held at fair value upon initial recognition and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
These may include recent arm's length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost subject to any provision for impairment.
"Investments held by the subsidiary undertaking are classified as ""held for trading"" and are valued at fair value in accordance with the policies above for listed and unlisted holdings."
"Profits or losses on investments ""held for trading"" are taken to revenue."
Foreign exchange gains and losses for fair value through profit or loss on investments are included within the changes in their fair value.
i Movements in fair value Changes in fair value of investments not designated as held for trading are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Income Statement as capital items.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and short-term deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
k Dividends payable Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
39 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Notes to the acounts continued l Foreign currency translation Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary items that are fair valued and are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement.
m Equities Index Unsecured Loan Stock 2013 In accordance with IFRS recognition and measurement principles, the Equities Index Unsecured Loan Stock 2013 is classified as a financial liability designated at fair value through profit or loss and is valued at the closing offer price.
Changes in its fair value are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
On cancellation, realised gains and losses are also recognised through the Income Statement as capital items.
Interest paid on the Index Stock is charged to the Income Statement as a revenue item.
n Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and are recognised through the Income Statement as revenue items.
This does not comply with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, which would require the finance costs of the Debenture Stocks and the Index Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in the same proportions as the Management Fee.
However, the Directors consider that the treatment adopted, which is consistent with previous years, is the most appropriate given the liquidity of the Company and the nature of the Index Stock.
o Debenture pricing 1 3 The 8 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 and 10 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2011 are valued at amortised cost under the effective interest method and secured by a floating charge over all assets of the Company.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance of the 1 8 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 have been capitalised and are amortised over the term of the finance.
Further details of the Debenture Stocks are disclosed in notes 13 and 19. p Capital Reserve Capital reserve other The following are taken to this reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments: Exchange difference of a capital nature: Expenses, together with the related taxation effect, allocated to this reserve in accordance with the above policies: and Capital reserve investment holding gains The following are taken to this reserve: Increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end.

Financial instruments and capital disclosures Risk management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Group is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Group's financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
The Group makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
The Group may also enter into derivative transactions which comprise forward foreign exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Group's investing activities and quoted options on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Group has used derivatives during the current financial year as part of its investment strategy.
The Board sets out its investment policies on page 22.
The Board and the Company's Investment Manager consider and review the number of risks inherent in managing the Group's assets which are detailed below.

It is not the Group's usual policy to hedge this risk.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling upon receipt.
During the year, the Company entered into three forward foreign exchange contracts.
Two transactions consisted of buying sterling and selling Japanese yen, the other contract consisted of buying sterling and selling euros.
These contracts were closed in June 2009 and July 2009.
As at 30 September 2009, the net realised gains on these three contracts amounted to 7,897,000.
There were no open forward foreign exchange contracts as at 30 September 2009.
Over the year sterling weakened against the Group's principal investing currencies, the US Dollar by 10.27% 2008: 12.51%, the Euro by 13.77% 2008: 11.42% and the Japanese Yen by 24.33% 2008: 19.24%.
A 5% rise or decline of sterling against foreign currency denominated i. e. non sterling assets held at the year end would have decreased increased the net asset value by 26,185,000 or 3.56% of net asset value 2008: 21,204,000 or 3.35% of net asset value.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments in fixed-interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the interest payable on variable rate borrowings: and the fair value of the Company's long-term debt in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
These debenture stocks are carried in the Company's balance sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the Company's share price and discount premium which is not likely to be material.
Further information on the debenture stocks is shown in note 13.
The interest liability of the Index Stock moves in accordance with movements in the income returns of the FTSE All-Share Index.
This exposure may be reduced by investing in non-current assets expected to perform in line with the FTSE All-Share Index.

51 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Notes to the acounts continued Capital management policies and procedures The Company's capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value: through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Group's capital on an ongoing basis.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, which takes account of the Group's position and the Investment Manager's views on the market: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
The Group is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
Contingencies, guarantees and financial commitments In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT, and in early November HM Revenue & Customs decided not to contest that ruling.
The Board is taking steps to reclaim such back VAT on investment management fees as it can and has recovered 3,027,102 up to the date of this report.
For the current period to 30 September 2009 960,163 has been recovered and shown within these financial statements.
This has been allocated 837,466 as revenue and 122,697 as capital within the Income Statement in line with VAT previously written-off on investment management and performance fees previously charged.
Interest amounting to 686,803 relating to these recoveries has also been received by the Company.
While most of the Back VAT has now been recovered, the Company will continue to pursue recovery of outstanding Back VAT, and interest, as far as is practical.
The Directors consider it inappropriate to recognise any Back VAT not yet recovered, in these financial statements.
At 30 September 2009 the Group had a financial commitment in respect of a sub rights issue on Deutsche Wohnen of 12,361,000.
At 30 September 2009 the Group had no contingent liability in respect of any investments carrying an obligation for future subscription or underwriting commitments 2008: nil.
Related party disclosure The related party transaction with Asset Value Investors Limited is set out in the Directors Report on page 24.
Management fees for the year amounted to 3,804,000 2008: 4,890,000 and the performance fee for the year was 2,313,000 2008: nil.
As at the year end, the following amounts were outstanding in respect of management fees: 317,000 2008: 408,000 and performance fees: 2,313,000 2008: nil.
At 30 September 2009 the Group had a contingent liability pursuant to an Indemnity given to Caledonia Investments Limited Caledonia in respect of sums received from Caledonia by way of repayment of VAT the VAT Refund paid by the Company between 1991 and 1995 on investment management fees to Caledonia, against any amounts of VAT including any interest or penalties for which Caledonia is liable to repay to HM Revenue & Customs in respect of the VAT Refund together with all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by Caledonia in enforcing its rights under the Indemnity.
The Companys liability under the Indemnity shall not exceed the amount of the VAT Refund received from Caledonia which amounted to 619,178 including simple interest of 263,337.
