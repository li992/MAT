At 31 December 2009 the Group had cash reserves of 135.5m and total undrawn committed bank facilities of 178.8m available.
Most of the facilities are clean and the unencumbered assets represent 87.8% of our fixed assets and investment properties.

Average interest rate of borrowings reduced from 3.72% to 2.49% and average remaining tenure of borrowings decreased from 30 months to 27 months.
Non-current assets Property, plant, equipment and lease premium prepayment Property, plant, equipment and lease premium prepayment decreased by 94.0m.
The main contributor to the decrease was a 65.6m effect of exchange movements.
The Group also invested 15.6m to improve its hotel portfolio which included an additional 7.7m on construction of Studio M, a new 365-room hotel in Singapore that will open during 2010.
The balance of 7.9m reflecting the Groups tight controls on capital expenditure.
The Group states land and building at depreciated deemed cost, being their UK GAAP carrying value, including revaluations as at 1 January 2004 together with additions thereafter less subsequent depreciation or provision for impairment.
Since 2005, external professional open market valuations on certain of the Groups hotel portfolio have taken place at each year end covering the entire Groups hotel portfolio over a three year period.
An external valuation was carried out on those properties that were principally last valued in 2006.
Based on external valuations conducted at 31 December 2009 on 41.6% based on net book value of the Groups hotel portfolio, a valuation surplus of 171.0m is estimated but this has not been recorded in the accounts.
Investment properties Investment properties increased by 4.0m due to a 10.3m transfer made from property, plant and equipment to investment properties for the residential component of the Sunnyvale site, net of 0.2m negative fair value adjustment and 6.1m adverse exchange movements.
Sunnyvale residences were transferred from property, plant and equipment under the scope of IAS16 at 1 January 2009 to investment properties IAS 40.
