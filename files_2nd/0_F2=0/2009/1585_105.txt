Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.
Acquisition of Interwoven, Inc. continued Had the results of Interwoven for the period from 1 January 2009 to 17 March 2009 been included in the groups results for the year ended 31 December 2009 then group net profit adjusted would have theoretically been decreased by $18 million.
It is not practicable to determine the effect of the Interwoven acquisition for the period from acquisition to the end of the financial period.
The groups core products and those of the acquired entity have been integrated and the operations merged such that it is not practicable to determine the portion of the result that specifically relates to Interwoven on a stand-alone basis.
During the year the group used a third party specialist valuation team to determine the purchased intangibles allocation to the interwoven, Inc acquisition of $311.3 million.
These assets are set out in note 13.
