f Derivative fi financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured in future periods at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
A number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profi t or loss.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
In cases where these derivative instruments are signifi cant, hedge accounting is applied as described above.
Where hedge accounting is not applied, movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Net borrowing Net borrowing comprises cash and cash equivalents together with bank overdrafts and loans, fi finance leases and other loans.

Following the completion of a consultation process on the closure to future accrual of four defi ned benefi t schemes in December 2008, a curtailment gain of 35.5 million net of expenses of 2.8 million was recognised in 2008.
There is no deferred tax relating to curtailment gains in 2009 2008: 9.9 million.
Rationalisation costs of 9.9 million relate to non-recurring redundancy and other associated costs incurred in the rationalisation of the Groups structure at the end of 2009, including ensuring that the size of the Groups UK construction capability refl ects the expected decline in our general construction markets, while maintaining the capability to support the delivery of Public Private Partnership projects and meet the needs of the support services business.
The Offi ce of Fair Trading OFT penalty of 5.4 million was imposed on Carillion JM Limited CJM formerly Mowlem following the conclusion of the OFTs investigation of cover pricing in the construction industry under the Competition Act 1998.
The penalty relates to CJMs construction business and relates entirely to the period prior to CJMs acquisition by Carillion.
No other member of the Group was subject to the investigation.
Alfred McAlpine and Vanbots Group integration and reorganisation costs in 2008 primarily relate to redundancy and property exit costs arising from a review of the Groups requirements following the acquisition of these businesses in 2008.
An income tax credit of 2.8 million 2008: 16.5 million relating to the above has been included within taxation in the income statement.

Firstly, current year profi ts earned in low tax jurisdictions no longer require the provision of a taxable temporary adjustment, the impact of which is included within Effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions.
Secondly, it has allowed the release of the liability that was associated with the taxable temporary differences that arose on the historical unremitted earnings from investments overseas.
The amount over provided in prior years of 0.2 million includes Nil 2008: 8.3 million attributable to the agreement of certain issues with the tax authorities and the release of a taxable timing difference associated with an investment in an overseas subsidiary.

This has resulted in an increase of 9.4 million in the goodwill arising on acquisition refl ecting the recognition of defi cit funding obligations in relation to defi ned benefi t pension arrangements.
Goodwill of 633.5 million and customer contracts and lists of 127.8 million arose in 2008 on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and the Vanbots Group as disclosed in note 30.
The goodwill recognised on these acquisitions represents the present value of future income streams expected to be generated from margin growth in the businesses acquired together with identifi able cost savings within the enlarged Group.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have signifi cant amounts of goodwill: 1 2009 2008 m m Construction services excluding the Middle East segment Building 163.0 163.0 Infrastructure 70.0 70.0 Canada 10.5 10.0 243.5 243.0 Support services segment Business services 805.7 805.7 Infrastructure services 52.1 52.1 857.8 857.8 Total goodwill 1,101.3 1,100.8 1 Restated on adoption of IFRIC 14 see note 33 Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units.
In the absence of any identifi ed impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services, Construction services excluding the Middle East, and Head offi ce as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units CGUs, within the Construction services and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
Our CGUs have been identifi ed within our reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash infl ows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value in use in 2009 was determined on a similar basis to 2008.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2008 and revisited in 2009 in the light of the challenging economic environment which resulted in more conservative estimates about the future.
The impact of the global economic downturn on the fi financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their fi financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that refl ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has fi five CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent so one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the discount rate management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
In calculating the cost of equity a range of market risk premiums were used with a Beta value of 0.74 2008: 0.9.
A market premium of 9.0 per cent 2008: 9.0 per cent was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 12.4 per cent 2008: 13 per cent for the CGUs in the Construction services excluding the Middle East segment.
A market premium of 5.8 per cent 2008: 5.1 per cent was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 9.5 per cent 2008: 9.0 per cent for the CGUs in the Support services segment.
The annual growth rates are based on internal assessments with no growth anticipated for the Construction services segment and Infrastructure services CGU and growth expected in the Business services CGU at 5.0 per cent for the next 5 years, 2.5 per cent growth for years six to ten which refl ects expected changes to the Retail Price Index and no growth thereafter.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 79 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued The Group prepares cash fl ow forecasts derived from the most recent fi financial budgets approved by management for the following year and extrapolates cash fl ows based upon the growth rates indicated above.
These growth rates do not exceed the long term industry average and refl ect the synergies from recent acquisitions.
The impairment tests at 31 December 2009 show that for all CGUs the number of years required to recover the carrying value is below 11 years.
Management consider that these pay back periods are not excessive given the long term strategic benefi t of all the acquisitions and in particular the acquisition of Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows an increase of 1.0 per cent does not increase the number years to recover the carrying amount over 12 years for any of the CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis on the Business services growth rate shows that with no growth the number of years required to recover the carrying value increases to 15 years.
As at 31 December 2009, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 33.0 million 2008: 44.2 million is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 will be 79 per cent complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 125.4 million arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in 2008 will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2019.

In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups fi financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on fi financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal fi financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profi t centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Carillion plc 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Section 05 Financial statements 27.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East, Canada and the Caribbean.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profi ts arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are signifi cant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2009 2008 m m United States of America Dollar 15.6 17.6 Canadian Dollar 91.6 82.2 United Arab Emirates Dirham 7.6 8.5 Other 0.5 1.5 115.3 109.8 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 115.3 million 2008: 109.8 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net assets amounts to 61.6 million 2008: 62.6 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 1.0 million 2008: loss of 8.9 million on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowing that arose from the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 and Alfred McAlpine in 2008, ongoing working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to fl oating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in respect of US dollar denominated borrowing interest rates would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.3 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowing an increase of 0.7 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowing an increase of 3.1 million and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowing an increase of 0.4 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that suffi cient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry signifi cant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan and short term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2009 was 274.4 million 2008: 329.8 million for the period post the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine.

Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each fi financial asset.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2009 2008 Net Net trade trade receivables Impairment receivables Impairment m m m m Not past due 182.7 244.3 Past due less than 3 months 75.8 0.8 118.1 1.1 Past due between 3 and 6 months 18.3 4.6 39.6 12.5 Past due between 6 and 12 months 12.9 1.5 28.0 2.1 Past due more than 12 months 10.4 2.7 8.9 1.1 300.1 9.6 438.9 16.8 The movement in the impairment provision is as follows: 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 16.8 13.4 Provision acquired 1.2 Provision created 2.9 3.4 Provision utilised 7.6 0.4 Provision released 2.5 0.8 At 31 December 9.6 16.8 In the current global economic climate, whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased, on balance the Group believes that debtors will meet their payment obligation in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2009.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a signifi cant amount of credit risk.

In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range spanning up until September 2035.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2009 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 31.6 million 2008: 43.7 million of which 23.9 million 2008: 26.1 million and the related deferred tax asset of 6.7 million 2008: 7.3 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-current asset other investments and derivative fi financial instruments.
The fair value of non-current asset other investments is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash fl ows using asset specifi c discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available for sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of derivative fi financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
The movement in fair value of non-current asset other investments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: m At 1 January 2009 Transfer from investments in jointly controlled entities 43.8 Fair value adjustments At 31 December 2009 43.8 The fair value of non-current investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 5.3 million.

Acquisitions in 2008 On 12 February 2008, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Alfred McAlpine for total consideration of 554.5 million.
The total consideration was satisfi ed by the issue of 112.9 million Carillion plc shares valued at the quoted mid-market price at the close of business on the day preceding the effective date of acquisition of 337.75 pence and 171.7 million in cash and 1.3 million of loan notes.

Acquisitions and disposals continued Alfred McAlpine, its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities operate in a number of sectors and industries, particularly facilities management, infrastructure services, civil engineering and construction.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Acquirees net assets at the acquisition date Initial Carrying Accounting Acquired carrying amount Carrying Fair value policy intangible Recognised 1 a b amounts adjustments amounts adjustments adjustments assets values m m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 26.4 26.4 0.7 25.7 Intangible assets 229.8 45.3 184.5 184.5 125.4 125.4 Investments in jointly controlled entities 13.4 13.4 0.9 14.3 Deferred tax assets 27.9 33.1 61.0 0.9 61.9 Inventories 11.2 11.2 11.2 Trade and other receivables 304.0 101.2 202.8 15.5 187.3 Assets held for sale 16.7 16.7 2.3 19.0 Cash and cash equivalents 46.8 46.8 46.8 Borrowing 143.2 143.2 143.2 Trade and other payables 292.2 292.2 0.3 291.9 Income tax 1.4 1.4 1.4 Retirement benefi t liabilities 42.8 29.0 71.8 3.2 75.0 Deferred tax liabilities 2.9 2.9 2.9 35.1 35.1 Provisions 4.5 4.5 4.5 Net identifi able assets and liabilities 189.2 142.4 46.8 181.1 15.5 90.3 59.5 Goodwill recognised on acquisition 624.4 Total consideration including attributable costs 564.9 1 Upon the adoption of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 14 on 1 January 2009, the carrying amounts in relation to retirement benefi t liabilities and deferred tax assets have been restated.
This has resulted in an increase in the carrying amount adjustments to retirement benefi t liabilities and deferred tax assets of 13.1 million and 3.7 million respectively, refl ecting the recognition of defi cit funding obligations in relation to defi ned benefi t pension arrangements, together with the associated deferred tax asset.
The overall impact of IFRIC 14 has been to increase goodwill recognised on acquisition by 9.4 million.
There are two types of adjustments which have been refl ected in the above: a those which have been made to Alfred McAlpines initial carrying amounts for events up to the acquisition date and b those which have been made to the acquired assets and liabilities of Alfred McAlpine.
The allocation of these adjustments between these two categories involves a degree of judgement and both categories should therefore be considered when reviewing the Alfred McAlpine balance sheet.
The determination of the carrying amount adjustments by Alfred McAlpine included in a followed a dialogue between Alfred McAlpines and Carillions management teams during the course of the due diligence period granted to Carillion by Alfred McAlpine.
Both types of adjustments are discussed further below.
a Carrying amount adjustments The 46.8 million carrying amount of net assets acquired at 12 February 2008 restated for the impact of IFRIC 14 as set out above incorporates a number of adjustments made to Alfred McAlpines initial carrying amounts.
These adjustments followed a rigorous review of all balance sheet categories, including over 400 contracts, and include the following items, which are stated net of deferred tax where appropriate: A reduction in the capitalised value of IT assets of 45.3 million which followed an impairment review of all IT capitalised intangible assets.
A 101.2 million reduction in the carrying amount of contracts which comprised a 53.8 million reduction in the carrying amount of completed contracts, with a view to facilitating a swift resolution of all outstanding matters, including cash settlements pertaining to these contracts and a 47.4 million reduction in the carrying amount of ongoing contracts.
A deferred tax asset of 25.0 million was recognised in relation to these reductions in carrying amounts.
The increase in retirement benefi t liabilities of 29.0 million restated for the impact of IFRIC 14 as set out above refl ected changes in general market assumptions in respect of the rate of increase in salaries, the rate of increase in pensions, the infl ation rate and the discount rate.
In addition to this an associated deferred tax asset of 8.1 million was also recognised.

Acquisitions and disposals continued b Fair value adjustments The principal fair value adjustment relates to 184.5 million of goodwill on the Alfred McAlpine balance sheet at the date of acquisition which is reclassifi ed at the same value as goodwill on Carillions balance sheet under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The 15.5 million accounting policy adjustment results from applying Carillions policy in respect of expensing rather than capitalising certain mobilisation costs associated with the commencement of new contracts.
The 90.3 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts.

The accounting policy adjustment of 1.3 million relates to the alignment of profi t recognition policies on construction contracts.
The 1.6 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition of 9.1 million represents the present value of future income streams expected to be generated from margin growth in the Vanbots Group together with identifi able cost savings within the enlarged Group.

IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualifi ed actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 4.40% 3.00% 3.80% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions 3.40% 2.00% 2.80% 2.04% Infl ation rate 3.40% 2.00% 2.80% 2.04% Discount rate 5.80% 6.25% 6.30% 7.50% Where schemes have adopted the 2.5% per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment the assumption is 2.4% per annum 2.2% p. a. in 2008 rather than the higher amount shown above.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to signifi cant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation.
All the schemes, except the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary.
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specifi c assumptions based on industry experience.
The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme, the Mowlem 1993 Scheme and the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan adopted the PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 years table for non-retired members mortality and the PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 years for retired members mortality at the last valuation.
The previous bases were PA92 Base 3 years and PA92 Base 1 year respectively.
The life expectancies for a male aged 65 are shown below.
2009 2008 PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 yrs PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 yrs Non-retired members 21.3 years 21.3 years PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 yrs PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 yrs Retired members 19.7 years 19.7 years Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 107 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 31.
Retirement benefi t obligations continued The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefi ts under the local GAAP, CICA 3461.
The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental infl ation rates in relation to the Post Retirement Benefi t Plan.
The immediate trend rate is eight per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of fi five per cent per annum 2013.
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by 0.8 million and the total service cost by 0.1 million.
A decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by 0.6 million and total service cost by 0.1 million.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the Actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Comprehensive Income as permitted under IAS 19.
Following the adoption of IFRIC 14 The limit on a defi ned benefi t asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction on 1 January 2009, comparative information for 2008 has been restated accordingly.

The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group statement of comprehensive income is 236.5 million 2008 restated: 16.5 million.
The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme defi cit recognised on transition to IFRS of 85.2 million and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a signifi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fi financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to fi final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of fi final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specifi c risks within each contract that have been identifi ed during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated fi final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Carillion plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Section 05 Financial statements 32.
Accounting estimates and judgements continued Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to fi final out-turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash fl ows and profi tability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash fl ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defi ned benefi t pension scheme valuations In determining the valuation of defi ned benefi t pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: expected return on plan assets infl ation rate mortality discount rate salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.
New accounting standards and interpretations Upon the adoption of IFRIC 14 on 1 January 2009, the Group has restated prior year information, which has had the following impact on net assets: At At 31 December 1 January 2008 2008 m m Net assets as previously reported 872.6 502.9 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 14 on goodwill 9.4 retirement benefi ts 20.0 21.6 deferred tax 5.6 6.0 5.0 15.6 Net assets as restated 867.6 487.3 The impact on goodwill of 9.4 million relates to the effect of IFRIC 14 on retirement benefi t liabilities net of deferred tax at the date of acquisition of Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 refl ecting the recognition of minimum funding arrangements.
In addition to the above, IFRIC 14 reduced actuarial losses and taxation in the 2008 consolidated statement of comprehensive income by 14.7 million and 4.1 million respectively.
In 2009, IFRIC 14 reduced actuarial losses and taxation in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by 13.3 million and 3.7 million respectively, leading to an increase in net assets of 9.6 million.
The adoption of IFRIC 14 has no impact on reported profi t or cash fl ow.
None of the other new accounting standards adopted on 1 January 2009 as referred to in note 1 has any impact upon reported profi t, net assets or cash fl ows.
