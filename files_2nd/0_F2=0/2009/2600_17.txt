Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs.
A description of the Groups principal activities is set out in the Directors report on page 1.
There is no significant difference in the nature of activities across different geographies.
The identification of CGUs reflects the way in which the business is managed on a geographical basis.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years being the maximum period over which detailed future cash flows for each CGU are prepared.
For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate to derive a terminal value.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, achievability of future margins, any significant changes to the customer base and the discount rate used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates, together with managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
The growth rate has been calculated based principally on current inflation rates of the relevant economies.
At 31 December 2009 two CGUs, Groupe Pierre Le Goff GPLG and North America, carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of GPLG at 31 December 2009 was 124.0m 2008: 136.1m.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America at 31 December 2009 was 176.6m 2008: 179.1m.
At 31 December 2009 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Groups CGUs, excluding GPLG and North America, was 448.8m 2008: 470.7m.
The weighted average growth rate used in 2009 was 2.5% 2008: 2.0%.
A discount rate of 8% 2008: 9% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
These key assumptions have been used for the two largest CGUs GPLG and North America.
Similar assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have considered alternative market risk assumptions to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual countries with discount rates ranging from 8%-12%.
