PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 124 124 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards IASs and interpretations, collectively IFRS, published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Groups full year financial statements.
The consolidated and company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies Accounts Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 as amended.
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009 will be filed with Companies House Gibraltar following the Companys Annual General Meeting.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found overleaf: PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Governance 125 Financial statements Other information 1.
Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition note 2 Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 10 Impairment of assets held for sale note 13 Payment processor receivables note 15 Provisions note 15 Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities note 22 Share-based payments note 26 Basis of accounting The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
The functional and presentational currency used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is US dollars.
The functional currency is the currency in which the parent company operates and it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Group.
A number of Group companies operate in local currencies but the amounts involved are not material.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by PartyGaming Plc.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Except as noted below, the financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting, and are consolidated from the date of acquisition i. e. the date on which control of the subsidiary effectively commences to the date of disposal i. e. the date on which control over the subsidiary effectively ceases.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited formerly Headwall Ventures Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The Directors note that transactions under common control are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and that there is no guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS.
This guidance is included at paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS does not include guidance for a particular issue, the Directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards.
In this regard, it is noted that the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued an accounting standard covering business combinations FAS 141 that is similar in a number of respects to IFRS 3.
In contrast to IFRS 3, FAS 141 does include, as an Appendix, limited accounting guidance for transactions under common control which, as with IFRS 3, are outside the scope of that accounting standard.
The guidance contained in FAS 141 indicates that a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests accounting, which was previously set out in Accounting Practices Board APB Opinion 16, may be used when accounting for transactions under common control.
Having considered the requirements of IAS 8, and the guidance included within FAS 141, it is considered appropriate to use a form of accounting which is similar to pooling of interests when dealing with the transaction in which the Company acquired its controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 126 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currency Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into US dollars at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place.
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity the currency reserve.
Exchange differences recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of group entities' separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Group's net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the currency reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising poker including backgammon, casino, bingo, sports betting and network services third-party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services, as well as fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions, is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is net of certain promotional bonuses and the value of PartyPoints accrued.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees.
Poker including backgammon net revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament.
Casino, bingo and sports betting net revenue represents net house win, adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on open betting positions.
Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from network services, and fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions.
Revenue in respect of network service arrangements where the third-party owns the relationship with the customer is the net commission invoiced.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists primarily of broadcasting costs.
Broadcasting costs are expensed over the applicable life-cycle of each programme based upon the ratio of the current years revenue to the estimated remaining total revenues.
Segment information An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses.
Each segments operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the operating segments within the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance.
The Group reviews financial statements presented by product type which are supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Governance 127 Financial statements Other information 1.
Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land and buildings which are stated at cost and are not depreciated due to immateriality.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold land and buildings, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements - over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment - 33% per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles - 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Externally acquired intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separate from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
Identifiable assets are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 128 1.
Accounting policies continued Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, evenly over the periods the Group expects to benefit from their use, and varies between: Brand and domain names - 10% to 20% per annum Broadcast libraries - 50% per annum Capitalised development expenditure - 20% to 33% per annum Contractual relationships - over the length of the contract Customer lists and contracts - 20% to 50% per annum Intellectual property and gaming licences - over the length of the licence Non-contractual relationships - 33% per annum Software - 20% to 33% per annum Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment At the end of each reporting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Governance 129 Financial statements Other information 1.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by parties related to Principal Shareholders, the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Treasury shares The consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve own shares.
Any excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to the share premium account.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the balance sheet when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, no provision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 130 1.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency cashflows and to hedge foreign exchange risk on nonUS dollar denominated financial assets and liabilities.
The derivative instruments used by the Group consist mainly of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value calculated using either discounted cashflow techniques or by reference to market prices supplied by banks.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position.
The Group presently does not adopt any form of hedge accounting as described in IAS 39 and does not anticipate any requirement to do so in the foreseeable future.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans and receivables.
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months.
Amounts held as security deposits are considered to be restricted cash.
There are no financial assets that are classified as held to maturity or available for sale.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They arise principally through the amounts due from payment processors that remit funds on behalf of customers and other types of contractual monetary asset and cash and cash equivalents.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, which are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
A category for out of the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Groups operations can be segmented into the following reporting segments: poker including backgammon, casino, bingo, sports betting and unallocated corporate including World Poker Tour.
These segments are the basis upon which the Group reports its segment information.
Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocated to individual segments.
The measure of reporting segment performance is Clean EBITDA and the basis for arriving at this is the same as the Group accounts.

Under the terms of the Nil-Cost Plan each option takes the form of a right, exercisable at nil-cost, to acquire shares in the Company, the vesting of which are satisfied by existing shares which had been issued to the Employee Trust.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA, the Company implemented on 29 December 2006 a one-off adjustment to existing incentive awards and also granted new incentive awards by using an additional 40 million shares gifted to the Employee Trust by certain founders of the Company.
As such, the exercise of these options will have no cash impact on the Company.
However, IFRS requires that the fair value of the options be amortised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the life of the options.
Details of the share option plans are shown in note 26 and within the Remuneration report.

At the year end there were Group companies registered in 13 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial statements.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In Gibraltar, the Group benefits from the exempt company regime.
The Gibraltar exempt company regime will be phased out on 31 December 2010.
Assessable income will taxed in Gibraltar at the rate of 10% thereafter.
In India, the Group benefits from a tax holiday on income from qualifying activities, which has been extended until March 2011: under current rules assessable income is taxed in India at approximately 34%.
The Minimum Alternative Tax has increased from 11.33% to approximately 17% from 1 April 2009.
Fringe benefit tax, which is payable at approximately 34% on a proportion of specified benefits provided or deemed to have been provided to past and present employees in India, has been abolished with effect from 1 April 2009.
In 2009, the Group acquired businesses in the UK and the US.
As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions.
Future tax charges will be reduced by a deferred tax credit in respect of amortisation of certain acquired intangibles see note 20.

Clean EBITDA and Clean earnings per share are performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the impact of one-off and non-cash items.
They are therefore calculated before the provision for items associated with the Groups Non-Prosecution Agreement, reorganisation costs and before non-cash charges relating to share-based payments.

The value of acquired intangibles is based on cashflow projections at the time of acquisition.
Customer lists from existing customers take into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names.
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
Licences are amortised over the life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
In the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008, intangible assets were classified as goodwill, development expenditure, and other intangibles.
The carrying amount of development expenditure at 31 December 2008 was $6.4 million and other intangibles was $45.5 million.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the following cash generating units CGUs : 2009 2008 As at 31 December $million $million PartyPoker 8.6 8.6 Gamebookers 86.4 86.4 EOL IOG 37.6 37.6 Cashcade 95.1 At end of year 227.7 Impairment In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets.
A detailed review was undertaken at 31 December 2009 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived from those assets.
In respect of the PartyPoker, EOL IOG, WPT and Cashcade CGUs, the Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.

Financial instruments and risk management In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 144 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: short-term investments: trade and other receivables: cash and cash equivalents: loans and borrowings: trade and other payables: client liabilities and progressive prize pools: and foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course of business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2009 or at the prior year end.
The Group operates a sports betting business and always has open bets.
As at 31 December 2009 and at the prior year end the fair market value of open bets was not material.
Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the period ended 31 December 2009 or in the prior year.
Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported to management on a weekly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function.
The last internal control review was undertaken during 2007 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a weekly basis.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of $150 million that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration of refinancing risk.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
During 2009 the Group borrowed 35 million as a means of managing liquidity risk.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Governance 145 Financial statements Other information 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Capital risk In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, the Groups policy is that gross debt should not exceed $300 million and that the leverage ratio of gross debt clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
An analysis of gross debt is as follows: 2009 2008 As at 31 December $million $million Gross debt USD m 56.5 Clean EBITDA USD m 134.2 133.3 Ratio 0.4 Headroom USD m 144.8 200.0 Details of the Groups dividend policy is disclosed in the Chairmans Statement and also on page 49 of this Annual Report under the heading Review of 2009. Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their balance sheet, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis by the Director of Payment Processing.
An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five is assessed as weak.
During the year a reassessment was made as to the criteria for each rating, with criteria for a rating of 1 or 2 becoming more stringent.
The table for 2008 showing the exposure to PSPs by rating has been restated on the basis of these new criteria.
2009 2008 As at 31 December $million $million 1 Very Strong 0.3 0.1 2 Strong 9.1 9.8 3 Good 16.2 15.9 PSPs amounts due 25.6 25.8 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or at least better quality, PSPs.
The table below sets out the movement in the impairment of amounts due from PSPs.

Cash investments: Wherever possible and commercially practicable the Group invests cash through major financial institutions where the counterparty has a one year credit default swap CDS as quoted by Bloomberg, of no more than 2% or, in the case of pooled money market funds, a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moodys rating agency.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with banks that do not meet this credit rating in Israel, Bulgaria and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements.
These balances are kept to a minimum.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the statement of financial position.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk The Groups current net cash position is maintained primarily on a floating basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.
Currency risk Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some or all of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cashflows are hedged.
The Group also economically hedges material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a weekly basis.
A $5 million currency tolerance limit between US dollars and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than US dollars in order to hedge non-US dollar investments up to 50% of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of ongoing debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
At 31 December 2009 the Group had a loan of 35 million and 31 December 2008 the Group had no material non-US dollar debt which hedged net investments.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and any resultant impact on the Groups earnings of either: an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate interest-bearing financial instruments, or a 10% strengthening or weakening in the US dollar against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing.
The Group also holds interest bearing bank debt.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the US dollar, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-US currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.

Financial instruments and risk management continued The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as a projection of likely future events and losses.

Share options continued Terms and conditions Nil-Cost Plan Options granted under this plan during the period generally vest in instalments over a four to five year period.
These awards are not generally subject to performance conditions as this is regarded as detracting from their attraction and retention capabilities and instead usually vest on a phased basis over a four to five year period.
The main exception to this general policy are the awards made to key employees in the bingo segment, which will only vest subject to the satisfaction of a stretching EBITDA target for that business unit for 2012.
FMV Plan Options granted under this plan during the period generally vest in instalments over a three year period.
There are no performance conditions attached to options issued by the Group under the terms of the FMV Plan.
Executive Directors are not eligible to receive any awards under this plan.
PSP Plan These options vest subject to the achievement of a total shareholder return TSR performance target over the three year period commencing on 1 January or 1 July of 2007, 2008 and 2009 compared to the median TSR of a sector comparator group.
The threshold for vesting at which 25% will vest, will be TSR equalling the median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if the Companys TSR exceeds the median by 10% per annum calculated over the three year period.
It is estimated that outperformance of the median by 10% per annum is broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance over three years.
Executive FMV Plan These options vest subject to the growth in the Companys Clean Earnings per share equalling or exceeding 15% per annum in the three year period from 1 January of 2007, 2008 and 2009.
