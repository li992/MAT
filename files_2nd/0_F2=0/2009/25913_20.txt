Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th September 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Gains and losses on sales of investments, exchange differences of a capital nature, and other capital receipts and payments, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are accounted for in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in the capital column.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of any withholding tax.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to the revenue column of the income statement on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Stock lending income and interest receivable on deposits is taken to the revenue column of the income statement on an accruals basis d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: management fees are allocated 20% to the revenue column and 80% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of an investment are charged to the capital column.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 37. e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25: Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in gains or losses from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
h Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to capital.
i Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends payable are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non-taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 4 on page 34. k Repurchases of the Companys own shares for cancellation The costs of repurchasing the Companys own shares for cancellation, including the related stamp duty and transaction costs are charged to Capital Reserves and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of share capital repurchases and cancelled is transferred out of called up Share Capital and into Capital Redemption Reserve.

This asset has arisen because cumulative deductible expenses have exceeded taxable income over the life of the Company.
This asset may be utilised in future years where there is an excess of taxable income over deductible expenses.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the accounts as it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

However, the actual amount paid was 4,840,000 due to share repurchases after the balance sheet date but prior to the share register record date.
The final dividend proposed in respect of the year ended 30th September 2009 is subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the accounting policy of the Company, this dividend will be reflected in the accounts for the year ended 30th September 2010. b Dividend for the purposes of Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 S842 The proposed dividend of 4,756,000 2008: 4,872,000 is the amount on which the requirements of S842 are considered.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
40 JPMorgan Japanese Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares of Japanese companies which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and a floating rate loan facility with Lloyds TSB.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports, is sterling.
However the Companys assets, liabilities and income are almost entirely denominated in Yen.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the Yen sterling exchange rate.
Yen denominated borrowing may be used to limit the exposure of the Companys portfolio to the Yen sterling exchange rate.
Income is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have exposure to the Yen at 30th September are shown below.
The Companys investments which are not monetary items have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2009 2008 Yen Yen 000 000 Current assets 31,650 44,175 Creditors 54,502 67,932 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 22,852 23,757 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 339,669 321,882 Total net foreign currency exposure 316,817 298,125 The above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to foreign currency risk during the year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 20.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% 2008: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the Yen, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 226 267 Capital return 2,285 2,643 Total return after taxation for the year 2,059 2,376 Net assets 2,059 2,376 Conversely if sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 226 267 Capital return 2,285 2,643 Total return after taxation for the year 2,059 2,376 Net assets 2,059 2,376 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is broadly representative of the whole year.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company may finance part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.
42 JPMorgan Japanese Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2009 2008 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 23,577 35,333 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year borrowings on the loan facility 52,375 52,844 Total exposure 28,798 17,511 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
The Company has a Yen 10.0 billion loan facility with Lloyds TSB which expires in August 2010.
Under the terms of this agreement the Company may draw down up to Yen 10.0 billion at an interest rate of Yen LIBOR as offered in the market for the loan period plus a margin of 0.275% plus the Mandatory Costs Rate, which is the lenders cost of complying with certain regulatory requirements.
At 30th September 2009 the Company had drawn down Yen 7.5 billion 52.4 million on this facility at an interest rate of 0.7%, repayable on 26th October 2009.
At 30th September 2008, the Company had drawn down the whole Yen 10.0 billion 52.8 million on this facility at an interest rate of 1.4%, repayable on 22nd October 2008.
The exposure to floating interest rates has fluctuated during the year between net cash and loan balances as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Maximum debit interest rate exposure to floating rates net loan balances 44,623 62,135 Maximum credit interest rate exposure to floating rates net cash balances 11,614 3,927 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the revenue after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2008: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
2009 2008 1% increase 1% decrease 1% increase 1% decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 131 131 248 248 Capital return 419 419 423 423 Total return after taxation for the year 288 288 175 175 Net assets 288 288 175 175 JPMorgan Japanese Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 20.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the whole year as the level of exposure to floating interest rates has fluctuated during the year due to changing amounts drawn down on the loan facility.
The highest amount drawn down on the loan facility during the year amounted to Yen 7.5 billion 52.4 million and the interest rate on these drawings fluctuated between 0.7% and 1.5%.
iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30th September comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 339,669 321,882 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 12 and 13.
This shows that all of the investments value is in Japan.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not necessarily be wholly exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of revenue after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2008: 10% in the fair value of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.
2009 2008 10% increase in 10% decrease in 10% increase in 10% decrease in fair value fair value fair value fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 44 44 42 42 Capital return 33,790 33,790 32,021 32,021 Total return after taxation for the year and net assets 33,746 33,746 31,979 31,979 44 JPMorgan Japanese Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in settling financial liabilities as they fall due.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
