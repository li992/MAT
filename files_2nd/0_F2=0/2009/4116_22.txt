The Company went on to the Stock Market in 1985 and since that time has evolved into a business that is highly focused on the food sector.
Activities include the supply of fresh pork, gourmet sausages, charcuterie, cooked meats, sandwiches and traditional dry cured bacon.
This now represents 100 percent of sales as the pet and aquatics business was sold subsequent to the year end and has been treated as discontinued.
