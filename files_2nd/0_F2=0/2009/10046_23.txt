Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a number of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved objectives, policies and authorities.
Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in managing the associated risks.
Market Risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The principal exposures arise with respect to the US dollar against the Pound sterling.
To mitigate risks associated with future commercial transactions the Group policy is to hedge known, and certain forecast transaction exposures based on historical experience and projections.
The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated exposure and can hedge up to five years ahead.
The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant currencies to hedge its investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Details of the hedges in place can be found in note 31.
Interest rate risk The Group has borrowings issued at both xed and oating rates of interest.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk whereas oating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to maintain at least 25% of its net debt at xed rates.
The Group mitigates interest rate risks through swaps which have the economic effect of converting xed rate borrowings into oating rate borrowings and oating rate borrowings into xed rate borrowings.
Details of the hedges in place can be found in note 31. Credit risk The Group is not subject to signi cant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of companies across the world.
In addition, many of the Groups principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals.
Policies are maintained to ensure the Group makes sales to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial instruments which it controls through only dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains suf cient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash ow forecasts.
Additional headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash ows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions.
Key ratios are monitored to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Groups principal credit agreements.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date.

Financial risk management continued Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal exposures in relation to market risks are to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and Pound sterling and to changes in US interest rates.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the balance sheet date.
The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the hedge designations in place on the relative dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness.

However, as all US dollar debt is designated as a net investment hedge, the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of overseas operations.
Capital risk management The Groups objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital while maintaining adequate capital to protect against volatility in earnings and net asset values.
The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Obligations under finance leases current see note 28 0.8 1.0 Bank and other borrowings current see note 29 9.7 13.5 Obligations under finance leases non-current see note 28 4.6 6.2 Bank and other borrowings non-current see note 29 856.4 1,094.5 Less cash and cash equivalents see note 25 62.9 67.3 Total net debt 808.6 1,047.9 Total equity 1,273.6 1,286.4 Debt equity % 63% 81% 4.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In applying the Groups accounting policies set out in note 2 management is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
The estimates and judgements that have the most signi cant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Goodwill Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units CGUs.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of the future cash ows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 19.
Development costs and programme participation costs The Group capitalises development costs and programme participation costs provided they meet certain criteria.
Costs are only capitalised where management are satis ed as to the ultimate commercial viability of the project based on available information.
Projects typically involve long-term relationships on aircraft platforms and in assessing commercial viability, estimates need to be made of future revenues, margins and cash ows which are dependent on a number of factors including the size, utilisation and life of the aircraft eet to which the capitalised costs relate.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination On the acquisition of a business it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired provided they meet the criteria to be recognised.
The fair values of these intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins and cash ows.
Income taxes In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Environmental matters The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which we have been identi ed as a potentially responsible party under US law.
Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and estimation of the costs that the Group may incur in respect of such claims and an appropriate provision is made.
To the extent these estimates change as more information becomes available adjustments are made to the carrying value of the provision.
The Group has extensive insurance arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group.
Legal and regulatory The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required for these matters is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
However, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates.
Retirement bene t obligations The liability recognised in respect of retirement bene t obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, in ation, salary increases, healthcare cost increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
Any change in these assumptions would impact the retirement bene t obligations recognised.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 34.

The Group announced as part of its 2008 annual results that, in response to the economic downturn, it would take appropriate action to reduce costs.
The actions involve reductions in factory direct and indirect headcount and related costs arising from volume reductions, transforming the way the business is managed, effectively removing a layer of management, freezing executive pay and reducing pension and other bene ts.
The programme is progressing well and is on track to deliver the expected savings of 50 million annually by the end of 2010 at a one off cost of 25 million.
Costs incurred during the year include rationalisation costs and the transfer of certain production processes into our Mexico facility.
Further exceptional operating costs of 2.7 million are expected to arise over the next year as the integration is completed.
c. During the prior year the consolidation of our two US training systems facilities at a new site in Atlanta was completed.
d. During the year other business integration costs were also incurred, principally the completion of the integration of the Avery Hardoll business, commenced in 2008, into other businesses in the Group.
e. In January 2009 the Group sold a small product line from its Aerospace Equipment segment and recorded a pro t of 0.1 million.

Pro t of parent company The pro t attributable to the shareholders of Meggitt PLC includes a pro t, after dividends received, of 132.0 million 2008: 104.6 million which has been dealt with in the accounts of that Company.
Meggitt PLC, which prepares its accounts in accordance with UK GAAP, has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate pro t and loss account.
Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share EPS is calculated by dividing the pro t attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes any shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 38.
The calculation of diluted EPS adjusts the weighted average number of shares to re ect the assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert.
For the Group this means assuming all share options and equity-settled share appreciation rights in issue are exercised.

Goodwill Total m Year ended 31 December 2008 Opening cost 1,067.8 Exchange rate adjustments 309.3 Businesses acquired 5.6 Closing cost 1,382.7 Year ended 31 December 2009 Opening cost 1,382.7 Exchange rate adjustments 120.8 Closing cost 1,261.9 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is any indication of impairment.
No impairment charge was required in the year 2008: Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is Nil 2008: Nil.
For the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs which principally comprise its individual business operations.
The allocation of goodwill to CGUs is initially carried out in the year a business is acquired according to those CGUs which are expected to bene t from the acquisition.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs or disposed of outside the Group.
An analysis of goodwill by principal CGU is shown below: 2009 2008 m m Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems MABS 679.6 749.6 Whittaker Controls Inc 166.5 183.3 Engineering Fabrics Corporation EFC 70.3 79.0 Meggitt Training Systems Inc 64.6 72.5 Other 280.9 298.3 Total 1,261.9 1,382.7 For each acquired CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount from value in use calculations.
The value in use calculations are based on cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and plans for the next five years approved by management in December 2009.
Cash ows for periods beyond five years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The resultant cash ows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are shown below: Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by managements detailed plans.
Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates including forecasts for OEM deliveries of large jets, regional aircraft and business jets: air traf c growth and military spending by the US DoD and other major governments.
Sales prices and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group has examined the effects of other past shock events on air traf c growth both in the short term and the medium long term.
These included the effects of the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, the first Gulf War in 1991 and impact of 9 11, SARS and the second Gulf War in 2001.
Past experience has shown that these events only had a short term negative impact on air traf c growth.
Overall a cautious approach to volume levels, selling prices and cost increases has been taken given the current global economic uncertainty.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each CGU with a signi cant level of goodwill are described below.
MABS and Whittaker Controls Inc are broadly spread across both civil aerospace and military platforms with Whittaker Controls Inc also operating in the energy sector.
Within the civil aerospace sector MABS is a world leader in the supply of braking systems for regional aircraft and business jets, whilst the Whittaker Controls business, which designs and manufactures uid control devices and systems, has a higher content on large jets.
Both businesses have signi cant OEM and aftermarket revenues derived from sole source positions with the aftermarket, where platform lives can be up to thirty years for civil aircraft and longer for military, representing the greater proportion of revenues.
In civil aerospace external forecasts suggest air traf c demand, measured in revenue passenger kilometres RPKs, will grow by 3% to 5% in 2010.
However, recovery will be more modest in capacity terms, measured in available seat kilometres ASKs.
On large jets and regional aircraft this is expected to translate into increased use of existing aircraft although deliveries of new aircraft are expected to decline in 2010 and 2011 before recovering in 2012.
Usage of business jets is expected to increase from 2010 with deliveries of new aircraft increasing from 2011.
In military markets, the US DoD base budget is predicted to grow by around 4% in 2010 and by 3% thereafter until 2015.
The Groups energy businesses are also forecast to remain robust over the coming years.
EFC and Meggitt Training Systems Inc both operate in the military sectors.
The principal customer of EFC is the US DoD to whom EFC are a leading supplier of exible fuel tanks.
Meggitt Training Systems Inc supplies integrated live and virtual training packages for armed forces and law enforcement agencies across the world.

Goodwill continued Growth rates used for periods beyond those covered by managements detailed budgets and plans.
Growth rates are derived based on managements estimates which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the extent to which a CGU has sole source position on platforms where it is able to share in a continuing stream of highly pro table aftermarket revenues, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological content of the CGUs products.
For the purpose of impairment testing a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates UK: 2.2% 2008: 2.4%, US: 2.6% 2008: 2.9%, the latter has been used: Discount rates applied to future cash ows.
The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be applied.
The Group WACC was then adjusted to re ect risks speci c to the CGU that are not already re ected in the future cash ows for that CGU.
The principal CGU for which least headroom between the calculated recoverable value in use and the carrying value of goodwill exists is Meggitt Training Systems Inc where headroom is 9.7 million.
The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis to determine the extent to which its assumptions would need to change for the calculated recoverable amounts from value in use to equal the carrying value of goodwill of the CGU and the results of the analysis are shown below: Estimates of cash ows during the five year period for which management estimates have been used would need to reduce by 9% or Estimates of long term growth rates would need to reduce by 47% or The discount rate applied to future cash ows would need to increase to 12.4% 20.

For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash ows at prevailing market rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable pro ts are available.
No provision has been made for taxation that would arise in the event of foreign subsidiaries distributing their reserves as these amounts are retained for investment in the businesses.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

In determining pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted to re ect the characteristics of the scheme populations.
The Groups mortality assumptions in the UK were updated during the year and are based on recent mortality investigations of Self Administered Pension Schemes adjusted to re ect the pro le of the membership of the Plan.
Allowance has also been made for rates of mortality to continue to fall in the medium term and that in the long term, rates of mortality will continue to fall at the rate of 1% per annum.
In the US mortality assumptions are based on the RP2000 IRS RPA tables.

The nature of each scheme which has a signi cant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement is set out below.
1996 No 1 & No 2 Executive Share Option Schemes and Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 Equity-settled Share options are granted to certain senior executives at an option price equal to the market price of the shares on the date the grant is made.

Options can only be exercised if the Group meets an earnings per share performance condition.
The Group has no obligation, legal or constructive, to settle the options in cash.
During 2009 all options granted under Part B of the schemes were converted to equity settled share appreciation rights SARs whereby the executive on exercise is entitled to receive equity equivalent to the gain in value between the option price and the market price on the date of exercise.
Awards under Part A of the schemes remain as options whereby the executive on exercise is entitled, on payment of the option price, to the number of shares under option.
An expense of 1.0 million 2008: 2.1 million was recorded in the year.

Share-based payment continued Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives.
For awards made in 2007 and earlier years the number of shares if any, that an executive will ultimately receive, will depend on the Groups performance during a three year period commencing at the beginning of the financial year in which the award is made.
Performance is measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Group with that of other companies in a comparator group chosen by the Remuneration Committee.
Changes to the performance condition were made for the 2008 award.
In line with what is now common market practice, 50% of the awards vesting are based on TSR performance and 50% on an earnings per share condition EPS.
The three year performance period for awards made in 2009 which are subject to the TSR performance condition was also amended to commence on the date of award.
An expense of 1.7 million 2008: 2.4 million was recorded in the year.
