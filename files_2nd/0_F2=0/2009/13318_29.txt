Warning about unsolicited investment contacts boiler room scams Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
If these calls persist, hang up.
A 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
The FSA receives and deals with an average of 6,500 consumer enquiries a year on such scams.
