The revaluation reserve is shown net of deferred tax.
AFS is the term used for Available-for-sale investments and is shown net of deferred tax.
Revaluation movements on development properties, now under IAS 40, are taken through the income statement.

A transfer to effect this reclassification has been made during the period accordingly.
