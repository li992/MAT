This demonstrates the attractiveness of the opportunities into which the capital raised was deployed.
Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions 47.9m, purchased syndicate capacity 6.0m, US admitted licences 5.8m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects 10.8m.
The increase in intangibles in the period is primarily due to the acquisition of First State which gave rise to 13.2m of goodwill, 1.1m on syndicate capacity and 6.9m on IT projects net of amortisation.
The expenditure on IT projects primarily relates to new underwriting and claims systems in the US.
Acquisition of First State Management Group First State was acquired from the Hartford Financial Services Group for total consideration of $34.0m.
The transaction was structured in such a way that the total consideration paid was in respect of net assets acquired of $1.4m, pipeline profit in respect of in force policies assumed on completion of the transaction of $5.1m and $27.5m of goodwill.
Prior to completion of the transaction it was agreed with third party capital providers on syndicate 623 that they would contribute $7.5m towards the cost of the transaction as syndicate 623 is a beneficiary of the business written by First State.
This has been reflected as a reduction to the goodwill balance giving net goodwill of $20.0m and the contribution will be collected from third party names in instalments over the five underwriting years 2009 to 2013.
Note 34 to the accounts sets out further information on the acquisition.
Beazley Annual Report 2009 39 Financial review | balance sheet management continued Reinsurance debtor credit quality AAA 4% AA 4% AA 53% AA- 33% A 4% A 2% Insurance receivables Insurance receivables are amounts receivable from brokers in respect of premiums written.
The balance at 31 December 2009 was 309.3m, a growth of 7% over 2008.
We continue to outsource the collection of our Lloyds premium broker balances to JMD Specialist Insurance Services Limited, which operates within the Lloyds market as specialist credit controllers.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of 556.7m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of 161.4m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of 158.6m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of 398.1m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: Minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria eg.
minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs. medium tail.
The chart above shows the profile of these assets based on S&P rating at the end of 2009: Timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and Regular monitoring of outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committees.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2009 we had provided 9.8m 2008: 9.0m in respect of reinsurance recoveries.
Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the accounts.
The largest items included comprise: Deferred acquisition costs of 96.6m: Deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of 5.5m: and Profit commissions receivable from syndicate 623 of 5.1m Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of 2,499.2m consist of two main elements being the unearned premium reserve UPR and gross insurance claims liabilities.
Our unearned premiums reserve has increased by 19% to 544.5m, resulting from the increase in premiums written during the year.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims have increased by 9% to 1,954.7m, primarily as a result of the increase in business written.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements Borrowings The group utilises two long-term debt facilities: In 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured fixed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25% and the current carrying value of this debt is 161.9m: and A US$18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034.
At the time of the 150m bond issue we entered into a derivative transaction, whereby we matched our investment and currency risk by swapping the sterling fixed rate loan into the equivalent of: 108m of floating rate sterling loans: and US$80m of floating rate US dollar loans.
These items have been accounted for using hedge accounting for both the floating rate and currency elements of the transaction.
In addition to these borrowings Beazley has a 100m syndicated short-term banking facility, managed through Lloyds Banking Group Plc.
The facility is currently unutilised.
Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Primarily capital is required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators FSA, Lloyds, Irish Financial Services Regulator, and the US state level supervisors.
Further capital constraints come from rating agencies on a group wide basis and for Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. BICI and the Lloyds syndicates on a standalone basis.
In both cases we aim to manage our capital to obtain a financial A rating from the rating agencies.
Beazley also holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements and targets a level of surplus capital that would enable it to take advantage of new underwriting opportunities such as the acquisition of insurance companies or managing general agents MGAs whose strategic goals are aligned with our own.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital base to target capital levels.
Our preferred use of capital is to re-deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However there may be times in the cycle when the company will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
If such a point were reached the board would consider returning capital to shareholders.
With effect from 1 January 2010 Beazley has taken the decision to match the groups underwriting capital by currency to the principal underlying currencies of its written premiums.
This will ensure that the groups capacity to underwrite business would be unaffected by any future movements in exchange rates.
To achieve this, the group has increased the US dollar component of its capital base by US$487m since the start of 2010 with an equivalent decrease in the sterling component.
Beazley Annual Report 2009 41 Financial review | balance sheet management continued Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity of 618.6m alongside 150m of tier 2 subordinated debt and $18m subordinated long-term debt and an undrawn banking facility of 100m mentioned above.
In April 2009, the group raised 151.7m through a 9 for 19 rights issue and placing.
This resulted in 183.1m shares being issued at an issue price of 86p.
The following table sets out the groups sources and uses of capital: 2009 2008 m m Sources of funds Shareholders funds 618.6 412.7 Tier 2 subordinated debt 150.0 150.0 Long-term subordinated debt US$18m 11.2 12.5 779.8 575.2 Uses of funds Lloyds underwriting 492.2 360.8 Capital for US insurance company 68.9 77.1 561.1 437.9 Surplus 218.7 137.3 Unavailable surplus 46.1 18.0 Fixed and intangible assets 78.2 60.6 Available surplus 94.4 58.7 Individual capital assessment The group is required to produce an individual capital assessment ICA which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
In order to determine the ICA, we made significant investment in both models and process: We use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and The ICA process is embedded so that the teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
The ICA has increased from 360.8m to 492.2m reflecting the increase in business Beazley is writing at Lloyds.
Included within this are premiums resulting from the acquisition of First State and Momentum Underwriting Management, increased premium written for our existing line of business, particularly short tail catastrophe exposed lines and the effect of a strengthening of the US dollar since the ICA was previously calculated.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements Solvency II Solvency II is an EU-wide proposal on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers due to come into effect from October 2012.
The central elements of Solvency II are: Pillar 1: Demonstrating adequate financial resources quantification: Pillar 2: Demonstrating an adequate system of governance risk assessment: and Pillar 3: Public disclosure and regulatory reporting requirements.
The board has set two guiding principles for Solvency II, namely: to develop a framework that can be used to inform management and assist with business decision making: and to hold an appropriate and efficient level of capital for the agreed risk appetite through risk identification and mitigation.
At Beazley, the strong risk management framework already embedded throughout the business means that Solvency II is an evolution rather than a new direction.
A working group has been established to lead the implementation of Solvency II at Beazley and the gap analysis and implementation plan have been submitted to the regulators for review.
Oversight and governance will be provided on behalf of the board by a management group comprising the group finance director, risk director and an underwriting team leader.
A regular reporting schedule to the board has been established as Beazley recognises the importance of the implementation of Solvency II.
However, it must be recognised that there is still uncertainty, not least because the full details of Solvency II implementation are yet to be confirmed.
Whilst we plan to undertake a significant amount of work on Solvency II related activities during 2010, Beazley is well placed at this stage to ensure a successful implementation.
