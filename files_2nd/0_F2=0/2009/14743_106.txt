The return on equities is 3.5% per annum in excess of the yield on government bonds.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation at 31 March 2009.
The actual return on plan assets is as follows: Consolidated Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Actual return on plan assets 276.9 12.0 125.3 35.5 History of experience gains and losses Consolidated Company 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 m m m m m m m m m m Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense before adjustment for taxation 359.0 185.0 47.4 14.1 18.3 188.4 146.3 17.6 29.0 6.2 Experience losses on scheme liabilities 222.2 122.2 40.0 123.3 38.0 The cumulative actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense before adjustment for taxation since the adoption of IAS 19 is 318.5m losses 2008 81.2m gains.
