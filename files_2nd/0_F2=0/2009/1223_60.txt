1c Financial risk management The Group operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which has been characterised by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility for monitoring financial risk management to a sub-committee of the board.
The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the Groups finance department.
The Group has a treasury policy that sets out specific guidelines to manage currency risk, interest rate risk, securities price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and also sets out circumstances where it would be appropriate to use financial instruments to manage these.
Currency risk The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while a significant proportion of its costs are settled in sterling.
The Group seeks to use currency exchange contracts and currency options to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
The Group is also exposed to currency risk in respect of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of its overseas subsidiaries.
At present, the Group does not mitigate this risk, for example by using foreign currency intra-group loans, as it has currently no requirement for external borrowings.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $45 million 2008: $100 million for sterling.
In addition, the Group utilises option instruments which have various provisions that, depending on the spot rate at maturity, give either the Group or the counterparty the option to exercise.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had outstanding currency options under which the Group may, under certain circumstances, be required to sell up to $106 million 2008: $144 million for sterling.
A common scenario with options of this type is that the spot price at expiry is such that neither the Group nor the counterparty chooses to exercise the option.
The Group had $87 million 2008: $86 million of accounts receivable denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balances of $26 million 2008: $61 million.
Thus the Groups currency exchange contracts and currency options at the year-end potentially exceeded its US dollar current assets.
This is because the Group has taken longer term positions through its currency exchange contracts given the predictable nature of the Groups cash flows.
The Group has elected not to apply hedge accounting, and all movements in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments are recorded in the income statement, offsetting the foreign exchange movements on the accounts receivable, cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities balances being hedged.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out euro currency exchange contracts.
As at 31 December 2009, if sterling had strengthened by 10% against foreign currencies with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity excluding non-monetary assets and liabilities would have been 2.7 million lower 2008: sterling weakened by 10%, post tax-profit and equity lower by 4.2 million, mainly as a result of the mix of financial instruments at respective year-ends.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2009, the Group had 149 million 2008: 79 million of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2009, 75% 2008: 38% of interest-bearing assets comprising cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and the Groups convertible loan notes, are at fixed rates and are therefore exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID or base rate equivalents and is therefore exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The proportion of funds held in fixed rather than floating rate deposits is determined in accordance with the policy outlined under Liquidity risk below.
Other financial assets, such as available-for-sale investments, are not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
Had interest rates been 1% lower throughout the year, interest receivable would have reduced by approximately 0.9 million 2008: 0.6 million and profit after tax by 0.6 million 2008: 0.4 million.
The Group had no borrowings during 2008 or 2009.
71 Notes to the financial statements continued 1c Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk continued The Group has no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations in place at the year-end since it has no loan financing, and as such no hedge accounting is applied.
The Groups cash flow is carefully monitored on a daily basis.
Excess cash, considering expected future cash flows, is placed on either short-term or medium-term deposit to maximise the interest income thereon.
Daily surpluses are swept into higher-interest earning accounts overnight.
Securities price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk on available-for-sale investments.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for securities which are generally unlisted at the time of investment or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The board of directors reviews holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group.
Funds for such ventures are limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline of the value of investments will not be substantial in the context of the Groups financial results.
i Listed investments At 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Group had no listed investments.
ii Unlisted investments The Group has unlisted investments including convertible loan notes with a carrying value as at 31 December 2009 of 9.4 million 2008: 1.2 million.
A permanent 10% fall in the underlying value of these companies as at 31 December 2009 would therefore have reduced the Groups post-tax profit by 0.7 million 2008: 0.1 million and resulted in a nil 2008: nil reduction in other components of equity.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the board of directors.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the board of directors and such approval is limited to financial institutions with at least an AA rating, or in the case of UK building societies had over 1 billion in assets, except in certain jurisdictions where the cash holding concerned is immaterial.
At 31 December 2008 and 2009, the majority of the Groups cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods up to one year.
Over 90% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were held with global financial institutions with at least an AA rating, or in the case of UK building societies had over 1 billion in assets, as at 31 December 2009 and 2008.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The Group generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of its customers are large, well-established companies.
The Group has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Group markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
At 31 December 2009, one 2008: one customer accounted for just over 10% of accounts receivable.
All monies owed from this customer in respect of the amounts due at 31 December 2009 have been paid after the year-end.
This customer was one of many large, established semiconductor companies that accounted in total for over 80% of the year-end accounts receivable balance, where the risk of default on monies owed is deemed negligible.
The Group performs credit checks on all customers other than those paying in advance in order to assess their creditworthiness and ability to pay its invoices as they become due.
As such, the balance of accounts receivable not owed by the large semiconductor companies is still deemed by management to be of low risk of default due to the nature of the checks performed on them, and accordingly a relatively small allowance against these receivables is in place to cover this low risk of default.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
72 1c Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities, such that highly liquid resources exceed the Groups projected cash outflows at all times.
Surplus funds are placed on fixedor floating-rate deposits depending on the prevailing economic climate at the time with reference to forward interest rates and also on the required maturity of the deposit as driven by the expected timing of the Groups cash receipts and payments over the shortto medium-term.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow.
This is carried out at both a local and a Group level, with the local subsidiaries being funded by Group as required.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and capital and reserves attributable to equity holders of the Company, as disclosed in note 19 and the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, sell assets to raise cash or take on debt.
Between 2004 and 2007, the Group's strategy was to increase its balance sheet efficiency by reducing its cash balance via returning cash to shareholders through a progressive dividend policy and a rolling share buyback programme.
Whilst the Group intends to further increase balance sheet efficiency over time, in 2008 and 2009, recognising the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the net cash balance was increased from 51.3 million at the start of 2008 to 78.8 million at 31 December 2008 and to 141.8 million at 31 December 2009.
In the year, the dividend was increased by 10% reflecting the board's long-term confidence in the business.
No share buybacks were made in the year, though the programme remains in place and will be used as and when the board believe it is appropriate to do so.
The capital structure is continually monitored by the Group.
73 Notes to the financial statements continued 1c Financial risk management continued Capital risk management continued During 2008, the Group entered into a 50 million revolving credit facility providing the Group access to funds for any corporate purpose.
The Group did not drawdown on this facility at any time during 2008 or 2009 and it was not renewed in 2009.
Fair value of currency exchange contracts The fair value of currency exchange contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The estimation of the fair value of the asset in respect of currency exchange contracts is 457,000 at 31 December 2009 2008: liability of 18,457,000.
The liability in 2008 was due to the mix of contracts, settlement rates and currency volatility but predominantly due to the significant strengthening of the US dollar during the second half of 2008, resulting in the year-end USD GBP spot rate being lower than the majority of settlement rates.
All of these contracts matured during the year, and with the strengthening of sterling during 2009, the majority of these accrued losses did not crystallise at settlement.
The resulting gains and losses on the movement of the fair value of currency exchange contracts is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative expenses, as shown below: 2008 2009 000 000 Gain loss in income statement 18,914 17,961 Valuation hierarchy The table below shows the financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method: Level 1 Total Level 2 Level 3 000 000 2009 000 000 Assets Fair value through the profit or loss: Embedded derivatives 2,480 2,480 Currency exchange contracts 457 457 2,937 2,937 Available-for-sale: Short-term investments 105,524 105,524 Short-term marketable securities 1,795 1,795 Other long-term investments 9,432 9,432 116,751 107,319 9,432 Total assets 107,319 119,688 2,937 9,432 Level 1 valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.
