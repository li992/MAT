NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of preparation Burberry Group is a luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia Pacific.
Licensing activity is also carried out, principally in Japan.
All of the companies which comprise Burberry Group are owned by Burberry Group plc the Company directly or indirectly.
The consolidated financial statements of Burberry Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which are expected to be relevant to the Groups results, were issued but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating Segments Requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes and regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance.
The Group will be amending its segmental information with effect from 1 April 2009 to comply with this standard.
IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs This revision of an existing standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
It will take effect for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
No material financial impact is anticipated.
IFRS 2 Amendment Share-based payment This revision of an existing standard deals with vesting conditions and cancellations.
It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
All cancellations, whether by the Group or by other parties, will receive the same accounting treatment.
IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of financial statements The amendment clarifies that some rather than all financial assets and liabilities classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement are examples of current assets and liabilities respectively.
It will take effect from 1 January 2009.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of financial statements This revision of an existing standard will prohibit the presentation of items of income and expenses that is, non-owner changes in equity in the statement of changes in equity.
All non-owner changes in equity will be required to be shown in either one performance statement the statement of comprehensive income or two statements the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Where entities restate or reclassify comparative information, they will be required to present a restated balance sheet as at the beginning comparative period.
IFRS 3 Amendment Business combinations The standard will continue to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with certain significant changes.
All payments to purchase a business will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through income.
Goodwill and non-controlling minority interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis.
All transaction costs will be expensed.
It will take effect for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will be applied by the Group to all business combinations with effect from 1 April 2010.
IAS 27 Amendment Consolidated and separate financial statements The amendment removes the definition of the cost method from IAS 27 and has replaced it with a requirement to present dividends as income in the separate financial statements of the investor.
It will take effect from 1 April 2010.
78 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Basis of consolidation The Groups annual financial statements comprise those of the parent Company and its subsidiaries, presented as a single economic entity.
The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period during which Burberry Group plc had control.
The effects of intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements.
Key sources of estimation and judgement Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Such estimates include, but are not limited to impairment of trade and other receivables, goodwill and asset impairment, inventory provisioning, provisions for onerous leases, restructuring provisions and income and deferred taxes.
These are discussed below: Impairment of trade and other receivables A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established where management estimate that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Inventory provisioning The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends.
As a result, it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required.
Inventory provisioning is based on the age and condition of inventory, as well as anticipated saleability.
Provision for onerous leases Provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rentals, are recognised when the property leased becomes vacant and is no longer used in the operations of the business.
Provisions for dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis.
Provision for restructuring Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Income and deferred taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory.
There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which such determination is made.
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 79 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies The consolidated financial information of Burberry Group plc and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The principal accounting policies of the Group are: a Revenue Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied less returns, trade discounts and allowances and royalties receivable.
Wholesale sales are recognised when goods are despatched to trade customers, as this reflects the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership, with provisions made for expected returns and allowances.
Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with customers.
Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return levels.
Royalties receivable from licensees are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes.
b Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
c Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement.
d Share schemes The cost of the share incentives received by employees including directors is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the award made.
The impact of performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except for conditions linked to the price of Burberry Group plc shares i. e. market conditions.
Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium.
e Operating leases Burberry Group is a lessee of property.
Gross rental expenditure in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the leases.
Certain rental expense is determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific retail locations and is accrued for on that basis.
Amounts paid to acquire the rights to a lease Lease premiums are written off in equal annual instalments over the life of the lease contract.
Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are recognised over the term of the lease to the first break clause.
f Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plcs shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
80 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED g Pension costs Defined benefit schemes Eligible employees of Burberry Group participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.
Where arrangements are funded, assets are held in independently administrated trusts.
The cost of providing defined benefit schemes to participating Burberry employees is charged to the Income Statement over the anticipated period of employment.
Net actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly to equity through the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
The asset or liability recognised in the Balance Sheet, in respect of defined benefit schemes, represents Burberrys share of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service costs.
Defined contribution schemes Burberry Group eligible employees also participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an independently administered fund.
The cost of providing these benefits to participating Burberry employees is recognised in the Income Statement and comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
h Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill on acquisition is recorded as an intangible fixed asset.
Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of Burberry Group.
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life.
Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trademarks and trading licences The cost of securing and renewing trademarks and other intellectual property is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset and amortised by equal annual instalments over its useful economic life, typically ten years.
The useful economic life of trademarks and other intellectual property is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement.
Computer software The cost of acquiring computer software including licences and separately identifiable external development costs is capitalised as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its intended use.
Software costs are amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, which are up to five years.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost, based on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Land Not depreciated Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leaseholds less than 50 years expired Over the unexpired term of the lease Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3 8 years Retail fixtures and fittings 2 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment Up to 5 years Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and net book value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional.
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 81 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED j Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
k Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost including an appropriate proportion of production overhead and net realisable value.
Provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the age and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.
l Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is exempt from deferred tax.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated on the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates, as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks reflected in future cash flow estimates.
n Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
o Financial instruments A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset is no longer recognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred.
A financial liability is no longer recognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Groups financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading except where they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals and borrowings.
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and other equivalents.
Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless in a hedging relationship and are held at fair value.
82 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less, held with banks, liquidity funds as well as bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a third party with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables arise when the Group acquires money, goods or services directly from a supplier.
They are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Derivative instruments Burberry Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain trading transactions.
The principal derivative instruments used are forward currency contracts taken out to hedge highly probable cashflows in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases.
To manage interest rate risk Burberry Group manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives.
It has designated foreign currency borrowings in a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : or 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges : or 3 classified as held for trading.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement.
If it is expected that all or a portion of a loss deferred in equity will not be recovered in one or more future periods, or the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount that is not expected to be recovered is reclassified to the Income Statement.
If a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 83 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED p Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the monthly average exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of Burberry Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.
Translation of the results of overseas businesses The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Groups presentation currency of Sterling each month at the weighted average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Groups trading results.
The weighted average exchange rate is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions.
The assets and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
The principal exchange rates used were as follows: Weighted average profit rate Closing rate Year to Year to As at As at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 2009 2008 Euro 1.12 1.42 1.08 1.26 US dollar 1.42 2.02 1.43 1.98 Hong Kong dollar 12.79 15.63 11.10 15.44 Korean won 1,967 1,873 1,967 1,966 The average exchange rate achieved by Burberry Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen forward sale contracts on a monthly basis approximately 12 months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 213.1: 1 in the year to 31 March 2009 2008: Yen 221.5: 1. q Non-GAAP measures Non-GAAP measures are those items that are largely one-off and material in nature and presented in order to provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business.

The total cost associated with the cost efficiency programme was 54.9m.
The Group has impaired the entire goodwill relating to the Spanish business.
This has resulted in an impairment charge of 116.2m in the year to 31 March 2009 see note 10.
The Group has impaired certain retail stores in the US and Europe.
This has resulted in an impairment charge of 10.6m in the year to 31 March 2009 see note 11 and an increase in the provision for onerous leases of 2.8m see note 19.
Negative goodwill of 1.7m arose on the formation of the Burberry Middle East joint venture and is attributable to the excess of the net assets acquired over the cost of the acquisition.
Operating profit for the year to 31 March 2008 included a net profit of 15.1m relating to the Groups relocation of the global headquarters.
In the year to 31 March 2009 the Group has increased the provision for onerous leases in relation to this relocation by 7.9m.
The year to 31 March 2008 included a charge of 19.6m relating to Project Atlas, our major infrastructure redesign initiative.
The core design and build was completed in the year to 31 March 2008 and since then all ongoing costs relating to the deployment of the model are being accounted for within operating costs or capital expenditure as appropriate.

Impairment testing of goodwill The carrying value of the goodwill allocated to cash generating units at 31 March 2009 is: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Spain 101.1 Korea 21.0 21.0 Other 12.1 8.0 Total 33.1 130.1 At 31 March 2009 an impairment provision of 116.2m 2008: nil was recognised in respect of the carrying value of Spain goodwill.
At 30 September 2008 an impairment review was carried out and it was concluded that no impairment was necessary as the recoverable amount of goodwill, based on the value in use, exceeded its carrying value.
The value in use at September was based on the future cashflows of the core Spanish business and the childrenswear division.
Following the significant restructuring of the Spanish operations, management no longer believes it appropriate to include the future cashflows of the Global childrenswear division when calculating the value in use.
The value in use at 31 March 2009 has been based on the pre-tax cashflows for just the core Spanish business.
As a result of the continuing challenging economic environment in Spain and based on managements estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill did not exceed the carrying value, and therefore an impairment has been recognised.
The cashflows were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13.7% 2008: 15.1%, based on the Burberry Group weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the country specific tax rates and risk.
No impairment was recognised in respect of the carrying value of the other goodwill as the recoverable amount of goodwill for each cash generating unit exceeded its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value in use basis.
For Korea the value in use calculation was performed using pre-tax cash flow projections for 2009 10 based on financial plans approved by management.
No growth has been assumed in the cashflow projections beyond this period 2008: nil.
The cash flows were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 16.0% 2008: 14.1%, based on Burberry Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the country specific tax rates and risk.

During the year to 31 March 2009 a net impairment charge of 10.6m 2008: 0.5m release was identified as part of the annual impairment review as a result of trading conditions having become more challenging.
Of the total charge, 5.4m 2008: 1.1m relates to certain retail stores in the US, 4.0m 2008: 1.7m release to certain retail stores in Europe and 1.2m 2008: 0.1m in relation to certain retail stores in Spain.
The impairment charge was based on a review of the value of the assets in use and on pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial plans approved by management and extrapolated beyond the budget year to the lease exit dates using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each countrys economic conditions.
The pre-tax discount rates used in these calculations were between 11.3% and 14.6% 2008: 13.8%, based on Burberry Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the country specific tax rates and risk.
Based on a valuation report prepared by Colliers Conrad Ritblat Erdman, dated 16 May 2006, the existing use value of Burberry Groups nine most significant freehold properties is 179.6m 2008: 136.9m based on closing exchange rates at 31 March 2009.
This valuation is higher than the net book value of these assets.
The directors do not intend to incorporate this valuation into the accounts but set out the valuation for information purposes only.

Derivative financial instruments The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward exchange contracts.
These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedges Burberry Groups foreign currency denominated transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and purchases.
The Group manages these exposures by the use of forward exchange contracts.

On 31 December 2007 Burberry Limited ceased to participate in the Experian Pension Scheme.
Burberry was liable and in April 2008 has paid the debt of 1.25m due under Section 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995.
The following disclosures regarding the Experian defined benefit scheme have been included for completeness of prior year disclosures as required by IAS 19 which were based on valuation assumptions at the beginning of that year and the cash flows for the nine months to 31 December 2007.
A full actuarial valuation of the Experian Pension Scheme was carried out every three years by independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Limited, with interim reviews in the intervening years.
This valuation separately identified the underlying assets and liabilities which related to the Burberry Group.

Share capital and reserves continued During the year to 31 March 2009, no ordinary shares were repurchased and subsequently cancelled by the Company.
A share repurchase programme commenced in January 2005 and since then a total of 79,063,397 ordinary shares have been repurchased and subsequently cancelled.
This represents 15.8% of the original issued share capital at a total cost of 351.8m.
The nominal value of the shares was 39,532 and has been transferred to a capital redemption reserve and the retained earnings have been reduced by 351.8m since this date.
No shares were repurchased in the year to 31 March 2009.
The cost of own shares held in the Burberry Group ESOP Trusts has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Burberry Group and the Company.

Under certain revenue leases, there are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above.
As a result, the amounts charged to the Income Statement may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.
Where rental agreements include a contingent rental, this contingent rent is generally calculated as a percentage of revenue.
Escalation clauses increase the rental to either open market rent, a stipulated amount in the rental agreement, or by an inflationary index percentage.
There are no significant restrictions imposed by these lease agreements.
The total of future minimum sublease payments to be received under non-cancellable subleases is as follows: Land and buildings As at As at 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Amounts falling due: Within one year 0.1 Between two and five years After five years Total 0.1 23.

Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 107 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.
Contingent liabilities Since 31 March 2008 the following changes to material contingent liabilities have occurred: During the year ended 31 March 2009, Burberry Group has not provided any guarantee letters to raw material suppliers.
The total value of these guarantees at 31 March 2008 amounted to 0.4m, which all expired during the period to 30 September 2008.
Other material contingent liabilities reported at 31 March 2008 remain unchanged and were: Under the GUS group UK tax payment arrangements, the Group was jointly and severally liable for any GUS liability attributable to the period of Burberry Groups membership of this payment scheme.
Burberry Groups membership of this scheme was terminated with effect from 31 March 2002.
Burberry Spain S. A. is liable for certain salary and social security contributions left unpaid by its sole contractors where the amounts are attributable to the period in which subcontracting activity is undertaken on behalf of Burberry Spain S. A.
It is not feasible to estimate the amount of contingent liability, but such expense has not been material in prior years.
Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash and short term deposits, external borrowings, as well as trade debtors and creditors, arising directly from operations.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks including foreign exchange risk, price risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably.
This is done in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
The policies of the Group Treasury department are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Burberry Groups Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, Burberry Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward exchange contracts see note 15.
The Groups accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in note 2.
The Groups Treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify as highly probable forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes.
Burberry Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes.
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose.
At 31 March 2009 the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies strengthening weakening by 20% 2008: 5% against Sterling with all other variables held constant.
The effect of translating foreign currency denominated net debt, receivables, payables and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss would have increased decreased post-tax profit for the year by 7.0m 2008: 1.1m.
The effect of translating forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and Sterling denominated loans held in overseas subsidiaries would have decreased increased equity by 20.0m 2008: 6.4m.
The following table shows the extent to which Burberry Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward contracts used to manage currency exposure.
Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or paid in cash.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement.

Financial risk management continued Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities held in currencies other than the local currency of operation: Year to Year to 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Sterling 0.2 1.6 US dollar 47.8 14.5 Euro 0.8 1.5 Other currencies 0.5 40.4 Total 48.9 25.8 Price risk The Group is exposed to employers national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share incentive schemes.
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employers national insurance liability due to movements in the Groups share price, the Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards.
The Group does not seek hedge accounting treatment for equity swaps.
The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employers national insurance liability on an ongoing basis to ensure it remains immaterial.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short term deposits and external borrowings.
The external borrowings are linked to the LIBOR rate, while cash and short term borrowings are affected by local market rates around the Group.
The borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has entered into an interest rate swap, with a notional principal of USD 65m, to convert floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings, at a fixed interest rate of 3.545%.
The interest rate risk profile of Burberry Groups fixed and floating rate financial liabilities by currency, after taking into consideration interest rate swaps, is as follows: Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial liabilities liabilities As at 31 March 2009 m m Sterling 0.1 US dollar 45.4 Total financial liabilities 0.1 45.4 As at 31 March 2008 Sterling 109.3 US dollar 1.4 Other currencies 2.4 Total financial liabilities 113.1 The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2009 and 2008 exclude cash pool overdraft balances of 199.2m 2008: 78.7m.
No interest is payable on all other non-derivative financial liabilities.
At 31 March 2009, if interest rates on Sterling denominated borrowings had been 200 basis points higher lower 2008: 10 basis points with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.7m 2008: 0.1m lower higher, as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
The Group has no other significant floating rate foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not exposed to movements in foreign currency interest rates.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low.
An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 13.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Groups financial assets at the end of the period is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 109 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25.
Financial risk management continued With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short term deposits and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counter party with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
The Group has deposited 2.5m 2008: 2.0m and CHF 0.3m 2008: CHF 0.3m which is held as collateral at a number of European banks.
Liquidity risk The Groups financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
For further details of this, see note 20.

The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.

SAYE share option scheme In the financial year ended 31 March 2007 a Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme offering Burberry Group plc ordinary shares was introduced for employees.
On 26 June 2008 further options were granted under this scheme.
These options are ordinarily exercisable from 1 September 2011 and are dependent on continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period.
The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding the invitation date.
Three day averages are calculated by taking middle market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from the London Stock Exchange.
The fair value of the options granted in the year has been calculated using a risk-free rate of 4.4% 2008: 5.3%, expected volatility of 31.6% 2008: 28.5% and an expected dividend yield of 3.5% 2008: 2.4%.
The fair value per option for the grant was determined as 1.11.
The Burberry share price at the date of grant was 4.48.
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 111 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26.
Employee costs continued Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.
As share price information was only available for Burberry Group plc from July 2002 an average of a comparator group of companies was used prior to this date.
The average expected volatility over the life of the option was used.

No such awards were made either to directors or senior management.
In accordance with the rules of the RSP the awards vest in three stages, 50% are exercisable after three years, 25% are exercisable after four years and 25% are exercisable after five years, subject to the achievement of a specified performance condition.
The performance condition for the awards at the time of the grant was based on three year growth in profit before taxation PBT.
25% of the awards vest if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years rising to 100% if PBT growth is equal to or exceeds 15% per annum over three years to 31 March 2011.
The vesting of the award was also dependent on continued employment over the vesting period.
The exercise price of these share awards is nil.
In March 2009 the Remuneration Committee approved a modification to the performance condition for this award, on the basis that in the current exceptional economic environment the June 2008 award would no longer provide an incentive to management.
