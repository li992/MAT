During the year ended 31 December 2009, one 2008 one hotel was sold.
The remaining four were reclassified as property, plant and equipment at 30 June 2009 when they no longer met the held for sale criteria of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as sales are no longer considered highly probable within the next 12 months.
On reclassification, valuation adjustments of $45m were recognised, comprising $14m of depreciation not charged whilst held for sale and $31m of further write-downs to recoverable amounts, as required by IFRS 5.
Recoverable amounts were assessed by reference to value in use with the expected future cash flows for the North American hotel comprising substantially all of the write-down discounted at a pre-tax rate of 12.5%.
The valuation adjustments are included within impairment on the face of the Group income statement.
The results of two of these reclassified hotels, which, prior to 30 June 2009, were presented as discontinued operations, are now reported as continuing operations and prior period results have been re-presented on a consistent basis.
The impact has been to increase revenue from continuing operations for the year by $34m 2008 $43m and to increase operating profit from continuing operations, before exceptional items, for the year by $8m 2008 $14m.
Discontinued operations Following the above reclassification and re-presentation, the results of discontinued operations comprise gains arising from prior year hotel disposals of $6m 2008 $5m and do not impact on segmental results.
