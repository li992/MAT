NOTES TO ThE cOmpaNy fiNaNcial STaTEmENTS continued 2 Accounting policies continued g Tax The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
h Pensions The Company participates in a Group UK defined benefit scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the Company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme in accordance with the exemptions permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
As a result the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the relevant accounting period.
i Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
j Dividends The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
