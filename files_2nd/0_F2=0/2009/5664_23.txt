Income taxes continued The Republic of Kazakhstan has announced a phased reduction in the applicable rate of CIT from 30% in 2008 to 20% for 20092012, 17.5% for 2013 and 15% thereafter.
Changes to the applicable CIT rates enacted in November 2009 resulted in remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2009 and a debit to the income tax charge of US$16 million.
Changes enacted in December 2008 resulted in a credit to the income tax charge for 2008 of US$177 million.
MET is being phased in to broadly offset the reduction in the applicable CIT rate for subsurface users.
However, MET, not being a tax on profits, forms part of cost of sales and is not reported as part of the income tax expense.
Tax charge reconciliation Reconciliation between the actual tax charge for the period and the expected tax charge on the profit before tax for the period at the tax rate of 20% applicable in the Republic of Kazakhstan, where the majority of the Groups operations are located, is provided below.

Shubarkol is majority owned by EFIC, a private company controlled by the Founder Shareholders of the Group.
In connection with the acquisition, the Group has entered into an off-take agreement with Shubarkol, secured a seat on Shubarkols board and entered into a shareholders agreement with EFIC.
In addition the Group has a right of first refusal, combined with a call option, over all or part of the remaining shares in Shubarkol held by EFIC.
The call option is exercisable at the Groups discretion at any time until 31 January 2011 which, if exercised will be subject to required regulatory approvals having been obtained and is expected to be subject to the approval of the Groups shareholders.
The price payable on any exercise of the call option is the aggregate value of the shares to be transferred, assuming Shubarkol has a total value of US$800 million on a fully diluted basis, less any net debt at the time of the transfer.
Because the call option is subject to the approvals noted above, it is not readily exercisable or convertible and hence the possession of the call option does not contribute to control over Shubarkol, the Group accounted for its investment in Shubarkol using equity accounting in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.

Derivative financial instruments Forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into in order to mitigate foreign exchange currency risk arising from highly probable forecast transactions.
The foreign exchange contracts were designated as cash flow hedge instruments and their fair value recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
All forward foreign exchange contracts expired during the year ended 31 December 2009, reducing the financial instruments liability as at December 2009 to nil 2008: US$54 million.

Rental tax is included in Distribution expenses.
Other taxes payable include property, environmental and other taxes.
Share-based payments The Group has established a LTIP with a view to attracting, retaining and motivating the Executive Directors and selected senior management.
The LTIP share awards are equity-settled share-based payment transactions which vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to achievement of performance targets.
The LTIP performance target is based on the Groups total shareholder return, ranked against a comparator group of other international mining companies over a three year period.
Further information on the LTIP is disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 55.
In circumstances where an employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date for reasons except dismissal, the Board has the discretion to allow the employees award to vest to the extent they deem the performance target would have been satisfied if pro rated to the date of cessation of employment.
Details of grants and assumptions in the calculation of fair value under the LTIP are set out in the table below: Grant 1 Grant 2 Grant date 7 May 2008 20 April 2009 Fair value per share in British pounds 8.47 3.97 Share price at grant date in British pounds 12.10 5.489 1 Estimated average volatility 42% 70% 2 Estimated dividend yield 1.01% 3.82% 3 Risk free interest rate 2.55% 1.27% Vesting period 3 years 3 years 1 The Groups estimated share price volatility is based on the historical average annualised volatility of the comparator group of mining companies and reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the awards is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The increase in volatility for Grant 2 was due to the changes in market conditions over an historical period similar to the life of the awards.
2 The estimated dividend yield for Grant 2 was based on the Groups historical dividend payments.
For Grant 1, the expected dividend yield was deemed to be the average of the comparator group of mining companies as ENRC had not paid any dividends prior to grant date of Grant 1.
3 The risk-free interest rate is a government bond rate of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed, over a period similar to the life of the awards.
The decrease in the risk free rate in 2009 was due to market fluctuations.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the LTIP is calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group may use derivative financial instruments to partially hedge foreign exchange exposure.
Financial risk management is the responsibility of the treasury function which identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating units.
The Treasury Policy outlines principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and nonderivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Credit risk The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group has credit insurance for the majority of its sales.
Credit limits are set by the Group in accordance with limits provided by the Credit Insurance Company.
Credit insurance is no longer available in respect of the Groups Russian customers.
The development of the Groups relationship with its two largest Russian customers, MMK and UC Rusal, is described in the Operating Review.
The Group undertakes rigorous credit control procedures which are closely monitored by the Head of Sales and the Chief Financial Officer.
These procedures are regularly reviewed in light of the limited availability of credit insurance.
As a general rule, for those sales to non-major customers where credit insurance is not available, the Group operates a policy of cash on delivery and letters of credit.
The Group has established relationships with a number of international and domestic banks in the areas in which the Group operates to diversify credit risk.
Individual credit limits are assigned to each counterparty according to an analysis of financial strength or published credit rating.
Limits and exposures to each counterparty are regularly monitored and reported at each Board meeting.
During the year a mixture of bank deposits, liquidity funds, asset management funds and sovereign debt were used within the Groups investment portfolio to manage credit exposure.
Individual counterparty exposure limits are based on entity credit ratings published by at least one of the major credit rating agencies where available.
Our policy is to invest cash and cash equivalents with highly rated banks and with AAA rated liquidity funds.
The Groups Treasury policy prescribes the maximum limits that are available for investment purposes with any individual counterparty.
For operational and investment purposes in Kazakhstan, there are a limited number of counterparties with an independent credit rating.
The process of evaluating Kazakhstani counterparty credit limits is based on the results of synthetic ratio calculations derived from relevant financial data for each counterparty.
The resultant counterparty credit limits are reviewed frequently and amended as appropriate to meet the changing business environment in which the Group operates.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk related to the uncollateralised balances to be as follows: As at 31 December In millions of US$ Note 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents 25 830 2,493 Trade and other receivables excluding prepaid expenses and taxes 24 722 721 Loans receivable 21 175 72 Financial assets 20 115 84 Total maximum credit risk exposure 1,842 3,370 ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 101 34.
Financial risk management continued The maximum exposure to credit risk for Trade receivables excluding prepaid expenses and taxes, cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable and other financial assets by geographic region is as follows: Years ended 31 December 2009 Cash and Other cash Trade Loans financial In millions of US$ equivalents receivable receivable assets Eurasia 668 278 27 14 Europe and Middle East 146 159 61 Asia Pacific 241 Rest of the world 16 44 148 40 Total 830 722 175 115 Years ended 31 December 2008 Cash and Other cash Trade Loans financial In millions of US$ equivalents receivables receivable assets Eurasia 717 355 15 78 Europe and Middle East 1,776 207 Asia Pacific 153 Rest of the world 6 57 6 Total 2,493 721 72 84 In 2009 the top 10 customers as a proportion of the outstanding balance of the Groups trade receivables accounted for 65 % 2008: 51%.
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due by up to 60 days.
The top 10 customers have a good payment record with the Group.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups production costs are denominated in Kazakhstani tenge and Russian roubles while sales are denominated in US dollars.
The Group is therefore exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates will affect both its operating profit and cash flows.
The Groups foreign currency exposure arises from: highly probable forecast transactions sales purchases denominated in foreign currencies: and monetary items mainly intercompany receivables, payables and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign currency risks were partially mitigated through forward foreign exchange contracts which were deemed to be effective hedges on highly probable forecast transactions that achieved an average exchange rate.
All forward exchange contracts expired at 31 December 2009.
There were no additional foreign exchange hedges transacted during the year.
The table below summarises the foreign currency exposure on the net monetary position of each Group entity against its respective functional currency, expressed in the Groups presentation currency.

Devaluation of Kazakhstani tenge The devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge in early February 2009 gave risk to significant one-off foreign exchange movements on the revaluation of US dollar denominated balances in the Kazakhstani operations, primarily inter-company receivables and loans, and term deposits.
Consequently, the Group recognised net foreign exchange gains of US$210 million and US$104 million included in net other operating income note 11 and finance income note 13, respectively, and a foreign exchange loss of US$75 million included in finance costs note 14.
Separately, in the Groups balance sheet the devaluation impact on net assets was reflected in a significant one-off reduction of about US$1.3 billion in the currency translation reserve within equity.
Commodity price risk The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities, primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina and aluminium.
Historically, the prices of these products have been volatile and have fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional economies and cyclicality in industries that are end users of these products.
Prices may also be affected by government actions, including the imposition of tariffs and import duties, speculative trades, the development of product substitutes or replacements, recycling practices, an increase in capacity or an oversupply of the Groups products in its main markets.
These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it difficult to estimate future prices.
A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect the Groups business and the financial results and cash flows of operations.
The Group does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of its products.
The table below sets out the sensitivity of the Groups Underlying EBITDA to changes in commodity prices: The 5% reduction in sales price, relative to the average for the year, would reduce Underlying EBITDA by: In millions of US$ 2009 2008 High carbon ferrochrome 55 112 Chrome ore 6 18 Iron ore 53 72 Alumina 16 26 Aluminium 10 13 Interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
These assets and liabilities are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk or fair value interest rate risk depending on whether they are subject to variable or fixed rates of interest.
The objective of interest rate risk management is to manage and control interest rate risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable interest rate borrowings.
The Groups significant interest bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 20, 21, 24, 25, and 27.

Financial risk management continued An increase decrease of 1% in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2009 by US$7 million 2008: US$17 million.
The impact on equity is the same as the impact on income.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, remain constant.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group intends to maintain a capital structure in line with industrys norms and practices which will be achieved over a period of time, taking into account investment opportunities and availability of debt finance.
The Group considers the following balances as a part of its capital management: As at 31 December In millions of US$ Note 2009 2008 Borrowings 27 428 727 Share capital and share premium 26 3,257 3,257 1 Reserves 4,456 4,915 Total capital 8,141 8,899 1 Reserves include retained earnings, translation reserve, hedge reserve, and revaluation reserve of financial assets available-for-sale.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to manage its debt level.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The table below summarises the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities which will be settled on a gross basis and derivative financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
