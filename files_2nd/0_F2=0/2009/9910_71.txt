Currency risk management net asset exposure As indicated on page 20, it is the objective of the Group to minimise currency risk by hedging its currency exposure.
The Group operates significant businesses in Continental Europe, denominated in Euros and other European currencies.
The Group has exposure to movements in exchange rates on net assets.
In order to hedge these exposures the Group arranges foreign currency funding, both internal and external, and uses forward contracts to hedge part of the remaining net exposure to foreign currency assets in line with Group policy.
The net asset exposure and the effect of the rolling forward contracts is shown below.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders and issue new shares or buy back existing shares.
The Group is committed to maintaining a debt equity capital structure that is sufficiently robust so as to ensure continued access to a broad range of financing sources and thus be able to maintain sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities.
To enable this the Group monitors a range of financial measures including net debt, net interest cover, debt cover and gearing.
