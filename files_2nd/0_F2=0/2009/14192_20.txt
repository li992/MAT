Shires mission is to be the most valuable specialty biopharmaceutical company in the world that focuses on enabling people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives.

The Financial review also provides a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and the Group as well as risk management objectives and policies.
Details of the Companys risks can be found in Note N to the financial statements.
During the year the Company continued in its capacity as the parent company for the Shire Group in the management of its subsidiaries.
Key performance indicators The Companys key performance indicator is return on investments.
The Group manages its business on a product division basis and for this reason the Companys Directors believe that further key performance indicators for the Company are not necessary or appropriate for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the business.
For details of the Groups key performance indicators see page 12 in the Financial review of the Shire Annual Report.
The Company is resident for tax purposes in Ireland.
Income Access Share arrangements In 2008 Shire put in place and continues to operate Income Access Share IAS arrangements enabling shareholders to choose whether they receive their dividends from a company resident for tax purposes in Ireland or from a Company resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom UK.
Further details in respect of the IAS arrangements can be found in Note 25 of the Shire Annual Report.
Results and dividends A loss on ordinary activities before taxation of $87.1 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2009 period ended December 31, 2008: $42.7 million.
The net assets of the Company decreased marginally from $9,721.4 million for the period ended December 31, 2008 to $9,690.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the loss the Company made in 2009.
Dividends paid and dividend policy The Company paid dividends amounting to $8.5 million in the year 2008: $3.1 million.
In accordance with IAS arrangements, the Company directed Old Shire to pay dividends totaling $45.9 million 2008: $7.2 million to those shareholders who choose to receive their dividends from a company resident for tax purposes in the UK.
A first interim dividend for the first half of 2009 of 2.147 US cents 1.302 pence per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 6.441 US cents per ADS, was paid in October 2009.
The Board has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 9.250 US cents 5.910 pence per Ordinary Share equivalent to 27.750 US cents per ADS for the six months to December 31, 2009.
This is consistent with Shires stated policy of paying a dividend semi-annually, set in US cents per Ordinary Share.
It is intended that the first interim payment each year should be the higher of the previous years first interim US dollar dividend and the US dollar equivalent of the previous years Pound sterling first interim dividend.
Dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim dividend is determined.
Any dividend growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 131 Liquidity, cash flow and going concern The Company and the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chairmans review, Chief Executive Officers review and Financial review on pages 2 to 31 of the Shire Annual Report.
The financial position of the Company and the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Liquidity and capital resources section of the Financial review of the Shire Annual Report.
The Financial review also includes information in respect of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its hedging activity: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Details of the Companys financial instruments are disclosed in Note N of these financial statements.
The Groups balance sheet includes $498.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009.
The Group has no debt maturing in the next two years and substantially all of the Groups debt relates to its $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bond which matures in 2014, although these bonds include a put option which could require repayment of the bonds in 2012.
In addition, the Group has a committed facility until 2012 of $1,200 million, which is currently undrawn.
The current financial situation affecting the banking system and financial markets, together with the current uncertainty in global economic conditions, has resulted in tighter credit markets and a lower level of liquidity in many financial markets.
As a result, the Group may not be able to access new equity or debt finance at the same level or cost as it has done previously.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic climate, and to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the report and financial statements.
The Directors who served during the year and up to the date of signing these financial statements are shown below: MW Emmens AC Russell GC Hetherington DJ Kappler PJM Langlois JM Leiden KA Nealon DM Stout appointed October 31, 2009 D Mott resigned October 30, 2009 M Rosenblatt resigned December 23, 2009 BJ Price resigned January 24, 2010 Auditors Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this report confirms that: so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware: and the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

They have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Consolidated accounts prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP, in which the financial results and cash flow statement of the Company and its subsidiaries are included, can be found in the Shire Annual Report.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companys accounting policies described below, which have been applied consistently throughout the current year and preceding period and have been approved by the Board.
B ACCOUNTING POLICIES Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
Dividends paid and received Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognized as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
This occurs in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders, or in the case of an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognized in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Foreign currency transactions Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates the functional currency.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet dates are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at that date.
Share-based compensation The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options has been valued using option-pricing models.
Options and performance share awards granted without market conditions are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Options and performance share awards granted with market conditions are valued using a binomial model.
In accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payment, the resulting cost for the Companys employees are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting.
The cost for awards granted to the Companys subsidiaries employees represents additional capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries.
An additional investment in subsidiaries has been recorded in respect of those awards granted to the Companys subsidiaries employees, with a corresponding increase in the Companys shareholders equity.
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value at the grant date of the awards issued, allocated over the life of the underlying grants vesting period.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognized in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognized only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 137 B ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Related party transactions Under the provisions of FRS 8 Related party disclosures, as the consolidated financial statements in which the Companys results are included have been made available to the public, the Company is not required to separately disclose details of related party transactions with other Group undertakings in the financial statements.
Pensions The Company contributes to personal defined contribution pension plans of employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Convertible bonds On issuance, or substitution from other Shire Group companies, of convertible bonds the Company bifurcates these convertible bonds into their debt and equity components.
The fair value of the debt component is estimated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The amount allocated to the debt component is classified as a liability and subsequently measured on an amortized cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds from the issuance, or the fair value on substitution from other Shire Group companies, of convertible bonds is allocated to the equity component, which represents the embedded conversion option, and is classified in shareholders equity, net of any income tax effects.
The carrying amount of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent periods.

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk: liquidity risk: and market risk including foreign currency exchange risk, price risk and interest rate risk.
The Groups overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Groups financial risk management and principal treasury operations are co-ordinated by its corporate treasury function.
All treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the Board.
As a matter of policy, the Company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
For further details of Shires risk management policies see the Business review in the Shire Annual Report.
Credit risk As at December 31, 2009 the Company had amounts due from Group undertakings totaling $1,416.3 million.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk from these amounts is $1,416.3 million.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Company finances its activities through cash generated from private and public offerings of equity, debt securities and committed bank facilities and borrowings and the repayment of loans from Shire Group companies.
The Company anticipates that its funding sources will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses, debt principal and service costs and dividend obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.
The current financial situation which is affecting the banking system and financial markets, together with the current uncertainty in global economic conditions, have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets and a low level of liquidity in many financial markets.
As a result, the Company may not be able to access new equity or debt finance at the same level or cost as it has done previously.

What was once the ADHD company has now become one of the worlds most successful specialty biopharmaceutical companies.
An operation covering only nine markets now extends to 28, with more coming soon.
A pipeline with great potential has become one thats delivering solid results, and a narrow research focus has expanded into leading-edge expertise in pioneering technologies like human cell line biologics and Carrierwave technology.
2 Shire plc Annual Review 2009 The quick read Any other company would be talking about transformation, and in many ways thats the right word to use.
But for Shire, this is just another stage in a continuous process that started over ten years ago.
Weve built this company by turning foresight into insight in other words, by identifying the emerging trends in our sector, and having the courage to act on that knowledge.
We saw the opportunity for specialty pharmaceuticals, and moved quickly to occupy that space.
We predicted the impact of generics, and the growing pressure on drug pricing, and made sure we had the pipeline and business model to deal with it.
Shire plc Annual Review 2009 3 The same thing is happening now: We can see the big pharma model has outlived its useful life, and we continue to position Shire to take full advantage of the new trends that will shape our industry over the next decade.
And just as before, this will be about practical, effective decision-making that builds momentum and keeps us ahead of the curve.
So yes, weve transformed this company out of all recognition, but we prefer to see it as what we do every day: Raising the bar ever higher for Shire.
4 Shire plc Annual Review 2009 The quick read Weve built Shire into one of the most successful specialty biopharmaceutical companies in the world by delivering solid returns for our shareholders, and helping people with life-altering conditions lead better lives.

Like most CEOs, I get my fair share of invitations to speak Phase I: at conferences.
The focus is usually on new trends in our own Developing the model industry but some look more broadly at business strategy, Our business model has always been one of the most important marketing, or change management.
Whatever the banner, theres keys to our success.
The way we exploit that model is evolving one single question I get asked more often than any other: how over time, especially as we grow internationally, but our have we managed to take a small specialty pharmaceutical startbasic approach has remained unchanged for many years: up, and turn it into one of the major world players in that field?
a focus on specialist physicians, niche markets, unmet needs Its true that when you look at where Shire is today, and compare and symptomatic conditions where the impact of a successful it with where we were even five years ago, the scale of the change treatment is immediate and tangible.
This strategy started out is pretty extraordinary, and those of us who have been part of that as a positive response to a very practical business challenge change can sometimes underestimate just how far weve come.
how do you build a successful pharmaceutical company when you have neither the resources to undertake large-scale high-risk 2009 was an important year for usin many ways a watershed research, nor the sales infrastructure to compete in mainstream yearbecause the results weve achieved in the last twelve therapy areas in primary care.
Shire decided that the smart months are the direct result of a clear strategy thats been in answer was to focus on lower-risk research and development, place from the start, but has gained real momentum in the last and make maximum use of the oral drug delivery know-how five years.
So it seems a good time to look again at the Shire we already had in Pharmavene, a business we acquired in 1997 story, because the sort of thinking thats producing strong results and renamed Shire Laboratories.
today is also shaping the way were positioning the business for the next phase of our growth.
Shire Laboratories had the expertise to re-examine existing drugs and formulations like ADDERALL, and explore whether they could be delivered in a more efficient form.
For example, if the required dosage could be reduced to once a day from three or four times, Shire plc Annual Review 2009 11 US GAAP highlights Revenues $3,008M Operating income $620M Net income $492M Diluted earnings per ADS $2.69 the drug would be more convenient for the patientthis was that had initially worked well enough for Shire in the US was the genesis of ADDERALL XR.
This approach proved to be an going to prove more challenging in building a platform for growth extremely effective way of developing new drugs for a company at in other international markets.
This was a pivotal moment: our stage of development, because the chemical formulations we if Shire could no longer benefit from reasonable exclusivity periods were working on had already been through their safety trials, which for drugs like ADDERALL XR, or sell them at a price that would meant we could get new versions to market quickly, and start recover the investment, we would need a new approach.
generating the revenues we needed to re-invest in the business.
ADDERALL became the worlds leading ADHD treatment in April Phase II: 2000, with over 30% of the then $1 billion US ADHD market.
New technologies, new markets When ADDERALL XR was launched in 2001, it rapidly achieved In 2003, the Board took a long hard look at where we were and a 26% share of a market that was worth around $4 billion by the how we were going to grow the business going forward.
Shire was becoming a significant industry player: sold a range of reformulated drugs in the US, and a number of but by 2002 it was obvious to usif not to the rest of the other small-scale treatments on a market-by-market basis in the marketthat the world was starting to change.
There were no global drugs, which meant no international economies of scale.
So we went back and re-evaluated the With hindsight, it seems obvious that generics were going to feasibility of high-risk early-stage research, and dismissed it again have an enormous and irreversible impact on the industry, but few for the same reasons we had before.
We then re-examined our people could have anticipated how wide that impact would be, basic specialty pharma business model and decided that the or how quickly it would take effect.
The pharmaceutical sector has rationale behind it was still soundbut we needed another way always worked within the constraints of limited-life patents, and it of delivering it.
The challenge now was to sell our products on was no secret that some of the worlds big blockbuster drugs were a global basis, at a price that made them economically viable.
going to come off patent in the late 90s.
What did surprise people We also realized that reformulated products are vulnerable was the way the generic manufacturers used this opportunity to generic challenges, and that new chemical entities have to start challenging existing patents for the first time: the dynamics the benefit of longer periods of US regulatory exclusivity.
True of the entire pharmaceutical market were about to change.
innovation and foresight in new therapies was the way forward.
Around this time our work on developing anagrelide AGRYLIN We soon saw exactly what this was going to mean in practice.

Most pharmaceutical companies derive at least a third of their revenue from the US: at Shire this percentage was once as high as 80-85%.

Our aim is to be making half our Shire plc Annual Review 2009 13 CARRIERWAVE TECHNOLOGY Carrierwave is a technology acquired as part of the acquisition of New River Pharmaceuticals NRP and is used in VYVANSE.
Since its acquisition, Shire scientists have significantly improved the understanding and breadth of this technology.
It potentially allows Shire to develop New Chemical Entities NCEs, but with less risk, as the products will be based on the understanding of known products which we seek to improve.
Carrierwave NCEs are thus designed to have improved safety tolerability, efficacy and or pharmacokinetic profiles when compared to the original existing productsignificantly enhancing their potential medical utility and value.
The first successful application of Carrierwave technology is VYVANSE for ADHD launched in the US in 2007.
Shire has a number of Carrierwave NCEs presently in development across several key therapeutic areas including ADHD and sees applicability of this technology in supplementing the pipelines of both Shire businesses Specialty and HGT.

Shire plc Summary Financial Information 2009 3 The Companys management analyzes product sales growth for certain products sold in markets outside of the US on a constant exchange rate CER basis, so that product sales growth can be considered excluding movements in foreign exchange rates.
Product sales growth on a CER basis is a Non GAAP financial measure, computed by comparing 2009 product sales restated using 2008 average foreign exchange rates to 2008 actual product sales.
SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS VYVANSEADHD The increase in VYVANSE product sales was driven by higher US prescription demand in 2009 compared to 2008, 9% growth in the US ADHD market and price increases.
Product sales growth was lower than prescription growth due to lower stocking in 2009 compared to 2008.
INTUNIVADHD INTUNIV was launched in the US in November 2009.
In line with Shires revenue recognition policy for launch shipments, initial stocking shipments have been deferred and are being recognized into revenue in line with end-user prescription demand.
At December 31, 2009 deferred revenues on the balance sheet represented gross sales of $38.8 million.
ADDERALL XRADHD The launch by Teva and Impax of their authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR led to the expected decline in 2009 of branded ADDERALL XR prescription demand, and resulted in higher US sales deductions in 2009 compared to 2008.
These factors more than offset the positive impacts of price increases taken since the fourth quarter of 2008, and the inclusion in product sales of shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax in 2009.
Sales deductions represented 47% of branded ADDERALL XR gross sales in the year to December 31, 2009 compared to 25% in the same period in 2008, following higher Medicaid and Managed Care rebates subsequent to the authorized generic launches.
There are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax should be included in the Medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to Medicaid rebate legislation, including the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 Medicaid rebate legislation.
As a result more than one unit rebate amount URA is calculable for the purpose of determining the Groups Medicaid rebate liability to States after the authorized generic launch.
During 2009 the Group highlighted the different interpretations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS and submitted data to the CMS for the purpose of computing the URA, based on the Groups reasonable interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance.
The State Medicaid agencies have invoiced the Group for Medicaid rebates, and the Group has paid these Medicaid rebate invoices, based on this URA.
Despite this CMS has the ability to subsequently challenge the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, and require an alternative interpretation to be applied both retrospectively and prospectively, which could result in a significantly higher Medicaid liability.
Throughout 2009 the Groups management has recorded its accrual for Medicaid rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable.
For the first three quarters of 2009, the Groups management based this best estimate on an amount that the Group could pay were CMS to challenge the Groups interpretation and require an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation to be applied.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Groups management lowered its best estimate of the Medicaid rebate payable down to be consistent with i the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, ii the Groups repeated and consistent submission of price reporting to CMS using the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, iii CMS calculating the URA based on that interpretation, iv States submitting Medicaid rebate invoices using this URA and v Shire paying these invoices.
This change of estimate increased ADDERALL XR product sales by $97.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 of which $73.6 million related to ADDERALL XR product sales recognized in the first three quarters of 2009.
In determining its best estimate of the Medicaid rebate liability at December 31, 2009 the Groups management has considered a number of factors taken in combination including the receipt of a further quarters invoices from the States with a URA based on the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance, and the Groups likely response were CMS to employ an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation.
Any future change in the Groups interpretation which results in a change of estimate could significantly decrease sales of ADDERALL XR in the period of any such change in estimate.
The Group strongly believes that its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation is reasonable and correct.
However, CMS could disagree with the Groups interpretation, and require the Group to apply an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and pay up to $210 million above the recorded liability.
This would represent a URA substantially in excess of the unit sales price of ADDERALL XR and accordingly be in excess of the approximate amount of the full cost to the States of reimbursement for Medicaid prescriptions of ADDERALL XR.
Should CMS take such an approach, the Group could seek to limit any additional payments to a level approximating the full, un-rebated cost to the States of ADDERALL XR, or $98 million above the recorded liability.
Further, the Group believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, and that there would be a strong basis to initiate litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of its recorded liability.
The result of any such litigation cannot be predicted and could result in additional rebate liability above the Groups current best estimate.
4 Shire plc Summary Financial Information 2009 Financial review LIALDA MEZAVANTUlcerative colitis Strong product sales of LIALDA MEZAVANT continued in the year to December 31, 2009 driven by an increase in market share over 2008, growth in the US oral mesalamine market and price increases taken during 2009.
PENTASAUlcerative colitis Product sales of PENTASA continued to grow despite a decrease in US prescription demand in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the impact of price increases taken during 2009.
 Product sales increased as FOSRENOL entered new countries and grew in existing markets outside the US.
In the US, FOSRENOL sales grew despite lower prescriptions due to a price increase in 2009.
Litigation proceedings regarding certain Shire patents are ongoing.
Further information about these litigations can be found in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year to December 31, 2009.
HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES ELAPRASEHunter syndrome The growth in sales of ELAPRASE was driven by increased volumes across all regions where ELAPRASE is sold.
On a Non GAAP constant exchange rate basis sales grew by 20% 66% of ELAPRASE sales are made outside of the US.
REPLAGALFabry disease The growth in REPLAGAL product sales in 2009 over 2008 was driven by a significant increase in demand in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to an acceleration of patients switching to REPLAGAL in the EU, attributable in part to supply shortages of a competitor product.
Sales increased 16% on a Non GAAP constant exchange rate basis REPLAGAL is sold primarily in Euros and Pounds sterling.
Royalties Royalty revenue increased by 19% to $292.5 million for the year to December 31, 2009 2008: $245.5 million.
1 2 3TC HIV infection and AIDS and ZEFFIX Chronic hepatitis B infection Shire receives royalties from GSK on worldwide 3TC and ZEFFIX sales which decreased mainly due to competition from other HIV and hepatitis B treatments.
ADDERALL XRADHD Royalties were received on Tevas sales of an authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR between April 2009 and September 2009, and on Impaxs sales of an authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR from October 2009.
Other Other royalties are received primarily on worldwide excluding UK and Republic of Ireland sales of REMINYL and REMINYL XL known as RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US.
Royalties on sales of these products decreased in the year to December 31, 2009 to $47.7 million 2008: $63.5 million due to generic competition in the US from August 2008.
Cost of product sales Cost of product sales decreased to $388.0 million for the year to December 31, 2009 14% of product sales, down from $408.0 million in the corresponding period in 2008 2008: 15% of product sales.
Cost of product sales in the year to December 31, 2008 included charges relating to DYNEPO exit costs of $48.8 million 2% of product sales.
Excluding this item, cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in 2009 compared to 2008 has increased by 1% to 14%.
This increase primarily resulted from changes in product mix following the launch by Teva and Impax of their authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR in 2009.
Higher sales deductions on Shires sales of branded ADDERALL XR, together with lower margin sales of the authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax have both depressed gross margins in 2009.
For the year to December 31, 2009 cost of product sales included depreciation of $21.8 million 2008: $16.2 million.
Depreciation charged in 2009 is higher than 2008 due to accelerated depreciation of $12.0 million in 2009 following a change in the estimate of the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment at Shires Owings Mills facility as a result of the anticipated closure of the facility in 2011.
Shire plc Summary Financial Information 2009 5 Research and development R&D R&D expenditure increased by 29% to $638.3 million in the year to December 31, 2009 24% of product sales, up from $494.3 million in the corresponding period in 2008 18% of product sales.
R&D for the year to December 31, 2009 included a charge of $36.9 million 1% of product sales relating to the amendment of an INTUNIV in-license agreement and costs of $62.9 million 2% of product sales following the agreement with Duramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to terminate the Womens Health development agreement.
R&D in the year to December 31, 2008 included costs of $6.5 million for DYNEPO exit costs.
Excluding these items, R&D increased in the year to December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to continued investment in R&D programs, including the acceleration of investment in VPRIV and REPLAGAL in the US, and the inclusion within R&D of an upfront payment of $6.5 million to Santaris Pharma A S for technology access and R&D funding.
For the year to December 31, 2009 R&D included depreciation of $15.5 million 2008: $12.5 million.
Selling, general and administrative SG&A SG&A expenses decreased to $1,342.6 million 50% of product sales for the year to December 31, 2009 from $1,455.2 million 53% of product sales in the corresponding period in 2008.
The decrease was due to the Companys continued focus on cost management, and lower intangible asset impairment charges in the year to December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.
SG&A in the year to December 31, 2009 includes intangible asset amortization of $136.9 million 2008: $126.2 million, the increase resulting from a full year amortization of the FIRAZYR intangible asset.
Intangible asset impairment charges in the year to December 31, 2009 were $nil 2008: $97.1 million.
Impairment charges in 2008 included $94.6 million related to DYNEPO which the Company ceased to commercialize.

Also included in IPR&D in 2008 was a charge of $135.0 million relating to the acquisition of METAZYM from Zymenex A S. The IPR&D charge in respect of FIRAZYR relates to the US $64.9 million and the Rest of the World ROW $64.8 million markets.
In the US FIRAZYR received a not approvable letter from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA in April 2008, and in certain ROW territories it has not been approved by the regulatory authorities.
Reorganization costs For the year to December 31, 2009 Shire recorded reorganization costs of $12.7 million 2008: $nil relating to the transfer of manufacturing from its Owings Mills facility.

Interest income for the year to December 31, 2009 is lower than the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower average interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower average cash and cash equivalent balances.
Interest expense For the year to December 31, 2009 the Company incurred interest expense of $39.8 million 2008: $139.0 million.
Interest expense in 2009 primarily related to interest expense on the Companys convertible bonds totaling $33.3 million 2008: $33.3 million.
Interest expense in 2008 was higher than 2009 due to interest expense of $87.3 million recorded in respect of the Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. TKT appraisal rights litigation, of which $73.0 million was additional interest arising from the settlement of the litigation in November 2008.
6 Shire plc Summary Financial Information 2009 Financial review Other income expense, net For the year to December 31, 2009 the Company recognized Other income, net of $60.7 million.
Other income in 2009 includes a gain of $55.2 million on disposal of the Companys investment in Virochem Pharma Inc. Virochem to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Vertex in a cash and stock transaction.
Shire received total consideration of $19.2 million in cash and two million Vertex shares valued at $50.8 million at the date these shares were acquired.
Other income, net in 2009 also includes a gain of $5.7 million on the substantial modification of a property lease.

Offsetting this in 2008 is a gain of $9.4 million from the disposal of the Companys available-for-sale investment in Questcor Pharmaceutical Inc. Questcor for cash consideration.
Taxation In the year to December 31, 2009 the effective tax rate was 22% 2008: 37%.
Excluding the impact of IPR&D charges of $263.1 million in 2008, which are either not tax deductible or for which no tax benefit is currently recognized, the effective tax rate in 2008 was 19%.
The effective rate of tax in 2009 was higher than 2008 excluding the impact of IPR&D charges due to increased profits in higher tax territories, and the recognition of valuation allowances against EU and US deferred tax assets.
These factors more than offset reductions to the effective rate of tax in 2009 due to: the decrease in valuation allowances relating to state tax credits and loss carry forwards following Massachusetts State tax changes in 2009: the benefit of the effect of the change in the effective state tax rate on the net state deferred tax balance: and higher R&D tax credits in the US, principally the acceleration of the VPRIV program.
Discontinued operations The loss from discontinued operations for the year to December 31, 2009 was $12.4 million 2008: $17.6 million.
The loss in 2009 related to net losses on discontinued Jerini businesses which were either divested or closed during the second quarter of 2009, the loss on disposal of Jerinis Peptides business and the write-off of assets previously classified as held-for-sale.

4 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS EQUASYM IR and XL On March 31, 2009 the Company acquired the worldwide rights excluding the US, Canada and Barbados to EQUASYM IR and XL for the treatment of ADHD from UCB Pharma Limited UCB for cash consideration of $72.8 million.
Included within the recognized purchase price for the acquisition is further consideration of $18.2 million, which may become payable in 2010 and 2011 if certain sales targets are met.
This acquisition has broadened the scope of Shires ADHD portfolio and facilitated immediate access to the European ADHD market as well as providing Shire the opportunity to enter additional markets around the world.
The acquisition of EQUASYM IR and XL has been accounted for as a business combination.
The purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to the currently marketed products acquired $73.0 million, IPR&D $5.5 million, other liabilities $0.7 million and goodwill $13.2 million.
5 RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Subsequent to the issuance of the Companys financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, the Companys management determined that its non-current deferred tax liabilities were overstated by $29 million, following a misstatement in computing the temporary difference between the tax and book value of its other intangible assets.
The Company has corrected this misstatement by restating its previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.
This prior period adjustment does not affect the Companys net income or earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The effect of correcting this misstatement has decreased the Companys accumulated deficit at January 1, 2008 by $29 million and has reduced non-current deferred tax liabilities by a corresponding amount.
The restatement does not affect the Companys net income or cash flows in the year to December 31, 2008.
Shire plc Summary Financial Information 2009 13 Summary Directors remuneration report Introduction This summary Directors remuneration report outlines the Companys remuneration policy and approach as developed by the Remuneration Committee the Committee, and provides the annual remuneration of the Board in 2009.
Pound sterling denominated amounts are converted to US dollar amounts at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 of 1:$1.5647 2008: 1:$1.8542 unless otherwise stated.
Remuneration policy The Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy, aligned to the Companys business needs, is important to the Companys success.
It directly impacts the Companys ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees of the highest caliber who will be able to deliver sustained value to shareholders, even in the most challenging times.
In 2009 the Committee approved the Total Rewards Guiding Principles for reward programs for all employees, including Executive Directors, senior leadership, and the broader employee population.
The guiding principles are: Guiding Principle Description Simple and understandable Each element of the package has a clear purpose Plan drivers are easily understood by participants Pay decisions are not mechanistic Plans are simple to implement Plans are transparent and easily communicated Competitive Plans are competitive with the external market Plans help to attract and retain talent Strategically and culturally aligned Incentive Plans support success, aligned with Shires goals Plan designs support Shire Culture Performance oriented Differentiate based on performance Maintain link to overall Group performance Valued by employees Employee perceived value is aligned with cost to Company Plans drive shareholder value Plans minimize accounting cost and provide tax efficiencies where possible In addition, the Committee reconfirmed the following compensation philosophy: pay should be targeted at the 50th percentile for median level performance.
However, compensation plans should allow for the achievement of top quartile pay levels, if appropriate, to recognize the highest levels of performance: benchmarking should consider each individual component of pay base salary, annual incentive, and long-term incentive targets.
Additionally, market data for total cash and total direct compensation will also be part of the pay decision: percentage of pay at risk should consider the external market.
Further guidelines for Executive Directors and other members of senior leadership include: base pay and incentive targets are determined with reference to a blended US UK market comparison group.
Pay is targeted at or around the median relative to the comparison group and actual amounts may be higher or lower than the median based on performance: the Committee currently aims for variable compensation to represent over two-thirds of total remuneration: and executive Directors and senior leadership are encouraged to own shares in the Company in order to ensure the alignment of their interests with those of the Companys shareholders.
The Remuneration policy, through the Guiding Principles and compensation philosophy, is designed to balance the needs of the Company, the shareholders, and employees.
It recognizes the importance for reward programs to link to Company strategy, with a focus on performance and achieving shareholder value, while also providing programs that are competitive, are valued by employees, and reward them for strong performance in the achievement of Company and individual goals.
The Committee was also mindful of achieving this balance in 2009, in light of the wider economic downturn.
The Committee recognized this external environment in making decisions and was focused on ensuring that salary increases, plan payouts for bonuses and long-term incentives were closely aligned to Company performance and the creation of shareholder value.
14 Shire plc Summary Financial Information 2009 Summary Directors remuneration report Service contracts The Executive Directors service contracts are based on a rolling term.
The contracts contain obligations on the Executive Directors in respect of intellectual property, together with post-termination restrictions.
The Committees view is that the Company should retain the right to make a payment in lieu of notice to a Director.
In the event of early termination, Executive Directors should be treated fairly but paid no more than is necessary.
Moreover, there should be no element of reward for failure.
Mr Russells contract, which is dated July 2, 2008, reflects his promotion to Chief Executive Officer in June, 2008 and incorporates contract provisions reflecting current best practice for Executive Directors contracts.
Effective January 1, 2010, Mr Russells contract was amended to reflect his move to the US, including changes to benefits and pension arrangements noted above.
Otherwise, all terms remained the same except for those required for the contract to be compliant with US law.
Mr Hetheringtons contract is dated July 2, 2008.
Mr Russells and Mr Hetheringtons contracts require them to give Shire 12 months notice.
Shire is required to give Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington 12 months notice of termination, other than if termination is for cause.
The contracts contain phased payment provisions which would entitle Shire to terminate an Executive Directors employment and make a severance payment not as a lump sum but in monthly instalments over the length of the notice period.
These provisions allow the payments to be reduced, or eliminated entirely, by income obtained by the director from a new post.
In the event of termination of employment within 12 months of a change in control, the amount payable to Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington is one years salary and the cash equivalent of one years pension, car allowance and other contractual benefits.
Any annual bonus payable is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at the contractual maximum level.
The amount of annual bonus payable upon termination of employment in any other circumstances, other than for cause, is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at the contractual target level.
