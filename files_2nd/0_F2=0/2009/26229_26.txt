The expected return on in-force is based on the unwind of the risk discount rate on the opening, adjusted base value of in-force VIF.
The opening base VIF of the Risk and Savings business was 4,268m in 2009.
This is adjusted for the effects of opening model changes of 31m to give an adjusted opening base VIF of 4,299m.
This is then multiplied by the opening risk discount rate of 8.3% and the result grossed up at the notional attributed tax rate of 28% to give a return of 496m.

As a result of the 2007 corporate restructure, this release along with current year movements did not give rise to any incremental tax and therefore resulted in a 59m benefit to embedded value.

The 2009 Risk and Savings covered business variation from longer term investment return improved significantly during the second half of 2009 as a result of the investment actions taken within the non profit annuity credit portfolios and the general improvements in all investment markets.
The reported adverse variance of 513 m is primarily due to the 335 m EEV impact of swap transactions undertaken in the first half of 2009 to improve the IFRS matching of annuity business which reduced the assumed future yield on the annuity assets for EEV purposes, 77 m is due to an increased cost of capital arising from fide-risking activity to reduce the equity ratio for assets backing solvency capital and 50 m is the EEV impact of holding additional cash balances, largely to back the short term default provision.
These effects were all reported in the half-year 2009 results.

2009 Risk and Savings economic assumption changes include 125m relating to the decrease in the UK risk discount rate in 2009 from 8.3% to 8.0%, and 250 m as a result of higher assumed future inflation and higher cost of capital on increased annuity reserves.
In addition, increases in the realistic and statutory long term default provisions for the assets backing annuity business had an EEV impact of 124m.
2009 lnternational economic assumption changes primarily reflect the increase in the US risk discount rate in 2009 from 6.8% to 7.4%.
