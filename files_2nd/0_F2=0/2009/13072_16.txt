Foreign currency translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at a forward contract rate.
Taxation The tax charge is based on the profit for the period and takes into account taxation deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided for in full and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Fixed assets Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment.
Employee share schemes Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and restricted share schemes.
Any shortfall between the cost to the employee and the fair market value of the awards at date of grant is charged to the income statement over the period to which the performance criteria relate, with the credit taken directly to the retained earnings reserve.
Additional employer costs in respect of options and awards are charged to the income statement account over the same period with the credit included in equity.
Where awards are contingent upon future events an assessment of the likelihood of these conditions being achieved is made at the end of each reporting period and reflected in the accounting entries made.
Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of the Group, and such share based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the Group, UITF 44 requires the subsidiaries to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20, Share based payments, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Debtors Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Creditors Creditors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Capital transactions When the Company repurchases equity share capital, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge to equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in Treasury in order to satisfy employee options, or cancelled and, in order to maintain capital, an equivalent amount to the nominal value of the shares cancelled is transferred from Retained Earnings to the Capital Redemption Reserve.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and other deposits with a maturity of less than three months when deposited.

8 SHARE BASED REMUNERATION Reckitt Benckiser Group plc has two employees, the Groups CEO and CFO.
Details of their share awards that are not fully vested are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report, and the charge in relation to the year ended 31 December 2009 is set out below.
The Company has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the awards.
The fair value of awards with options outstanding at 31 December 2009 is shown in note 5 c of the Group accounts on pages 38 and 39.
Notes Contractual life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three-year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2009 or 2008 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period, to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
For share options outstanding at 31 December 2009 the range of exercise prices is disclosed in note 5c of the Group accounts.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding options is 6.74 years 2008: 5.76 years.
The weighted average share price for the year was 28.37 2008: 27.15.
