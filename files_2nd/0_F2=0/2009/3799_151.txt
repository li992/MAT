Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2009 22 Provisions continued 2009 2008 Provisions m m Current 123 113 Non-current 342 341 Total provisions 465 454 The provision for insurance relates to the costs of self-funded insurance schemes and is essentially long-term in nature.
Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Surplus provisions of 23 million 2008: 38 million were credited to the discontinued operations section of the income statement in the year.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short-term and long-term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and sundry other claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Environmental provisions are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
The other provisions include provisions for restructuring.
23 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 3% to 35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 27 million 2008: 28 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are three main arrangements: i Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan : ii Compass Pension Scheme the Scheme : and iii Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This is the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme will continue to accrue benefits under those arrangements.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP there has been a new defined contribution section established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP, the Plan or the Scheme will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan and the Scheme are defined benefit arrangements that are closed to new entrants other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into special sections of the Plan, known collectively as the GAD sections, which have been certified by the Government Actuarys Department as broadly comparable to the relevant public sector scheme.
All members accruing pensions under the Plan and Scheme for service accruing after 6 April 2006 other than for the protected members in the GAD sections accrue benefits on an 80th of final pensionable salary basis.
The link between pensionable pay and salary has been removed so that pensionable pay from 6 April 2006 will only increase in line with salary up to a maximum of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index if lower.
98 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2009 Consolidated financial statements 23 Post-employment benefit obligations continued After the year end, on 2 October 2009, the Company entered into consultation with active members of the Plan and Scheme other than those protected members in the GAD sections regarding a proposal to cease future accrual of pensions for those members in respect of service incurred after 31 January 2010.
The Plan and the Scheme are operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan and the Scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations were as at 5 April 2007.
The final results revealed a significant improvement in the funding positions since the previous valuation, even allowing for the updated mortality assumptions.
The next formal valuation is due with effect from 5 April 2010 and it is expected that, despite a cautious investment strategy, the funding position will have worsened.
The Plan and the Scheme are reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requirements.
The Chairman, Tony Allen, is independent.
The other six trustee directors are UK-based employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated although one of these positions is vacant.
The Plan has a corporate trustee.
The Chairman, Peter Morriss, is independent.
There are a further eight trustee directors who are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, four of whom have been member-nominated again one of these positions is vacant.
The Scheme is a closed defined benefit arrangement and also has a corporate trustee.
The Chairman, David Bishop, is independent.
The remaining six trustee directors are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, Compass contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the United States.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 3 million in the year 2008: 3 million to these arrangements.

The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the respective investment portfolio of each plan.

The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period.
The actual return on assets was a gain of 82 million 2008: loss of 95 million.
The cumulative actuarial loss recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense was 347 million 2008: 141 million.
An actuarial loss of 206 million 2008: gain of 15 million was recognised during the year.
Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligations are particularly sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions, including the discount rate and life expectancy.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the UK discount rate would result in a 124 million decrease or 135 million increase in the UK defined benefit obligations, respectively.
An increase or decrease of one year in the life expectancy of all UK members from age 65, would result in a 39 million increase or 38 million decrease in the UK defined benefit obligations, respectively.. 102 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2009 C CG6974 AR p59 p136.
