Share-based payments There are share-based payment arrangements which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares: these awards are granted by AMEC.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
