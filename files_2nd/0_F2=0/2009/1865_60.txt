Where a licence has an indefi nite life, the licence is not amortised until such time as the remaining life of the associated platform is estimated to be 20 years, at which point amortisation commences over the remaining useful life of the licence.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives which is on average 10 years.
The 1.0 million decrease to goodwill on acquisitions in prior years 2008: 0.3 million increase arises as a result of the fi nalisation of fair value exercises.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefi t from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 m m Flight Support ASIG US 91.7 102.5 Signature US 216.5 241.9 Signature UK 16.3 16.3 Other several CGUs 30.3 33.2 Aftermarket Services & Systems Dallas Airmotive 52.0 58.1 H S Aviation 10.7 10.7 Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing 26.0 29.1 Other several CGUs 31.4 35.0 474.9 526.8 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill relating to Executive Beechcraft, which was previously identifi ed as a separate CGU, has now been included within Signature US, since the business has been integrated into Signature US and is therefore part of the same CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that refl ect current market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specifi c to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The key assumptions in constructing the 2010-2012 plans were that: Si gnature and ASIG will see a return to a modest level of growth in 2010 and further improvement thereafter, with the later cycle Engine Repair & Overhaul business not benefi ting from their growth for a further six to nine months: Legacy Support continues to grow supported by new licences and its exposure to the military sector: and A PPH will be relatively stable in 2010 with no further weakening in business and general aviation activity or component MRO work, before a slow and gradual recovery commences during 2011.
The Group prepares cash fl ow forecasts derived from the most recent fi financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash fl ows for the following years based on an estimated growth rate of 5.0% in the initial two years and 3.0% thereafter.
This rate is well below the average longterm growth rate for the relevant markets.
In the case of ASIG US, value in use would be broadly equal to carrying value in the event that the estimated growth rate fell to 2.0%.
With the exception of ASIG US management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes which would result in the carrying amount of the CGUs exceeding the recoverable amounts.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash fl ows for all CGUs is 10.2% and this approximates to the Groups weighted average cost of capital which is deemed applicable for all CGUs.
