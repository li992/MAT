Mined metal production at our Australian mines was broadly in line at 27,000 tonnes in FY 2009.
CMT supplies c. 9% of our total concentrate requirements at the Indian copper smelting operations.
Unit Costs Net cost of 3.1 US cents per lb INR 3,138 per tonne in FY 2009 was higher than 1.8 US cents lb INR 1,563 per tonne in FY 2008, largely due to higher power costs in H1 FY 2009 and a decline in byproduct realisations during H2 FY 2009.
Unit CoP at our Australian operations in FY 2009 was 140 US cents per lb down from 160 US cents per lb in FY 2008, Sulphuric Acid Plant Cooling primarily on account of lower TC-RC paid to the smelter and a reduction in royalty which is LME linked.
Tower Erection TC-RC Realised TC-RCs for FY 2009 were 11.7 US cents per lb, down 25.5% compared Sulphuric Acid Plant cooling tower Based on this idea, three sets of with FY 2008.
We were largely insulated is one of the critical equipments packaged cooling towers were xed from the volatility in the spot market of the plant, primarily used for -.
4100 cum hr for Gas cleaning as a large part of our total concentrate supplying cooling water to Sulphuric plant and 1875 cum hr for Sulphuric requirement was sourced through acid plant for maintaining the acid plant I and also 1850 cum long-term contracts with mines as acid temperatures and also in Gas hr for Sulphuric acid plant II well as through captive supplies from cleaning Plant GCP heat exchangers.
Based on longThe procurement of these cooling term settlements at better terms In November 2008, four decks of towers was done within two weeks.
and current market conditions, we the cooling tower collapsed and Structural foundation and pedestals expect TC-RCs to improve in FY 2010. consequently brought the smelter for these mobile cooling towers to a halt.
The initial time estimates were made prior to the erection Sales to rebuild the cooling tower were activities.
Also structural materials, Sales in the domestic market was 7-8 months.

Also laying piping compared to 15 to 20 weeks required to greater distances was a dif cult in the normal course.

Business Review 16 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Copper continued Unit Costs Unit CoP was 258.3 US cents per lb in FY 2009, up 33% compared with FY 2008.
Costs in H1 FY 2009 were at a historical high on account of higher input costs, higher manpower costs, lower production and a strong Zambian kwacha.
At Konkola, measures including replacement of old compressed air lines and electrical lines have yielded signi cant improvements in mining operations.
Our continued efforts to curtail costs, optimise assets, ramp down high cost operations, renegotiate Zambia all contracts for supplies, commodities The performance of our CopperZambia business in FY 2009 is set out below.

Further, cobalt mining has mines, with current reserves and resources of 470 million tonnes of ore at have been engaged in assessing the root started from the Nchanga Open Pit cause of the problem to provide a robust at Cut II.
We are optimistic about an average grade of 2.5%, equivalent to c. 12 million tonnes of copper content.

In line with our approach to ensure OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 17 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Case study long mine life in our operations, we plan to soon commence extensive exploration work at KCM and expect to add signi cant reserves and resources through brown eld exploration.
Projects The new Nchanga smelter is commissioned and is now ramping up.
We expect the smelter to achieve its rated capacity by Q2 FY 2010.
Abundant availability of copper concentrate within the proximity of our plants provides us with an opportunity to engage in custom smelting to supplement the production from our integrated operations.
Construction activity at the Konkola Deeps mine expansion project is progressing well.
We achieved a major milestone in Q4 FY 2009 by sinking the production shaft to a depth of c. 950 metres, supported by a satisfactory orientation between the two subshafts.
We are on course for mid-shaft Cobalt Alloy Production at commissioning by mid FY 2010 by which additional hoisting capacity of about 3 mtpa of ore will become available KCMBreaking New Grounds with the use of one rock winder in one compartment of the shaft.
Sinking of the Number 4 shaft to its final depth of 1,490 metres will continue As a standard practice, from the Cobalt is recovered in the second through the other compartment.
