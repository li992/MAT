In the first half we saw revenue and pro t growth whereas the second half saw more signi cant local currency revenue and pro t declines.
During the second half operating results also bene ted from 1 the stronger dollar.
As a result, reported Group revenues grew to 1.07bn 2008: 1.05bn, whilst the underlying pre-tax pro t was 87.4m 2008: 112.3m.

The fourth quarter cost reduction was greater, its eet size in the second half of the previous year.
Consequently with pre-depreciation costs down 20% as the additional cost reduction A-Plants full year underlying operating pro t was 16m down from 30m measures took hold.

This re ected the trading results discussed above together with the translation bene t from the stronger dollar which averaged $1.68 in the year to April 2009, 16% stronger than 2007 8s average of $2.01.
Lower average interest rates and signi cantly lower underlying average debt levels resulted in a lower nancing cost despite an adverse translation effect from the stronger dollar in which 99% of our debt is denominated.
1 Following adoption in the year end accounts of the provisions of the 2008 Improvements to IFRSs, underlying revenue now includes as revenue 43.9m of proceeds generated from the sale of used rental equipment whilst underlying costs include as a cost of revenue, the 37.3m net book value of the equipment sold.
This aligns our treatment of used sale proceeds under IFRS with that followed by Sunbelts peers under US GAAP.
Previously under IFRS, Ashtead would have shown the 6.6m net gain as other income.
