Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

82 Dimension Data Annual Report 2009 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2009 continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial RECOGNITION OTHER THAN IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION OF OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN A TRANSACTION THAT AFFECTS NEITHER THE TAX profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the depreciable value of the assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: #AMPUS PROPERTY WNER OCCUPIED PER ANNUM, EASEHOLD LAND BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS VER THE LEASE TERM #OMPUTER AND WORKSHOP EQUIPMENT n PER ANNUMOTOR VEHICLES PER ANNUM Ofce furniture and equipment 10% per annum #ERTAIN COSTS OF PURCHASE DEVELOPMENT AND INSTALLATION OF MAJOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS INCLUDING PACKAGED SOFTWARE ARE CAPITALISED AND AMORTISED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES GENERALLY THREE TO lVE YEARS ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS !SSETS HELD UNDER lNANCE LEASES ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES ON THE SAME BASIS AS OWNED ASSETS OR where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2009 83 The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
Investment property Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation, is measured initially at its cost, including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement for the period in which they arise.

If any such indication exists, the RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF THE ASSET IS ESTIMATED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IF ANY 7HERE the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable AMOUNT OF THE CASH GENERATING UNIT TO WHICH THE ASSET BELONGS !N INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDElNITE USEFUL LIFE IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIREDANAGEMENT S lNANCIAL projections used for purposes of impairment testing do not exceed five years.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated FUTURE CASH mOWS ARE DISCOUNTED TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A PRE TAX DISCOUNT RATE THAT REmECTS CURRENT MARKET assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.

Financial instruments Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD !PPROPRIATE ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED IRRECOVERABLE AMOUNTS ARE RECOGNISED IN the income statement when there is evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
!T SUBSEQUENT REPORTING DATES DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE 'ROUP HAS THE EXPRESSED INTENTION AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY HELD TO MATURITY DEBT SECURITIES ARE MEASURED AT AMORTISED COST USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD LESS ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS RECOGNISED TO REmECT IRRECOVERABLE AMOUNTS !N IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNISED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, and is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2009 85 Impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the investments recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
NVESTMENTS OTHER THAN HELD TO MATURITY DEBT SECURITIES ARE CLASSIlED AS EITHER INVESTMENTS HELD FOR TRADING OR AS available for sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
For available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for equity investments classied as available for sale are not subsequently reversed through the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for debt instruments classied as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
Such techniques include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ows analysis or other valuation models.

The total cost of the acquisition was $282.1 million, and was nanced by cash, part of which was raised by an equity issuance.

In addition, cost reductions and improved efficiencies will be gained through the acquisition.
Following the acquisition of the minorities, a share ownership scheme was established covering 4.75% of the entity over a period of four years.
This is considered to be an equity settled scheme and accordingly the share based expense at grant date amounted to $1.8 million.
The acquisition of these shares has been funded by the Group.
The appreciation in this equity interest will be determined by a valuation, which will be reduced by the outstanding nancing.
In arriving at the value of the award, the Black Scholes optic model was applied using the following inputs: risk free interest rate 3.9% expected volatility 30% dividend yield of 4.9% Transaction costs capitalised to the cost of the investment were $4.2 million.
Other immaterial changes in holdings in subsidiaries during the year amounted to a net payment of $2.1 million.
"Acquisitions $URING THE PERIOD THE 'ROUP MADE TWO SMALL ACQUISITIONS OF SUBSIDIARIES 4EKSYS AND ""LUElRE FOR AN aggregate consideration of $4.3 million, and $5.1 million for the assumption of a shareholders loan."
This resulted in $7.6 million being recognised as goodwill on acquisition.
The net assets and liabilities for these acquisitions amounted to $1.2 million and $0.6 million respectively.
Teksys and Bluere were acquired effective January 2009 and October 2008 respectively.
Since the date of acquisition, Teksys and Bluere have contributed revenue of $22.5 million and $6.8 million and loss for the period of $0.5 million and profit of $0.5 million, respectively.
Had these acquisitions taken place at 1 October 2008, additional revenue of $27.8 million and profit for the period of $0.8 million would have been recognised.

With regard to trade receivables and finance lease receivables, Group policy is only to deal with counterparties with an appropriate credit rating.
Furthermore, credit risk relating to trade receivables is considered lower than average due to the nature of our clients, mostly being large blue chip corporates and government organisations.

Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash ows of the investment have been impacted.
