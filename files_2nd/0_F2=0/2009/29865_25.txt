The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Trusts AIC in January 2009, is inconsistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The Directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Given that the Directors anticipate a successful outcome in the upcoming continuation vote they believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Companys accounts.
All financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised or fide-recognised on the date of the transaction by the use of trade date accounting.
As the Company is a UK investment trust, whose share capital is issued in the UK and denominated in sterling, the Directors consider that the functional currency of the Company is sterling.
b Presentation of income statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented within the income statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as an investment trust, net capital profits may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. c Revenue Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no exdividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the income section of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value 46 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital section of the Income Statement.

Details of transaction costs on purchases and sales of investments are disclosed in note 6 on page 52. ii expenses are treated as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
e Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all taxable temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates applicable to the legal jurisdictions in which they arise.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
f Investments held at fair value through profit or loss The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition all of the Companys non-current asset investments are designated on initial recognition as being at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost including expenses incidental to the acquisition.
Subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is based on their quoted bid price at US market close on the balance sheet date, without deduction for any of the estimated future selling costs.
However, in TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 47 ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES CONTINUED circumstances where appropriate, the value of the close of market bid prices are adjusted to a fair value basis having regard to a range of market triggers and proxies.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement.
g Foreign currencies Transactions involving foreign currencies are translated to Sterling the Companys functional currency at the spot exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency gains and losses are included in the Income Statement and allocated as capital or income depending on the nature of the transaction giving rise to the gain or loss.
Foreign currency gains and losses allocated as capital are included in the transfer to Capital Reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
i Reserves Share Premium Account represents the amount paid on the Share Capital in excess of the shares nominal value.
Capital Redemption Reserve represents the nominal value of shares repurchased.
Capital reserves the Companys Articles of Association preclude it from making any distribution of capital profits.
Capital Reserve previously Capital Reserve Realised and Capital Reserve Unrealised gains and losses on realisation of investments, realised exchange differences of a capital nature, without accepting adverse terms, and the amounts by which other assets and liabilities valued at fair value differ from their book value are dealt with in this reserve.
Purchases of the Companys own shares for cancellation are also funded from this reserve.
