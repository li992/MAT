The plan, which is funded and HM Revenue & Customs registered, covers approximately 460 2008 460 employees, of which 150 2008 170 are in the defined benefit section which provides pensions based on final salaries and 310 2008 290 are in the defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime allowance.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are now closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the defined benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US and other benefits Total 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 7 9 1 1 8 10 Interest cost on benefit obligation 22 30 10 10 1 1 33 41 Expected return on plan assets 21 32 8 11 29 43 Operating profit before exceptional items 8 7 3 1 1 12 8 Exceptional items 11 11 19 7 3 1 1 23 8 On 23 January 2009, approval was given for the payment of enhanced pension transfers to those deferred members of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan who had accepted an offer to receive the enhancement either as a cash lump sum or as an additional transfer value to an alternative pension provider.
The payments, comprising lump sum amounts of 5.9m and additional contributions of 4.3m, were made by the Group in the first quarter of 2009.
The transfer values subsequently paid by the plan were 45m and the corresponding IAS 19 liability extinguished was 38m.
The settlement loss arising of 7m being the $11m exceptional items above, together with the lump sum payment and costs of arrangement, has been charged to the Group income statement as an exceptional item see note 5.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements 95 25 Retirement benefits continued Assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the benefit obligation are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US benefits 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % % % % % Wages and salaries increases 5.1 4.5 4.0 4.0 Pensions increases 3.6 3.0 Discount rate 5.7 5.6 5.7 6.2 5.7 6.2 Inflation rate 3.6 3.0 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 9.0 9.5 Ultimate rate that the cost trend rate trends to 5.0 5.0 Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
In respect of the UK plans, the specific mortality rates used are in line with the PA92 medium cohort tables, with age rated down by one year, implying the following life expectancies at retirement.
In the US, life expectancy is determined by reference to the RP-2000 healthy tables.
Pension plans UK US 2009 2008 2009 2008 Years Years Years Years a Current pensioners at 65 male 23 23 18 18 female 26 26 21 20 b Future pensioners at 65 male 24 24 18 18 female 27 27 21 20 a Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the end of the reporting period.
b Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years relating to an employee retiring in 2029.
The assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the statement of financial position.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.
UK US Increase Increase Higher lower decrease Higher lower decrease pension cost in liabilities pension cost in liabilities $m $m $m $m Discount rate 0.25% decrease 0.6 23.3 5.2 0.25% increase 0.5 22.2 5.0 Inflation rate 0.25% increase 1.6 20.7 0.25% decrease 1.3 19.8 Mortality rate one year increase 0.8 9.2 6.6 In 2018, the healthcare cost trend rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate.
A one percentage point increase decrease in assumed healthcare costs trend rate would increase decrease the accumulated post-employment benefit obligations as of 31 December 2009 by approximately $1.6m 2008 $1.7m and would increase decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net postemployment healthcare cost for the period then ended by approximately $0.1m 2008 $0.1m.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2006 and showed a deficit of 81m on a funding basis.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the trustees at that time, the Group aims to eliminate this deficit by March 2014 through additional Company contributions and projected investment returns.
Of the agreed contributions of 40m, three payments of 10m were made in prior years and the final commitment of 10m was met through the funding of the enhanced pension transfer arrangements detailed above.
The next actuarial valuation due as at 31 March 2009 is currently in progress.
Company contributions are expected to be $13m in 2010.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of $298m and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.
