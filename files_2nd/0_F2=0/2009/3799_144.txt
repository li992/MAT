Trade receivables The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been satisfactorily completed.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered including how overdue the debt is, the type of debtor and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
