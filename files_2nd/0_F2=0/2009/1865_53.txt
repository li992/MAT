Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Segmental information Adoption of IFRS 8, Operating Segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with eff ect from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identifi ed on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Following the adoption of IFRS 8, there has been no change to the Groups reportable segments as previously reported, and no requirement to restate the opening balance sheet position.
The Group provides information to the Chief Executive on the basis of components that are substantially similar within the segments in the following aspects: the nature of the long-term fi financial performance the nature of the products and services the nature of the production processes the type of class of customer for the products and services the nature of the regulatory environment Based on the above, the primary reportable segments of the Group have been deemed to be Flight Support, which comprises Signature Flight Support and ASIG, and Aftermarket Services and Systems, which comprises Engine Repair and Overhaul, Legacy and APPH.
The components of these two segments are substantially similar in the aspects above and are therefore deemed to be the primary segments of the Group.
The businesses within the Flight Support segment provide re-fuelling, ground handling and other services to the business, general and commercial aviation markets.
The businesses within the Aftermarket Services and Systems segment maintain, manufacture and support engines and aerospace components, sub-systems and systems.
Sales between segments are immaterial.
