23 VAT on management fees In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should be charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgment on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then, HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies.
The Manager submitted reclaims to HMRC for the amount of VAT charged to the Company in respect of investment management services from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2007.
In the accounts for the year to 30 June 2008 an amount of 1,641,000 was recognised in respect of the anticipated reclaim for the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007.
The Company received 1,876,000 in February 2009 in settlement of the reclaim for the 2000-2007 period, so a further 235,000 has therefore been recognised in these financial statements in respect of that reclaim.
This write back has been allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
During the year under review, the Company also received 317,000 of interest payment in respect of the 2000 2007 reclaim.
This is included in Other interest receivable and similar income in the Income Statement.
Since year end, the Company has received 713,000 in respect of VAT charged on investment management fees during the period from 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996.
This write back has also been allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
In addition, an amount of 511,000 in respect of interest on this reclaim, has been received and recognised in the Income Statement.
The possibility of recovering any VAT paid on management fees during the period from 5 December 1996 to 30 September 2000 is remote and consequently there is no recognition of VAT reclaims for that period in these financial statements.
VAT has not been applied to investment management fees invoiced since June 2007.
