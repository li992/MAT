80 Annual Report and Accounts January 2009 Accounts Notes to the accounts 26 Retirement benefit obligations During the year the company operated four pension plans, the two main schemes being A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
The company also operated two Group Personal Pension schemes for a limited number of employees.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the company and are invested in managed funds.
Full valuations of these plans were conducted as at 1st November, 2005 using the attained age method.
The latest valuation at 1st April, 2008 is being finalised after the year end date.
The total assets of the plans at valuation were 43,300,000.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the rate of return on investments and to the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 2.2% per annum higher than the growth in pensionable pay.
In the period after retirement it was assumed that the investment return would be 0.4% per annum lower than the increase in pensions accruing up to November 2005 and 1.85% per annum higher for pensions accruing thereafter in both the executive and staff plans.
The deficit as at 1st November, 2005 determined using the above assumptions, was 20,400,000.
The valuation used for the defined benefit plan has been based on market conditions as at the company year end.
The full actuarial valuation carried out at 1st November, 2005 was updated to 31st January, 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
Defined benefit plan The group operates a defined benefit plan for qualifying employees.
Under the plan, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation and reduced to reflect estimated investment management expenses, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of an assumption of 6.25% for the year ending 30th January, 2010 6.7% for the year ending 31st January, 2009.

The movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: 2009 2008 Average Average exercise exercise price in pence price in pence Options per share Options per share At start of the year 343,148 872p 591,220 489p Granted p 168,814 975p Forfeited 25,492 818p 22,579 764p Exercised 10,775 655p 394,307 348p At end of the year 306,881 876p 343,148 872p None of the options listed above were exercisable at the respective year end dates.

LTIP During the year an award of shares was made to the executive directors as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The weighted average fair value of the share awards made during the period was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
The significant inputs to the model were as follows: 18th March, 22nd October, 28th October, Date of grant 2008 2008 2008 Number of instruments granted 30,900 17,500 20,394 Share price at date of grant 1,150p 1,119p 1,123p Contractual life in years 3 2 3 Dividend yield 3.25% 3.25% 3.25% Expected outcome of meeting performance criteria at grant date 27.5% 27.5% 27.5% Fair value determined at grant date 1,043p 1,046p 1,038p AESOP As described in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 45 there are two elements to the AESOP.
The partnership share element provides that for every three shares that a participant purchases in A. G. BARR p. l. c. up to a maximum contribution of 125 per month, the company will purchase one matching share.
The matching shares purchased are held in trust in the name of the individual.
There are various rules as to the period of time that the shares must be held in trust but after five years the shares can be released tax free to the participant.
The second element of free shares allows participants to receive shares to the value of a common percentage of their earnings, related to the performance of the group.
The maximum value of the annual award is 3,000 and the shares awarded are held in trust for five years.
