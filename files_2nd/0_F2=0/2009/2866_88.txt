Accounts The Capita Group Plc 111 24 Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts The Group uses finance leases and hire purchase contracts to acquire plant and machinery.
These leases have terms of renewal and purchase options but no escalation clauses.
Renewals are at the option of the lessee.
The value of future minimum lease payments and their present value, which are the same, is analysed as follows: 2009 2008 m m Not later than 1 year 0.1 Later than 1 year but not more than 5 years 1.3 1.4 Operating lease agreements where the Group is lessee The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, motor vehicles and items of plant and machinery.
These leases have an average duration of between 3 and 10 years.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Not later than 1 year 59.3 59.2 Later than 1 year but not later than 5 years 128.5 158.0 Later than 5 years 53.9 23.0 241.7 240.2 25 Provisions Insurance Property Arch cru Other Total provision provision m m m m m At 1 January 2009 3.3 3.3 Transfer from accruals in the year 3.0 3.0 Transfer from other payables in the year 14.2 14.2 Utilisation 0.6 0.6 Additional provisions in the year 0.8 2.4 20.0 2.6 25.8 Provisions acquired 2.2 2.2 Unwinding of interest on discounted provisions 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2009 15.0 7.4 20.0 5.6 48.0 Certain liabilities previously held within accruals and other payables have been reclassified as provisions as it is considered that the classification is more appropriate given the nature of the balances.
The property provision is made on a discounted basis for the future rent expense and related cost of leasehold property net of estimated sub-lease income where the space is vacant or currently not planned to be used for ongoing operations.
The expectation is that this expenditure will be incurred over the remaining periods of the leases which range from 1 to 6 years.
Arch cru Funds dealings in 2 open ended investment companies OEICs, for which Capita Financial Managers CFM is the authorised corporate director ACD and Arch Financial Products LLP was the delegated investment manager, were suspended on 13 March 2009, as a result of illiquidity in the underlying investments of the OEICs and an anticipated inability to meet future redemptions.
This was exacerbated by unprecedented market turmoil post the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Since the suspension, CFM, has been working with specialist advisers to conduct a detailed review of the underlying assets of the OEICs and options for their future.
This review was completed in December 2009.
The underlying assets of the OEICs have fallen in value and remain illiquid.
CFM has advised investors that the only feasible option in the best interests of investors as a whole is for the OEICs to be wound up, with the underlying assets being realised in an orderly manner over a period of time, and the proceeds being returned to investors in the OEICs.
In addition, CFM has informed investors in the OEICs that it is undertaking a review to determine whether such investors have suffered any detriment and, if so, to what extent any of the parties involved should be responsible for compensating them.
This is a complex exercise and it is taking longer than anticipated, but we are determined to ensure that the matter is concluded in a way that takes appropriate account of the results of the review and the interests of investors in the OEICs, but also recognises the interests of Capitas shareholders.
The detailed work undertaken since March 2009 has resulted in significant costs.
We have provided estimated costs of 20m in respect of resolving this matter.
This figure has been disclosed separately from the Group's underlying profit in our accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
It is expected that an outcome will be reached in 2010.
Insurance provisions relate to provisions held by the Groups captive insurer.
Such provisions are held until utilised or such time as further claims are considered unlikely under the respective insurance policies.
26 Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments are comprised of cash, bank loans, bond issues, loan notes, finance leases and derivatives.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions.
These are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, callable interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Their purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

To remove the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations it has entered into currency swaps which effectively hedge the movement in the bonds fair value due to changes in prevailing foreign exchange and interest rates.
The interest rate swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of GBP denominated bonds.
The fair value of the currency and interest swaps are disclosed in note 17 Financial assets and in note 23 Financial liabilities in the current year.

The valuation models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and volatility surfaces.
Unlisted equity securities and investment loans are held at amortised cost.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with multiple counterparties, all of which are financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Accounts The Capita Group Plc 113 26 Financial instruments continued As at 31 December 2009, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: Level 2 m At 31 December 2009 Assets measured at fair value Cash flow hedges 10.8 Interest rate swaps in relation to GBP denominated bonds 3.3 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 136.6 Liabilities measured at fair value Bonds 720.5 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.6 Callable swaps 30.9 During the year the Group only had Level 2 assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
During the year ended 31 December 2009, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the Groups long term debt.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group has primarily issued fixed rate coupon US$ denominated bonds, which have been swapped to floating rate GBP liabilities at the date of issuance using currency swaps.
These currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges against changes in fair value of the bonds due to changes in prevailing foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
In February 2008, Capita executed a series of callable interest rate swaps to convert from paying floating rate GBP interest to fixed rate GBP interest on certain of its swapped bonds.
The counterparty holds the option to cancel these swaps on each semi-annual coupon payment date.
These callable interest rate swaps are not designated in any hedge relationship so their change in fair value is recognised in net finance costs in the income statement see note 10 Net finance cost.
Following the fall in interest rates at the end of 2008 and an increase in the implied volatilities, these callable swaps show a negative mark to market value of 30.9m at 31 December 2009 2008: negative mark to market value of 32m.
This movement results in a noncash accounting profit in the year of 1.1m 2008: loss of 32m.
The callable swap will reverse through the income statement as the mark to market valuation will tend towards zero as the swaps approach maturity or cancellation.
In addition to the fixed rate bonds of 380m issued as at 31 December 2009 underlying value not adjusted for the impact of the swaps, the Group had a further 200.2m of swapped bonds, and a 245m revolving credit facility, both paying floating rate interest.
On 15 July 2009 the Group took 200m of bank term debt maturing on the second anniversary of the issue date paying a floating rate of interest.
This gives the Group as a whole a balanced interest rate risk profile through the use of both fixed and floating rate financial instruments.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December is as follows: Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total At 31 December 2009 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Loan notes 2.6 2.6 Bonds 24.1 98.1 13.9 328.4 464.5 Obligations under finance leases 0.1 1.3 1.4 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.6 10.1 3.5 71.4 84.4 Callable swaps 1.6 6.4 0.8 22.1 30.9 Floating rate Cash in hand 181.5 181.5 Term debt 198.0 198.0 Investment loan 36.7 36.7 Assets available for sale 0.4 0.3 0.7 Bonds 256.0 256.0 Asset-based securitised financing 17.1 17.1 Cash flow hedges 2.0 2.4 1.4 1.4 0.6 3.0 10.8 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 3.3 3.3 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 51.6 51.6 114 The Capita Group Plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued Within Between Between Between Between More than 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years 1 year 12 years Total m m m m m m m At 31 December 2008 Fixed rate Loan notes 3.7 3.7 Bonds 101.327.2105.0 408.9642.4 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 0.7 0.7 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.4 2.6 16.9 142.5 162.4 Callable swaps 1.1 1.5 5.9 23.5 32.0 Floating rate Cash in hand 86.7 86.7 Investment loan 35.3 35.3 Assets available for sale 0.3 0.3 At fair value through income statement 1.6 1.6 Bonds 310.7 310.7 Asset-based securitised financing 10.4 10.4 Cash flow hedges 4.1 1.6 3.5 2.3 2.7 11.5 25.7 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 4.0 4.0 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 107.2 107.2 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

The Group is not generally exposed to significant foreign currency risk except in respect of its cash flows in overseas operations in India which generate exposure to movements in the INR GBP exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this exposure by entering forward currency contracts in the form of Non-deliverable Forward Contracts NDFs to fix the GBP cost of highly probable forecast transactions denominated in INR.
It is the Groups policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the underlying cash flows in order to maximise hedge effectiveness.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had cash flow hedges in place against forecast monthly INR costs in 2010 and each year up to and including 2019.
These forecast INR costs have been determined on the basis of the underlying cash flows, associated with the delivery of services under signed contracts which run to 2019.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the INR GBP exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts.

The Group had an interest rate swap in place with a notional amount of 32.0m 2008: 87.0m whereby it receives a fixed rate of interest of 7.19% 2008: weighted average fixed rate of interest 6.71% and pays a variable rate based on 6 month LIBOR.
The swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 32.0m 2008: 87.0m of the Groups 7.19% 2008: weighted average fixed rate of interest 6.71% bonds.
The Group had in place currency swaps whereby it receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate based on 6 month LIBOR.
The currency swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 472.8m 2008: 518.2m of the Groups bonds, which have coupon rates ranging from 5.57% to 6.51%.
The currency swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its US dollar issued bonds.
The bonds, currency and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms including the amount and the date of maturity see note 23.
Accounts The Capita Group Plc 115 26 Financial instruments continued The mark to market movement on currency swaps represents the extent to which the fair value of these instruments has been affected by the perceived change in the creditworthiness of the counterparties to those instruments.
The Group is comfortable that the risk attached to those counterparties is not significant and believes that the currency swaps continue to act as an effective hedge against the movements in the fair value of the Groups issued US$ denominated bonds.
The Group may, at its option, upon notice of not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days, repay at any time all or part of the notes at no more than the present value of future payments.
Cash flow hedges As noted above, the Group holds a series of forward exchange currency contracts in the form of NDFs designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions in INR of the Groups Indian operations.
2009 2008 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Forward exchange contracts m m m m Fair value 10.8 25.7 The terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
The cash flow hedges are in respect of highly probable forecast monthly costs, based on long term contracts that the Group has in place, denominated in INR up to 2019.
These were assessed to be highly effective as at 31 December 2009 and a net unrealised gain of 10.8m 2008: 25.7m less deferred tax of 3.0m 2008: 7.2m was recognised in equity.
The net loss recognised on cash flow hedges during the year was 10.8m 2008: net gain 20.9m whilst net gains of 4.1m 2008: 0.8m were reclassified to the income statement and included in administrative expenses.
The tax effect of the net movement in cash flow hedges during the year was a credit of 4.2m 2008: charge of 5.6m.
Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that all clients who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, such as cash and cash equivalents, available for sale financial investments, investment loan, financial assets at fair value through the income statement, investment in a joint venture and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages its operations to avoid any excessive concentration of counterparty risk and the Group takes all reasonable steps to seek assurance from the counterparties to ensure that they can fulfil their obligations.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
The Group has netting arrangements in respect of its transactional banking facilities resulting in the legal right of set-off for its overdraft and cash balances.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold cash and undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium term capital and funding obligations, including organic growth and acquisition activities, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and undrawn committed facilities to enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a daily cash management process.
This process considers the maturity of both the Groups financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of multiple sources of funding including bonds, bank loans, loan notes, overdrafts and finance leases over a broad spread of maturities to 2018.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2009 based on contractual payments.
