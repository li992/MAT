Land Securities Group PLC elected for group Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status with effect from 1 January 2007.
As a result the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the pro ts and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying pro ts and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
The calculation of the Groups tax expense and liability necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be nally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
If all such issues are resolved in the Groups favour, provisions established in previous periods of up to 211.0m 2008: 216.0m could be released in the future.

Loss earnings per share continued Management has chosen to disclose adjusted earnings per share from continuing activities in order to provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Accordingly, it excludes the effect of all exceptional items, debt and other restructuring charges, and other items of a capital nature other than trading properties and long-term contract pro ts as indicated above.
An EPRA measure has been included to assist comparison between European property companies.
We believe our measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.

In compliance with IFRS5, the 2008 Group comparatives have been restated to remove the elements arising from the Trillium discontinued operations from continuing activities.
The impairment in relation to the development land and infrastructure programmes within trading properties has been removed from both our and the EPRA adjusted earnings due to the long-term nature of these programmes.
The adjustment to net liabilities on joint ventures is the result of valuation fide cits and as such restricts the recognition of the full valuation fide cit.
Hence, this adjustment is required to re ect that the valuation fide cit has not been fully recognised in the Groups income statement.

The impairment charge in the year is included within the post-tax loss of Trillium within discontinued operations as the goodwill relates to the Trillium operations that were disposed of on 12 January 2009.
As a result of adverse economic conditions impacting Trilliums new business prospects, particularly the reduced availability of long-term debt funding at a reasonable cost, an impairment review was undertaken in compliance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets to assess whether the goodwill carried in the Groups balance sheet was impaired.
As a result of this review, an impairment loss of 148.6m was recognised in the first half of the year.
This impairment is included within discontinued operations note 42.
The carrying value was tested by comparing the carrying amount of the business assets and liabilities with their recoverable amount.
The latter was calculated by reference to the cash ow projections for the entire term of each of Trilliums contracts.
The cash ow projections had been prepared on the basis of strategic plans, knowledge of the market and managements views on achievable new business gains over the longer term.
The main assumptions underlying the forecasts were the relative in ation rates applying to costs and revenues, the amount of expenditure required to ful l the service level commitments, the vacation rate under the DWP contract and the value of new business from Property Partnerships and PPP.
The cash ows were discounted using Trilliums weighted average cost of capital of 9.0% 31 March 2008: 7.5%.

The requirement to hold restricted cash is an operating requirement under the terms of the Security Groups debt programme, which encourages a reduction in gearing when either LTV or interest cover exceeds prescribed levels.
This does not prevent the Group from optimising returns by putting this money on short-term deposit.

A provision was established where the Group anticipated incurring future expenditure at the end of the lease.
The amounts provided were based on the current estimate of the future costs determined on the basis of the present condition of the relevant properties.
Settlement of the amounts provided occurred once agreement was reached with the parties to the lease.
Onerous leases An onerous lease provision related to leasehold properties held within the Trillium operations that were disposed of on 12 January 2009.
A provision was established in respect of leasehold properties that were unoccupied or where the expected future rental income was not expected to meet the Groups rental obligations.
The provisions were based on assumptions about expected future rentals and voids.
Other Other provisions included liabilities that arose from the contractual arrangements with clients of the disposed Trillium operations that included speci c performance measurement targets and life cycle capital expenditure requirements.
Settlement of the amounts provided followed agreement with the clients.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classi ed as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Interest-rate swaps The Group uses interest-rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest-rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash ows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
The change in fair value of the contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments is taken to the income statement.
For contracts that are designated as cash ow hedges the change in the fair value of the contracts is recognised directly in equity.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recognised from the designated cash ow hedges.
The deferred asset or liability assumed is released to the income statement during the term of each relevant swap.
Forward foreign-exchange contracts The Group uses forward foreign-exchange contracts to manage its exposure to exchange-rate movements in relation to debt raised in currencies other than sterling, or to lock in the sterling equivalent of future committed expenditure denominated in foreign currencies.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
The change in fair value of designated cash ow hedging instruments is recognised directly in equity.
The asset acquired or liability assumed is released to the income statement in the period to which it relates.

Debt investors bene t from security over a pool of investment properties valued at 7.5bn at 31 March 2009 2008: 11.0bn.
The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial exibility when the loan to value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage the reduction in gearing see note 31.
The interest rate is xed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date for each MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years is LIBOR plus a step-up margin.
The effective interest rate includes the amortisation of issue costs.
The MTN are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.
Syndicated bank debt At 31 March 2009 the Group had two syndicated bank facilities: 1.
1.5bn authorised credit facility with a maturity of August 2013, which has been fully drawn.
This facility is committed and is secured on the assets of the Security Group.
The interest rates are oating at LIBOR plus a margin of between 0.15% and 0.25%: and 2.
352.0m committed development facility with a maturity of May 2013.
This facility was taken out to fund the development of Leeds Trinity Quarter and is secured on this property: this facility is currently 162.8m drawn.
The interest rates are oating at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.35%.
There are 5.0m of issue costs which are being written off over the life of this facility.

Borrowings continued Bilateral facilities Committed Bilateral facilities totalling 940.0m are available to the Group and are secured on the assets of the Security Group.
These facilities mature between July and December 2011, with the exception of one undrawn facility for 40m which matures in September 2009.
The Group has the option to extend any drawings for a further year past maturity, or two years in the case of the 40m facility.
The interest rates are oating at LIBOR plus a margin of between 0.25% and 0.75%.
Bond exchange fide-recognition On 3 November 2004, a debt re nancing was completed resulting in the Group exchanging all of its outstanding bond and debenture debt for new MTN with higher nominal values.
The new MTN did not meet the IAS39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTN.
The amortisation is charged to net interest expenses in the income statement.
Fair values The fair values of any oating rate financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value.

Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Financial review on pages 18 to 23 and Our risks and how we manage them on pages 30 to 32.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on speci c financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest-rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance, which includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 30 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in note 37.
Capital is managed so as to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders.
The Groups objective is to navigate a prudent course through the current downturn and market volatility.
Whilst the Group is maintaining a strong focus on the business actions which are within its in uence, a number of factors affecting the market in which the Group operates are beyond the Groups control.
The pace of valuation decline has, in recent months, exceeded the pace at which assets can be sold to counteract the impact of falling values on the Groups balance sheet position, and this represents an ongoing risk.
Given the prevailing market conditions and the Groups nancing arrangements, the Group undertook a Rights Issue in March 2009 to improve the Groups ability to preserve and create shareholder value through the downturn and into the next cycle by strengthening the Groups balance sheet and providing exibility to react quickly to pricing and timing opportunities.
The additional capital raised by the Rights Issue reduces the impact of the risk of prolonged falls in property values.
Furthermore, the Group is now in a position to respond quickly to the turning point in the cycle, particularly in relation to the acquisition of assets and the commencement of development opportunities, and that exibility on timing is key to the creation of value.
The Rights Issue also strengthens the Groups position in re nancing its debt facilities.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio gearing to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The following table details the Groups adjusted gearing, which includes the effects of our share of our joint ventures net debt.

Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, amounts due from joint ventures and loans to third parties.
Bank and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, only independently-rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
In light of market conditions, Group Treasury currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all its financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, Group Treasury ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and owing to the long-term nature and diversity of its tenancy arrangements, with central Government being the single largest tenant, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Property sales Property sales receivables primarily relate to the sale of five properties, for which all payments to date have been received when due.
The credit risk on outstanding amounts is considered low.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a signi cant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
Loans to third parties A loan maturing in 2035 was made to Semperian PPP formerly Trillium Investment Partners LP as part of the disposal of the Trillium business.
This loan is not considered a signi cant credit risk as it is repayable from dividends from investments in government infrastructure projects.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of Notes with final maturities between 2013 and 2036, and long-term and short-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has suf cient available funds for its operations and its committed capital-expenditure programme.
The Groups core nancing structure is in the Security Group, although the remaining Non-Restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Land Securities Annual Report 2009 114 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 continued 31.
Financial risk management continued Security Group The Groups principal nancing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by Loan-to-value ratio LTV and Interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is exible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0.
As at 31 March 2008, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 50.5%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and bene ted from maximum operational exibility.
In January 2009, the Group borrowed a further 1,130.0m from its existing committed facilities to preserve operational exibility and currently holds the majority of the funds outside the Security Group.
As a result, the Security Group moved into Tier 2 which imposes limited additional restrictions, such as liquidity requirements which require liquidity facilities or cash reserves to be put in place, or debt to be prepaid over an agreed amortisation period.
After 31 March 2009, the Group expects to operate within Initial Tier 3 in the short to medium term, a more restrictive covenant regime which restricts, for example, payments being made from the Security Group to members of the wider Group.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.
Non-Restricted Group The Non-Restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-Restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.
The Groups objective is to navigate a prudent course through the current downturn and market volatility to avoid the Security Group moving into Final Tier 3 80% LTV.
As at 31 March 2009, as a result of the above decision to increase borrowings and fall in property values, the LTV was 76.7%.
However, 1,596m of cash equivalents was held in the Non-Restricted Group and is available to be applied within the business, including being injected into the Security Group to maintain its LTV at less than 80% if further falls in property values are experienced.
The Security Group would thus avoid entering Final Tier 3 and the signi cant additional financial and operational restrictions that would be imposed.
The Groups aim in the medium term is to return to Tier 1 or Tier 2 to allow greater access to the debt markets and avoid the restrictions imposed in Tier 3.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.

Financial risk management continued iii Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, currency uctuations and availability of credit.
Interest rates The Group uses interest-rate swaps and similar instruments to manage its interest-rate exposure.
With property and interest-rate cycles typically of four to seven years duration, the Groups target is to have a minimum of 80% of anticipated debt at xed rates of interest over this timeframe.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Where speci c hedges are used in geared joint ventures to x the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt these qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2009, the Group including joint ventures had 2.7bn 2008: 2.3bn of hedges in place, and its debt was 107% xed 2008: 80%.
Consequently, based on year end balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the net interest payable in the income statement by 3.5m 2008: increased by 12.4m, and if interest rates fall by 1% then the reverse occurs.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange Foreign-exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign-currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, where committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identi ed, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into forward purchases of foreign currency to x the Sterling value.
Therefore the Groups foreign-exchange risk is low.
The Group had no foreign-currency exposure at 31 March 2009 and was fully hedged at 31 March 2008.
Financial maturity analysis The interest rate and currency pro les of the Groups undiscounted borrowings, after taking into account the effect of the foreign-currency swaps and interest-rate swaps, are set out below: 2009 2008 Fixed Floating Fixed Floating rate rate Total rate rate Total Group m m m m m m Sterling 4,662.2 1,308.2 5,970.4 4,402.5 1,552.7 5,955.2 The expected maturity pro les of the Groups borrowings are as follows: 2009 2008 Fixed Floating Fixed Floating rate rate Total rate rate Total Group m m m m m m One year or less, or on demand 1.1 1.1 172.2 633.5 805.7 More than one year but not more than two years 740.2 200.3 940.5 464.4 38.0 502.4 More than two years but not more than five years 947.3 1,107.9 2,055.2 321.9 321.9 More than five years 2,973.6 2,973.6 3,444.0 881.2 4,325.2 4,662.2 1,308.2 5,970.4 4,402.5 1,552.7 5,955.2 The expected maturity pro les of the Groups derivative instruments are as follows: 2009 2008 Interest Foreign Interest Foreign rate currency rate currency swaps swaps Total swaps swaps Total Group m m m m m m One year or less, or on demand 40.0 40.0 178.9 35.5 214.4 More than one year but not more than two years 480.0 480.0 46.7 46.7 More than two years but not more than five years 1,705.0 1,705.0 1,721.9 1,721.9 More than five years 78.2 78.2 2,225.0 2,225.0 2,025.7 35.5 2,061.2 Land Securities Annual Report 2009 116 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 continued 32.

Net pension surplus Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
A further separate similar scheme, previously set up by Trillium, is also in operation for their employees.
Pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes are as follows: 2009 2008 Group m m fide ned contribution schemes 2.3 2.0 fide ned bene t schemes Land Securities Scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a wholly-funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a self-administered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a quali ed independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected-unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected-unit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 1 July 2006 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2009.
As a result of the valuation performed on 1 July 2006, the Trustees and the Group have agreed that the employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary will be paid together with additional employer contributions to address the fide cit at that time.
All death-in-service and bene ts for incapacity arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement bene ts other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
The major assumptions used in the valuation were in nominal terms : 2009 2008 Group % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.40 3.60 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.40 3.60 Discount rate 7.00 6.90 In ation 3.40 3.60 Expected return on plan assets 6.14 6.44 Land Securities Annual Report 2009 Report of the Directors P0180 Financial statements P81130 Investor resource P131144 Financial statements 117 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 continued 33.

Share-based payments The Groups share-based payments are all equity settled and comprise the Savings Related Share Option Schemes Sharesave, various Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, Performance and Deferred Bonus share schemes related to the annual bonus scheme, and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
In accordance with IFRS2 Share-based Payment the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares or options that will eventually vest.

Impact of Rights Issue on share schemes The Rights Issue that completed in March 2009 offered shareholders the right to acquire five shares for every eight shares that they held, for an issue price of 270p.
As the issue price was below the market price of the ordinary shares a bonus share element was inherent in the Rights Issue.
Both the number and exercise price of the share schemes outstanding at the date of the Rights Issue have therefore been adjusted to account for the dilutive impact of the bonus share element.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes Under the 1993 and 2003 Savings Related Share Option Schemes all staff who have been with the Group for a continuous period of not less than six months are eligible to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave scheme operated by Lloyds Banking Group.
On completion of the three, five or seven year contract period, ordinary shares in Land Securities Group PLC may be purchased at a price based upon the current market price at date of invitation less 20% discount.
Options are satis ed by the issue of new shares.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the scheme before the options vest or lapse if options are not exercised within six months of the bonus date.
In certain circumstances leavers may exercise their options early based upon current savings.
Alternatively, they may continue saving to receive the tax-free bonus at the end of the contract or withdraw their cash immediately.
Fair-value calculations, which relate to the 2003 Scheme only, assume a lapse rate, based upon historic values, of approximately 20% for employees leaving the Group before vesting.

The other half of the Performance Shares were subject to the Groups total property return equalling or exceeding the Investment Property Databank IPD All Fund Universe Index over a three year rolling period.
The final grant under the scheme was made in July 2005.

The underlying performance criteria are earnings per share and increase in net asset value over the previous year.
In previous years, Executive Directors have had the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 20% of salary in cash and 20% of salary in shares for meeting rigorous targets and up to a maximum of 40% of salary in cash and 40% of salary in shares for superior results.
Following a review of the reward structure by the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors are in future eligible for awards of up to 100% of salary, 25% of which must be taken in deferred shares.
Other management grades must now take their entire bonus in cash.
Awards under the plan are satis ed by transfers of existing shares held by the ESOP trust.
The shares are deferred for three years and normally forfeited if the executive leaves employment during the period.
Fair value has been adjusted for participants who have left the Group, but no adjustment has been made for future anticipated lapses.
The deferred shares outstanding under the scheme are to be issued at nil consideration subject to vesting conditions being met.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for shares exercised during the year was 1090p 2008: 1741p.

In addition, an award of matching shares can be made, linked to co-investment in shares by participants.
The participants investment can be made through deferral of an annual bonus award and or through optional pledging of shares purchased in the market.
The maximum level of matching is shares with a face value of 50% of salary for Executive Directors and 25% of salary for senior executives.
Performance conditions are similarly structured to those applying to the Performance Share Plan except that the EPS targets are increased and the IPD index measure is more closely targeted to the Groups asset classes.
Awards may be satis ed by the issue of new shares and or transfer of treasury shares and or transfer of shares other than treasury shares.
Fair value calculations include the assumption that LTIP and matching shares will be awarded at 50% of the maximum possible under the scheme and have been adjusted for participants who have left the scheme but no adjustment has been made for future anticipated lapses.

The expected life used in the model has been determined, based upon managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Risk-free rate is the yield, at the date of the grant of an option, on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated exercise of that option.
