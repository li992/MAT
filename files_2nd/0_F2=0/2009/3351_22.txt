Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 1  i Corporateinformation Charter International plc the Company, which is the ultimate parent company of the Charter Group, is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements for the Group were approved by the Board on 23 March 2010. ii Accountingpolicies The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the United Kingdom UK and in compliance with the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
Although Charter International plc is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law, the consolidated financial statements include disclosures sufficient to comply with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Acquisition accounting adjustments have been finalised in relation to the acquisition of Aeolus Industria e Comercio Ltda by Howden on 22 August 2008.
The comparative information for 2008 has been restated in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations.
The impact of this restatement is to increase goodwill and deferred income tax liabilities by 2.6 million.
The impact on the 2008 income statement is not significant.
In addition, income tax receivable of 6.0 million as at 31 December 2008 that was previously netted off within Income tax liabilities has been included as Current income tax receivables and the comparative information for 2008 has been restated accordingly.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the financial statements of Charter International plc are included within the Group Annual Report.
These are presented in sterling as that is the functional currency of that company.
The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements under UK accounting standards.
 Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after certain adjustments to basic earnings per share so as to help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Previously, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, were excluded in calculating adjusted earnings per share.
For 2009, acquisition costs and the noncash net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations have also been excluded in calculating adjusted earnings per share as these amounts do not relate to underlying business performance.
The impact of excluding acquisition costs and the net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from adjusted earnings per share for 2008 is not significant and therefore these amounts have not been restated.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
Should circumstances change, such that different assumptions, estimates and judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this may give rise to material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year particularly in respect of the key estimates, judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts Revenue and profit on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract calculated by reference to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product liability.
At 31 December 2009, amounts receivable payable under construction contracts were 41.9 million 2008: 71.9 million and 45.5 million 2008: 115.7 million respectively.
Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2009 in respect of construction contracts amounted to 32.4 million 2008: 40.2 million.
Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 2009 of 30.5 million 2008: 28.0 million mainly relate to construction contracts.
Employee benefits Provisions for defined benefit postemployment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions and estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life expectancy.
Other key assumptions for defined benefit postemployment obligations are based in part on market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Further information is disclosed in note 20.
At 31 December 2009, the net retirement benefit obligation was 162.2 million 2008: 139.3 million.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1  continued Goodwill impairment testing Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised.
The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cashgenerating units.
These calculations require estimates of cash flows, growth rates and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cashgenerating units.
Further information regarding these assumptions is set out in note 10.
At 31 December 2009, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was 92.7 million 2008: 92.0 million as restated.
Provisions Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement.
These include provisions for legal and environmental claims.
Calculations of these provisions are based on cash flows relating to these costs estimated by management supported by the use of external consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material.
At 31 December 2009, these provisions amounted to 30.6 million 2008: 35.5 million.
Tax estimates The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect.
The determination of appropriate provisions for current and deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Groups ability to utilise tax benefits through future earnings and tax planning.
These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events.
At 31 December 2009, net income tax liabilities provided were 23.4 million 2008: 26.1 million and net deferred income tax assets recognised amounted to 58.8 million 2008: 34.6 million as restated.
 New standards and amendments to standards mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009 adopted by the Group: IAS 1 revised Presentation of financial statements.
The revised standard requires owner changes in equity such as dividends and issue of share capital to be shown in a separate statement.
Other items of income and expenditure are required to be included in a statement of comprehensive income comprising either a single statement or two statements: an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has elected to follow the latter approach and present two statements.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to expenditure on a qualifying asset where expenditure in relation to that asset commenced after 1 January 2009 are included in the cost of that asset.
There has been no impact on the Groups financial statements as a consequence of adopting the revised standard.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting.
It requires a management approach under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
There have been no changes to the reportable segments presented following the adoption of IFRS 8.
IFRS 2 amendment Sharebased payment effective 1 January 2009 deals with vesting conditions and cancellations.
It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a sharebased payment are not vesting conditions.
These features would need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and others providing similar services: they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation thereof subsequent to grant date.
All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
The Group has adopted IFRS 2 amendment from 1 January 2009.
The amendment does not have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments disclosures amendment effective 1 January 2009.
The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy.
The change in accounting policy only results in additional disclosures: there is no other impact.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and that the Group will apply from 1 January 2010: IFRS 3 revised Business combinations.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent consideration measured at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisitionrelated costs are required to be expensed.
The Group will apply IFRS 3 revised prospectively to transactions from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 5 amendment Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of noncash assets to owners.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes noncash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
The Group will apply IFRIC 17 from 1 January 2010.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with noncontrolling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group will apply IAS 27 revised prospectively to transactions with noncontrolling interests from 1 January 2010.
70 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation 1  continued IAS 38 amendment Intangible assets.
The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has a similar useful economic life.
The amendment will not result in a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The Group will apply IAS 38 amendment prospectively to transactions from 1 January 2010.
IAS 1 amendment Presentation of financial statements.
The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or noncurrent.
The Group will apply IAS 1 amendment from 1 January 2010.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers.
This clarifies the accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and equipment, which is provided by the customer, is used to provide an ongoing service.
IFRS 2 amendments Group cashsettled and sharebased payment transactions.
The amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation.
The new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
iii Basisofconsolidation Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
A shareholding of more than onehalf of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired, including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 see ix a Goodwill below.
Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value adjustments related to the shareholdings prior to the increase in shareholding are taken directly to equity.
Associates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups share of its associates and joint ventures postacquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of postacquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates and joint ventures.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place before 1 January 2004, being the date of transition to IFRS.
iv Segmentalreporting Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal purposes by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Revenue by geographic segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located.
Noncurrent assets and capital expenditure by geographic segment are allocated based on where the assets are located.
v Foreigncurrencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter International plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
The results and net assets of all Group companies that have nonsterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows: a assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date: b income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period: and c all resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1  continued On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
vi Financialassets The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition and reevaluates its designation at each reporting date.
Assets are classified as: loans and receivables: heldtomaturity investments: availableforsale financial assets: or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement.
Availableforsale financial assets include nonderivatives not classified in any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
On initial recognition loans and receivables and heldtomaturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Availableforsale financial assets and financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of nonmonetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents.
They are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
vii Financialinstruments Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as hedges in the financing and financial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges.
Derivative financial instruments categorised as hedges are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement generally as part of financing.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement generally as part of financing.
viii Property, plantandequipment The Groups policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004.
These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
Borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment that first commenced after 1 January 2009 are capitalised see xvi Borrowings below.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straightline method spreading the difference between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 3050 years Plant, machinery and equipment 814 years Vehicles 5 years IT equipment 35 years Asset lives and residual values are reassessed at least annually.
72 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation 1  continued An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount see x Impairment of assets below.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
ix Intangibleassets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Groups previous accounting policy together with additional amounts arising since that date, is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates and joint ventures in relation to associates and joint ventures.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years or included as part of the carrying value of associates and joint ventures.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cashgenerating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
b Research and development Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between 3 and 10 years.
c Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 7 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, except for such costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond 1 year which are capitalised and amortised on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 7 years.
d Intangibles arising on acquisitions In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and knowhow.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
x Impairmentofassets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cashgenerating units.
xi Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the firstin firstout FIFO basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
xii Assetsheldforsale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from the date of classification.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1  continued xiii Tradereceivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Amounts due after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified in the balance sheet as noncurrent.
xiv Cash,  For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
xv Tradepayables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
xvi Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the foreign exchange gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to expenditure that first commenced after 1 January 2009 on a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale is included in the cost of that asset.
Capitalisation ceases when the qualifying asset is substantially complete.
Borrowing costs in relation to inventories and construction contracts that are manufactured in large quantities on a repetitive basis are not capitalised.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
xvii Taxation Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred income taxation.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, including actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations see xviii Employee benefits below and sharebased payments see xix Sharebased payments below, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
xviii Employeebenefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar postretirement benefits principally healthcare under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in equity, in the statement of comprehensive income.
Taxation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is included within financing in the income statement.
For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays a fixed contribution into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
74 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation 1  continued For other defined benefit postemployment obligations, principally postemployment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised directly in equity, in the statement of comprehensive income.
xix Sharebasedpayments The Group operates both equitysettled and cashsettled sharebased compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equitysettled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
Taxation attributable to the excess of the fair value over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cashsettled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date, with changes recognised in the income statement.
For cashsettled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
xx Governmentgrants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straightline basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or nonasset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
xxi  Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised.
Incurred but not reported IBNR amounts are included in provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
xxii Sharecapital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Share issue costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid is deducted from Group equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
xxiii Revenuerecognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the year in respect of construction contracts.
Revenue, which is recorded net of valueadded tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intragroup sales, is recognised as follows: a Sales of goods and services The majority of the Groups revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity has fulfilled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration.
In respect of the sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
b Construction contracts Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer.
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable.
Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1  continued xxiv Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
xxv Dividenddistribution Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid.
2 Segmentanalysis The Group is organised into two principal businesses: ESAB welding, cutting and automation and Howden air and gas handling.
For the purposes of IFRS 8 Operating segments, ESAB is split into two segments: i welding: and ii cutting and automation.
Intersegmental revenue is not significant.

9 Earningspershare Basic headline earnings per share is calculated on an average of 166.8 million shares 2008: 166.7 million shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 0.7 million 2008: 0.2 million dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the potentially issuable shares under the Groups longterm incentive plans.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after certain adjustments to basic earnings per share so as to help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Previously, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, were excluded in calculating adjusted earnings per share as set out in the table on the next page.
It should be noted that the term adjusted is not defined under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to, IFRS measures of profit.

The comparative information for 2008 has been restated following the finalisation of acquisition accounting adjustments as explained in note 1.
The impact of this restatement is to increase goodwill on acquisition by 3.0 million and to decrease exchange adjustments by 0.4 million, resulting in an increase of 2.6 million at 31 December 2008.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from valueinuse calculations.
The key assumptions for the valueinuse calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts.
Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
84 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation 10 Intangibleassets continued The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates detailed in the table below.
These do not exceed the average longterm growth rate for the relevant markets.
The pretax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows are detailed in the table below.
Development costs are amortised once the asset is brought into use.
The Group tests development costs for assets not yet brought into use at least annually for impairment.
iv Other intangible assets have finite lives, over which the assets are amortised.
The amortisation periods are set out in the accounting policies on page 73.
Intangibles, other than goodwill which is not amortised, with a carrying value as at 31 December 2009 of 46.4 million 2008: 44.0 million had a remaining amortisation period of up to 10 years as at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.

In view of the trading performance, startup costs and challenging economic environment in China, the Directors have conducted an impairment review in respect of the property, plant and equipment of ESAB China and, as a result, continue to believe that the fair value of these tangible assets is in excess of carrying value.
When determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment, independent third party advice was obtained.
Where no such evidence existed, a valueinuse calculation was performed.
The key assumptions for the valueinuse calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales values and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts from the most recent budgets approved by management for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates.
These rates do not exceed the average longterm growth rate for the relevant markets.
In respect of ESAB China, the forecast cash flows cover a period of ten years being the remaining estimated useful life of the property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2009, have been based on growth rates of 10 per cent 2008: 8 per cent per annum and have been discounted at a rate of 11 per cent 2008: 11 per cent per annum.
iii Assets in the course of construction as at 31 December 2009 were 20.2 million 2008: 30.4 million.

94 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation 20  The major pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and are of the defined benefit type, the assets of which are held in trusteeadministered funds.
The Group also provides postemployment medical benefits in the United States.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States postemployment medical benefits are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2009 2008 UK Overseas UK Overseas % % % % Discount rate 5.70 5.60 6.30 5.60 Inflation rate 3.60 2.80 2.60 2.60 8.00 9.10 Expected return on plan assets equities 7.50 8.80 bonds 4.90 5.30 4.50 5.60 property 7.50 7.00 other 4.25 5.60 3.00 5.15 total 6.20 7.20 5.70 7.00 Future salary increases 4.60 4.00 3.60 3.45 Future pension increases 3.55 2.30 2.80 1.95 Medical costs inflation ultimate rate 5.00 5.00 The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92 or PA00 standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for future mortality improvements and schemespecific factors.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years 2008: 27 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 30 years 2008: 30 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 26 years 2008: 26 years if they are male and for a further 29 years 2008: 29 years if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States.
The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the RP2000 table with allowance for further mortality improvements.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 24 years 2008: 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26 years 2008: 26 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 23 years 2008: 23 years if they are male and for a further 25 years 2008: 25 years if they are female.
Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected longterm results for the various asset classes.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the riskfree rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.
The estimated impact on the liability for defined benefit pensions and postemployment medical benefits as at 31 December 2009 resulting from changes to key assumptions is set out below:  2009 2008 m m Discount rate 0.25 per cent decrease 23 20 Mortality one year increase in life expectancy after retirement 19 17 A 1 per cent increase in the inflation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by 0.1 million 2008: 0.1 million and the liability by 1.9 million 2008: 2.1 million.
A 1 per cent decrease in the inflation assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by 0.1 million 2008: 0.1 million and the liability by 1.8 million 2008: 2.0 million.

21  i  The international profile of Charters operations exposes it to financial risks including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
The Board sets policies to address these risks and there is a specific treasury policy setting out guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments.
Charters central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing requirements of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group.
Regular cash flow forecasts are prepared by subsidiaries and reviewed by management.
In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and balance sheet foreign currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board.
Foreign currency transaction risks are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls defined in the treasury policy.
a Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly from its own cash resources.
It is the Groups objective to minimise the cost of borrowings and maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities.
If considered appropriate, the Group would use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
b Currency risk The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in Europe and America, and recurring exposures to exchange rate fluctuations in respect of foreign currency transactions.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
Subject to Board approval, balance sheet translation exposures may be mitigated through the use of currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives.
In 2008 the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge part or all of the net investment in subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro or the US dollar.
These contracts were closed out during 2009 such that none existed at 31 December 2009.
Foreign currency transaction exposures result from sales or purchases by subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge the net cash flows resulting from these transactions to the extent these are certain or highly probable.
c Financial credit risk The principal credit risks relate to the failure of dealing counterparties for foreign currency transactions and financial institutions with whom surplus funds are deposited in the short term.
Charters central treasury department monitors regularly the credit status of such counterparties and financial institutions, as well as the location of surplus cash worldwide with credit limits being set and subject to regular review.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 21  continued d Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that, together with cash flows generated from operations, there are sufficient funds for current operations and their future requirements.
During the year the Group increased its principal committed facilities by 25 million to 170 million, which have maturity dates in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of the Charter Group means that the covenants attaching to these facilities are not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required.
Charters central treasury department reviews weekly cash balances held worldwide to ensure that optimal use is made of liquid funds within the Group and to avoid unnecessary borrowing.
e Capital management The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
Capital is regarded as consisting of total equity, net cash and retirement benefit obligations.

This requires disclosure of fair value measurements according to their level within the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
At 31 December 2009 only derivative financial assets and liabilities were included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair values were derived from observable market data and are considered to be level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.
iii Marketpricerisk a Interest rate risk On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that a rise fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the Groups cash balances are exposed would increase decrease profit before tax by approximately 0.4 million 2008: 0.6 million.

L. C. and certain of their whollyowned subsidiaries, have been named as defendants the defendants in asbestosrelated actions in the United States.
These lawsuits have alleged that the defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partlyowned subsidiary of Charter Limited.
Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in the defendants favour either at trial or on appeal.
In subsequent years, the defendants have continued to be named in asbestosrelated lawsuits.
The defendants have contested these actions and, in most cases, have obtained dismissals.
The defendants have settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against the defendants in which they have received service of process are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that the defendants and their whollyowned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages which might ensue if liability were imposed on any of the defendants.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charters operating profits in 2009 were negligible.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
ii Welding The ESAB Group Inc. EGI, an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables.
Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various other defendants such as distributors, trade associations and others.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts.
A multidistrict litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and coordinate pretrial proceedings in the federal court cases.
104 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses   Otherinformation 27  continued A summary of recent cases tried to jury verdict in which EGI was a codefendant are set out below: Natureofverdictand Compensatory Punitivedamages Numberofdefendants Posttrialmotionsor  numberofclaimants damagesUS$m US$m sharingaward appealinprogress December 2007 Plaintiff Federal court 1 claimant 20.5 Nil 4 Yes March 2008 Plaintiff Federal court 1 claimant 0.7 1.7 3 Yes March 2008 Defendants State court 4 claimants Nil Nil Yes November 2008 Plaintiff State court 1 claimant 1.9 Nil 2 Yes November 2008 Defendants Federal court 1 claimant Nil Nil No February 2009 Defendants State court 1 claimant Nil Nil Yes August 2009 Defendants State court 1 claimant Nil Nil No October 2009 Plaintiff Federal court 1 claimant 0.8 5.0 4 Yes EGIs share is US$0.75 million EGIs share is US$1.75 million EGI was also a defendant in a number of other state court cases set for trial in 2009.
However, all of those cases were either dismissed or postponed.
With the exception of the punitive damage awards, if upheld on appeal, EGIs share of the adverse verdicts rendered in December 2007, March and November 2008 and October 2009 should be covered in substantial part by insurance.
EGI, together with its codefendants, is appealing all of the plaintiffs verdicts noted above.
There is, however, no guarantee that an appeal of an adverse verdict will be successful.
There are 8 manganese trials scheduled for the balance of 2010, although it is not anticipated that they will all proceed to trial as scheduled.
Additional trials could also be scheduled.
Over the last 18 years, the Welding Industry Defense group, which was established to represent a number of the welding company defendants, including EGI, in this and other litigation, has succeeded in obtaining defence verdicts in the vast majority of cases in which one or more of its members have been named as a defendant.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGIs counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
EGIs defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$18.2 million, which is reflected in EGIs balance sheet at 31 December 2009.
In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charters financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestosinduced personal injuries.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products.
EGI has no asbestos cases listed for trial in 2010.
EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGIs insurers.
iii Airandgashandling Howden Buffalo Inc. an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it.
Over the past few years, Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 11,116 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 406 cases.
These cases were typically settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial.
Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought.
At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 27  continued However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestosrelated lawsuits against Howden Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
The Company announced on 19 February 2010 that it had launched an investigation into possible irregular payments that may have been made in connection with an attempt to obtain business by an overseas Howden subsidiary in an emerging market: this investigation has been concluded.
Some evidence came to light which, whilst not conclusive, indicated that some inappropriate payments may have been made by two overseas third party agents of two Howden subsidiaries to obtain business in an emerging market.
Appropriate steps have been taken to notify the relevant authorities.
At this time, the Company cannot determine whether any action will be taken by the relevant authorities.
The timing or the outcome of any such action is uncertain.
Accordingly no provision has been made for liabilities in these accounts in respect of the potential consequences of such action being taken.
On the basis of external legal advice, the Directors do not believe the possible consequences are likely to have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position.
iv Other In addition there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to crystallise.

Costs of 0.3 million in relation to a potential acquisition have been charged to the income statement.
As explained in note 1, acquisition accounting adjustments have been finalised in relation to the acquisition of Aeolus Industria e Comercio Ltda by Howden on 22 August 2008 and the 2008 comparatives included below have been restated accordingly.
During the year ended 31 December 2009, no adjustments have been made to the estimated fair value of the net assets of the other businesses acquired in 2008.
On 13 May 2009, ESAB completed the disposal of HD Engineering Limited, a manufacturer of drilling equipment, consumables and accessories with net assets of 3.1 million for a cash consideration of 1.7 million, net of disposal costs, resulting in a loss of 1.4 million.
Cumulative exchange translation gains previously taken directly to equity of 0.9 million have been recycled through the income statement following this disposal.
The cash inflow of 1.3 million, included in the cash flow statement, comprises the net cash consideration of 1.7 million less cash disposed of 0.4 million.

Initial consideration for the transaction was S$65.0 million in cash with a further payment in 2008 of S$2.7 million.
Additional consideration is payable to the extent that average EBIT for the 3 years to 31 December 2010 exceeds S$9.0 million.
The acquisition of Romar increases ESABs presence in midmarket automation equipment which is expected to become an increasingly important market segment given the worldwide shortage of skilled welding operatives.
Synergy opportunities are expected to arise, including through the crossselling of product to ESABs and Romars customer lists.
The revenue and profit after tax of Romar for the year ended 31 December 2008 were 16.5 million and 1.8 million respectively of which 6.1 million and 0.4 million respectively were for the period prior to acquisition.
ii Otheracquisitions a On 17 July 2008, ESAB agreed to acquire from a receiver the factory, plant and certain other assets of Linkweld, located near Milan, Italy, for a cash consideration of 3.6 million.
