Close Brothers Annual Report 2009 93 c Market risk Market risk is the risk that arises from adverse movements in equity, bond, interest rate, foreign exchange or other traded markets and arises primarily in our Securities division.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves which, as a matter of policy, are not hedged.
The groups policy is to match fixed and variable interest rate liabilities and assets utilising interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 15 on page 72.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At 31 July 2009 a 2.0% increase or a 0.5% decrease 2008: a 1.25% increase or a 1.25% decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: 2009 2008 million million 2.0% increase 2008: 1.25% increase 5.1 1.7 0.5% decrease 2008: 1.25% decrease 1.3 1.7 At 31 July 2009 a 2.0% increase or a 0.5% decrease 2008: a 1.25% increase or a 1.25% decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: 2009 2008 million million 2.0% increase 2008: 1.25% increase 3.6 1.2 0.5% decrease 2008: 1.25% decrease 0.9 1.2 Foreign currency risk The group has a number of currency investments in subsidiaries and associates and has chosen not to hedge those exposures.
These investments are predominantly in US dollars and euros.
In the event of a 20% strengthening in the value of sterling against the US dollar the groups equity would decrease by 18 million 2008: a 10% strengthening would have resulted in a decrease of 7 million.
In the event of a 20% strengthening in the value of sterling against the euro the groups equity would decrease by 8 million 2008: a 10% strengthening would have resulted in a decrease of 6 million.
The group would experience an equal and opposite increase in equity should sterling weaken against the US dollar and euro.
The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of activities in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, with exchange rate derivative contracts used where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 15 on page 72.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and small foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.
Financial risk management continued Other price risks Trading financial instruments: debt securities and equity shares The groups trading activities relate to Winterflood Securities Limited and Close Brothers Seydler AG.
The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk: Highest Lowest Average Exposure exposure exposure exposure at 31 July For the year ended 31 July 2009 million million million million Equities: Long 51.2 21.2 34.0 24.0 Short 29.9 6.8 13.0 14.1 21.0 9.9 Debt securities Long 124.0 16.6 43.5 37.9 Short 118.7 14.5 44.0 71.4 0.5 33.5 Highest Lowest Average Exposure exposure exposure exposure at 31 July For the year ended 31 July 2008 million million million million Equities: Long 74.8 38.4 52.6 38.6 Short 34.8 12.2 19.9 14.4 32.7 24.2 Debt securities Long 81.8 23.6 47.7 61.4 Short 75.9 21.5 42.0 24.1 5.7 37.3 With respect to the long and short positions on debt securities respectively, 11.9 million and 11.0 million 2008: 0.2 million and 0.3 million were due to mature within one year.
The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
The basis on which the trading book is valued each day is given in the accounting policies in note 1 q on page 59.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 1.0 million 2008: 2.4 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 3.4 million increase 2008: 3.7 million decrease on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly a jobbing business where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the result shown above is purely hypothetical.
Non-trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non trading financial instruments are disclosed in note 13 on page 70.
