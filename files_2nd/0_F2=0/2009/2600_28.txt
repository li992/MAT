To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
