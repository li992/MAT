co. uk 11 3 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Shareholder information continued Warning to shareholders boiler room scams Over the last year, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way: many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: N make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation: N check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved by visiting www.
uk register N report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or visiting www.
uk N if the calls persist, hang up.
