General information HomeServe plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 40.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: Amendments to IFRS7 Mar 2009 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments IFRS3 revised Jan 2008 Business Combinations Amendment to IAS23 Mar 2007 Borrowing Costs Amendments to IAS1 Sept 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments to IAS27 Jan 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Amendment to IFRS2 Jan 2008 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations Amendments to IAS32 and IAS1 Feb 2008 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation Amendments to IFRS1 and IAS27 May 2008 Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate Improvements to IFRSs 2008 May 2008 Improvements to IFRSs 2008 Amendment to IAS39 July 2008 Eligible Hedged Items Amendments to IAS39 and IFRS7 Oct 2008 Reclassification of Financial Assets Amendments to IAS39 and IFRS7 Nov 2008 Reclassification of Financial Assets Effective Date and Transition Amendments to IFRIC9 and IAS39 Mar 2009 Embedded Derivatives IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners IFRIC18 Transfers of Assets from Customers The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for IFRS3 Revised, whereby acquisition costs and adjustments to contingent consideration will be charged credited to the income statement.
IFRS3 Revised is expected to apply to the Group for the year ending 31 March 2011.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as set out in the Corporate governance statement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 75 The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Investments in joint ventures The Groups share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill.
Based on the guidance of IAS28 Investments in Associates, provision for the Groups share of the joint venture losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets below zero.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Membership businesses Revenue in respect of the UK and overseas Membership businesses include amounts receivable from the sale of policies, stated net of commissions payable and Insurance Premium Tax.
Revenue recorded by the Group consists of commissions due in the Groups role as an intermediary in the policy sale and administration process.
Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Groups role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue.
Consequently, revenue consists of a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission due for the marketing and sale of the policy.
Revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services.
In these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income.
The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historic actual costs.
The deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of expected claims over the policy period.
The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.

Significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition continued Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Revenue from contracts of reinsurance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies.
All associated costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
If claims costs under reinsurance contracts are expected to exceed revenue, the shortfall would be charged to the income statement immediately.
Emergency Services businesses Revenue represents amounts receivable, excluding VAT, from the sale of goods and services and is recognised on completion of the obligations relating to the work.
Revenue on sales to franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete.
Revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement.
These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures but before investment income and finance costs.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 77 Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 2550 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years Computer equipment 37 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.

Significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives, using the straight line method, as follows: Customer relationships 3-7 years Customer databases exclusive marketing agreements 3-7 years Franchise assets 3-15 years Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of three to seven years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 79 Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included within finance costs.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 Share-Based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provision, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
Own shares reserve Shares of the parent Company that are purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Benefit Trust are held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity.
Cost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable costs.
The shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes.

Judgements and estimation uncertainty Revenue recognition Within the Policy Membership businesses, an appropriate proportion of revenue is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods.
As a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations.
The Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is 175.7m 2008 restated: 218.1m.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 28.6m 2008: 47.6m.
Following the annual impairment review, an impairment charge of 59.2m has been recorded against goodwill and 17.0m against acquisition intangibles.
As set out in note 7 and 15, reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices and margins can impact the recoverable value.
Pensions The Group participates in a defined benefit retirement scheme for certain employees.
The scheme assets and liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 39.
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected unit credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.
Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Provision of services 517,441 554,875 Investment income note 10 1,353 1,102 518,794 555,977 5. Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Group is managed around four operating divisions UK Membership, Continental Europe, United States of America and UK Emergency Services, which has been shown as non-core.
During the year, the claims management and policy repair networks were moved from UK Emergency Services to UK Membership.
To ensure a consistent comparison to the new structure, the prior year segmental information taking account of segment eliminations has been restated.

The Groups revenue from external customers and information about its segment assets non-current assets excluding investments in joint ventures, deferred tax assets and other financial assets by geographical location are detailed below: Revenue from external customers Non-current assets 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 United Kingdom 461,287 527,817 213,777 296,714 Continental Europe 40,250 18,961 28,245 16,956 United States of America 15,904 8,097 11,977 9,569 517,441 554,875 253,999 323,239 Information about major customers There are no customers in either year from which the Group earns more than 10% of its revenues.
Exceptional operating costs The exceptional operating costs of 6,549,000 comprise 1,535,000 relating to the cessation of discussions with our second hub partner and 5,014,000 relating to the reorganisation of our UK businesses.
Impairment of UK Emergency Services assets The impairment charge of 97,184,000 consists of: 2009 2008 000 000 Impairment charge: Goodwill note 15 59,179 Acquisition intangible assets note 16 16,965 Software assets note 16 8,739 Property, plant and equipment note 17 5,149 Other net assets trade receivables note 21 7,152 97,184 As noted in the Chief Executives review, it has been a difficult year for our UK Emergency Services division, which continues to operate in challenging market conditions, with lower volumes and margin pressure.
Following the transfer of the claims management and policy repair networks from UK Emergency Services into UK Membership, the Board has commenced a disposal process of the UK Emergency Services division.
For this reason, the division has been shown as non-core.
As part of our annual impairment review note 15, we have reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other assets within the UK Emergency Services division to assess the recoverable value of each cash generating unit within this division.
Given the Boards decision to seek a disposal of the businesses within this division, our assessment of value in use is closely aligned with the estimated fair value less costs to sell these businesses.
As value is expected to be realised principally through a disposal process, fair value less costs to sell has been based on a price-earnings methodology.
This has been compared to external sources of information such as indicative preliminary valuations of the businesses, taking account of usual commercial negotiations to obtain an agreed sales consideration for the businesses.
The resulting estimated fair value has not been discounted due to the current expectation of a disposal within the next 12 months.
Costs have been estimated with reference to disposal proceeds, and estimates of professional fees to be incurred on the transaction, supported by indicative fees from advisers.

Impairment of UK Emergency Services assets continued Based on the impairment review, the recoverable value suggests an impairment of 97,184,000.
This has been allocated to the cash generating units of the Emergency Services division, initially to goodwill, then to other non-current assets.
A further 7,152,000 has been allocated to trade receivables, representing a surplus of the impairment over the non current assets for certain of the cash generating units within the division.
In light of the challenging market conditions facing the division, a reasonably possible change in the judgements around sales margins and volume of work could result in an increase or decrease in the recoverable value.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Loss earnings per share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings loss per share is based on the following data: Core Total Core Total 2009 2009 2008 2008 000 000 000 000 Profit loss for the year 56,436 35,306 47,219 49,276 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles 3,664 12,105 2,251 10,320 Exceptional operating costs note 6 2,317 6,549 2,154 2,154 Impairment of UK Emergency Services assets note 7 97,184 Tax impact arising on amortisation of acquisition intangibles, impairment and exceptional operating costs 1,477 13,611 1,309 3,706 Adjusted profit for the year 60,940 66,921 50,315 58,044 Weighted average number of shares 000 Basic 62,878 62,412 Dilutive impact of share options 2,003 2,456 Diluted 64,881 64,868 The adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the amortisation of acquisition intangibles, exceptional operating costs and impairment.
This is considered to be a better indicator of the performance of the Group.
As profit loss for the year and adjusted profit for the year are stated after tax, it is not considered necessary to include in the above reconciliation the impact of the adjustment for the tax on joint ventures of 1,941,000 2008: 991,000.

Goodwill 000 Cost At 1 April 2007 189,039 Recognised on acquisitions 32,119 Reduction in consideration 3,088 At 1 April 2008 restated 218,070 Recognised on acquisitions note 35 16,776 At 31 March 2009 234,846 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 April 2007, 1 April 2008 Impairment note 7 59,179 At 31 March 2009 59,179 Carrying amount At 31 March 2009 175,667 At 31 March 2008 restated 218,070 During the year, the contingent consideration payable on the 2008 acquisition of Anglia NW Limited was reduced by 3,088,000.
Goodwill on the acquisition has been reduced accordingly, with the goodwill and contingent consideration being restated in the comparative period.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: Restated 2009 2008 000 000 Minority interest buy-out 66,940 66,940 Other Policy Businesses comprising several CGUs 70,191 59,334 UK Membership 137,131 126,274 Glass & Locks 22,296 38,983 Improveline 6,458 Property Repairs 9,533 Chem-Dry 7,141 Contents Services 2,246 Anglia 14,134 Other Emergency Services Businesses comprising several CGUs 2,667 UK Emergency Services 22,296 81,162 Reparalia 10,634 10,634 SPT 5,606 Continental Europe 16,240 10,634 United States of America 175,667 218,070 During the year, following the transfer of claims management and policy repair networks from UK Emergency Services to UK Membership, 4,846,000 goodwill has been transferred to UK Membership in the prior year analysis.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 89 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares annual cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Directors and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5% 2008: 2.5% representing long-term growth rates based in respective country GDP rates.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 11.3% 2008: 11.3%.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
Details in respect of the impairment of the non-core UK Emergency Services division, including assessment of the most likely reasonably possible changes which could impact upon the carrying value, are set out in note 7.
In respect of the Groups other businesses, the key assumptions are as noted above.
Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, takes account of the headroom in managements internal growth targets verses the conservative growth estimates used in the impairment review.
Other intangible assets continued Acquisition intangibles represent non-monetary assets separately identifiable from goodwill and include customer relationships, customer databases exclusive marketing agreements and franchise assets relating to purchased franchise licences.
At the balance sheet date, there are no contractual commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment 2008: nil.
Subsidiaries A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in note 47 to the Companys separate financial statements.
The Groups share of the above results is only 3,451,000 2008: 1,755,000 reflecting the net liabilities of the Domo Assistance joint venture in the current and prior year.
In respect of Domo Assistance, the Groups unrecognised share of losses for the year is 42,000 2008: 311,000 and share of cumulative losses is 353,000 2008: 311,000.
Based on the guidance of IAS28 Investments in Associates, provision for the Groups share of joint venture profits losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Groups share of joint ventures net assets below zero.
In respect of the interests in joint ventures, there are no capital commitments or contingent liabilities which require disclosure 2008: nil.

Other financial assets continued Trade receivables The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover.
This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
In addition, an impairment of 7,152,000 has been included to recognise the surplus of the UK Emergency Services assets impairment against the pre-impairment carrying value of the non-current assets, for certain cash generating units within the division.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
5.6m 2008: 5.9m is due from Royal Bank of Scotland, the Groups largest customer.
There are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 20.9m 2008: 32.4m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 62 days 2008: 37 days.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2009 2008 000 000 130 days 8,450 13,910 3160 days 2,930 5,524 6190 days 1,503 3,858 91 days 8,304 9,118 Balance at 31 March past due but not impaired 21,187 32,410 Current 118,863 84,164 Balance at 31 March 140,050 116,574 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2009 2008 000 000 At 1 April 3,461 3,024 Acquisitions 713 Impairment losses recognised 2,102 1,112 Recognised as part of UK Emergency Services impairment note 7 7,152 Amounts written off as uncollectible 1,097 924 Amounts recovered during the year 39 464 Balance at 31 March 11,579 3,461 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2009 2008 000 000 130 days 296 402 3160 days 641 83 6190 days 559 232 91 days 10,083 2,744 11,579 3,461 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2009 93 Other receivables As part of our activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for components such as underwriting fees, commission and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 21,345,000 2008: 47,198,000 comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments 2009 2008 000 000 Derivatives that are designated and effective as hedging instruments carried at fair value Interest rate swap 1,947 The interest rate swap is to hedge loans subject to variable interest rates linked to LIBOR, with a fixed interest rate.

Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities continued The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: i.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The Group has revolving credit facilities with a number of banks totalling 150m 2008: 150m.
The revolving credit facility was taken out on 20 December 2007 and has a term of five years.
Loan notes are repayable on demand, subject to a minimum initial maturity of six months.
All of the Groups borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of between 0.1% and 1% above LIBOR, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
v. The covenants associated with the credit facilities are net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.5 times and interest cover greater than 4 times operating profit before amortisation.
The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
During the previous year, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional value of 50.0m.
This interest rate swap is for a further one year, and requires fixed interest payments of 4.93%, in return for one month LIBOR.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had available 95.0m 2008: 60.0m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior year: Timings differences Unremitted Elected Retirement Acquired including accelerated overseas goodwill benefit Share intangible Unutilised Acquired tax depreciation profits deductions obligations schemes assets losses property Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2007 1,118 194 8,168 6,898 426 561 211 Reclassification 308 308 Reclassification to current tax 170 170 Charge credit to income 364 1,536 67 1,042 2,764 554 37 1,322 Charge credit to equity 194 609 12 427 Acquisitions 45 4,480 1,701 2,824 At 1 April 2008 1,049 1,844 67 9,819 8,614 1,573 512 694 Credit charge to income 3,800 626 17 489 6,206 519 10 9,403 Credit charge to equity 537 4,777 4,240 Exchange differences 426 426 Acquisitions 706 706 At 31 March 2009 2,751 2,470 84 537 4,553 3,114 2,518 502 4,189 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: Continental 2009 2008 UK Europe USA 000 000 Deferred tax assets 4,553 1,298 1,220 7,071 11,392 Deferred tax liabilities 2,882 2,882 12,086 Net deferred tax asset liability 1,671 1,298 1,220 4,189 694 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 23.7m 2008: 19.8m available for offset against future profits and which can be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax asset of 2,518,000 has been recognised in respect of these losses deferred tax has not been recognised on the remainder of these losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures are not material.
Current liabilities trade and other payables Restated note 15 2009 2008 000 000 Trade creditors and accruals 123,051 109,646 Contingent consideration 2,631 3,716 Deferred consideration 2,364 4,155 Payments in advance 1,315 732 Deferred income 894 4,221 Taxes and social security, excluding current tax 5,660 5,643 Other creditors 70,118 73,122 206,033 201,235 Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 68 days 2008: 67 days.
Other creditors mainly represent liabilities for amounts to be collected from policyholders in respect of underwriting fees, commission and Insurance Premium Tax.

Business combinations continued Fair value adjustments to the acquired underlying book value of assets and liabilities, prior to the recognition of intangible assets identified on acquisition, were not significant, and in summary terms consisted of: SPT Acquired book value of net assets of 801,000, reduced by 133,000 for provision against certain receivables and to recognise additional liabilities Other Acquired book value of net assets of 1,618,000, reduced by 386,000 principally to recognise impairment against redundant fixed assets.
As these adjustments were not significant, no separate tabular summary of pre-adjusted balance sheets, together with analysis of the line items that these adjustments relate to, has been presented.
The provisional fair values, after the adjustments noted above, together with the assessment of the fair value of intangible assets identified on acquisition, are set out in the table below: Endesa SPT policies Other Total 000 000 000 000 Net assets acquired: Property, plant and equipment 502 301 803 Intangible assets 8 8 Inventories 35 35 Trade and other receivables 594 1,536 2,130 Cash and cash equivalents 1,587 769 2,356 Trade and other payables 1,255 1,471 2,726 Deferred tax liability asset 768 62 706 668 1,232 1,900 Intangible assets identified on acquisition 2,742 4,026 6,768 Goodwill 5,606 11,170 16,776 Total consideration 9,016 4,026 12,402 25,444 Satisfied by: Cash 4,893 539 11,963 17,395 Contingent consideration 3,869 3,869 Deferred consideration 3,387 3,387 Directly attributable costs 254 100 439 793 9,016 4,026 12,402 25,444 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 5,147 639 12,402 18,188 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 1,587 769 2,356 3,560 639 11,633 15,832 Intangible assets identified on the acquisitions of SPT and Endesa policies represent the Directors estimate of the value of the customer relationships at acquisition, the expected value of trade names associated with the business or the value of acquired customer policy databases.

Share based payments During the year ended 31 March 2009, the Group had 6 2008: 6 share based payment arrangements, which are described below: i Executive Share Option Plan ESOP The ESOP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period.
In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependant upon a share price target.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
ii 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan KEIP The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
The number of awards vesting is dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2009 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009.
iii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP provides for the grant of nil cost options.
The vesting period is between three and five years and is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant performance period.
iv Deferred Bonus Plan DBP The Deferred Bonus Plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company.
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper decile performance.
The shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
v Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount.
The options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
vi Conditional Share Schemes CSS Awards under the Conditional Share Scheme vest in three tranches on the first 25%, second 25% and third 50% anniversary of the grant.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 14.87 2008: 18.31.

Share based payments continued The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan.
The assumptions used in the models are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 20% - 30% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 3.8% - 5.2% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
The Group recognised total expenses of 3,217,000 2008: 4,131,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions fully vesting, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
The total cost charged to income of 2,890,000 2008: 2,847,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
At 31 March 2009, contributions of nil 2008: nil due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, for qualifying employees.
This is a sectionalised final salary scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme.
The Section funds are administered by the trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuarial adviser.
The Section has a history of raising pensions in line with price inflation, and these increases are reflected in the measurement of the obligation.
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008 were updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS19.
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation, the past service cost and the current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.

Insurance contracts During previous years the Group, through its subsidiary Affinity Partners Limited, entered into contracts of reinsurance with an independent insurance Company that underwrites the policies marketed and administered by HomeServe Membership Limited.
Under these arrangements, Affinity Partners Limited underwrote 49% of the risk and reward associated with these policies the policies.
The policies were entered into between the customers of HomeServe Membership Limited and an independent insurance company in the United Kingdom only.
The policies are principally in relation to underwritten cover for a broad range of domestic emergencies relating to Plumbing and Drains, Electrical Wiring, Water and Gas Supply Pipes and Gas Boilers.
Revenue from the reinsurance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies typically 12 months, reflecting the period of benefit to the customer.
Where the reinsurance premium is received in advance, an appropriate amount is included within deferred income.
The costs associated with the claims received under the contract of reinsurance are recognised as they are incurred.
An assessment is made of whether the expected cash inflows under the reinsurance contracts are sufficient to meet the expected future claims costs under the reinsurance contracts.
If a shortfall were to arise, this would be charged immediately to the income statement.
Affinity Partners ceased to underwrite new policies from 1 October 2007.
The amounts recognised by the Group in respect of reinsurance contracts are as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Revenue 3,505 39,421 Claims costs 2,012 34,509 Deferred income 3,036 The principal impact on the amount of claims incurred under the reinsurance contracts relate to weather conditions, which can impact the frequency of claims and the nature of the emergency.
In order to assist in managing the risk arising from the policies, the claims costs are fixed for each type of emergency repair.
There is no concentration of insurance risk due to the immaterial size of each of the policies.
Neither the policies or the reinsurance contract are exposed to any significant liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, nor are there any exposures relating to embedded derivatives.
As the policies relate to emergency repairs and generally cover a 12 month period, all cash outflows are expected to occur within 12 months from the date of commencement of the policies.
On a weighted average basis, across all policies, a 1 percentage point increase in claims frequencies would result in additional claims costs of nil 2008: 0.1m.
Financial instruments Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group and the Company from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows: Group Company cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities trade receivables trade receivables loans to joint ventures inter-company receivables and payables trade payables trade payables loan notes All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 23, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 27 to 34.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2009 2008 000 000 Shareholders funds 212,984 265,413 Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities 55,000 90,000 Unsecured loan notes 300 304 Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the Financial Services Authority.
Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations.
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups principal financial instruments, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and cash and cash equivalents.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, derivatives and loans to joint ventures which arise directly from its operations.
Classification of financial instruments In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 21, 23 and 25, the Group has derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships with a notional value of 50.0m 2008: 50.0m and a carrying value and fair value of 1,947,000 liability 2008: nil.
The fair value of these derivative instruments has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates, sourced from observable market data.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.

It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had in place an interest rate swap to hedge loans subject to variable interest rates linked to LIBOR whereby it receives a floating rate of interest based on one month LIBOR on a notional principal of 50m 2008: 50m and pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.9% 2008: 4.9%.
The remaining term of the interest rate swap is one year.
The fair value of the interest rate swap at 31 March 2009 was 1,947,000 liability 2008: nil.
The timing of the impact on the income statement of the swap is up to one year from the balance sheet date.
The impact of the cash flow hedge on the income statement will be expensed through the finance cost line.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
In addition, receivable balances within our Emergency Services business are monitored on an ongoing basis.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 23 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within one year, based on contractual payment terms.
