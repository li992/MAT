For prior years, underlying also excludes profits on disposal of subsidiaries, impairment of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment, takeover bid defence costs, pension scheme payments relating to scheme settlements and effects of changes in corporate tax rates as disclosed in note 3 to the accounts.
ii EBITDA LBITDA is operating profit loss before depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment.
iii Operating loss profit is defined as revenue less operating expenses before impairment of available for sale financial assets, finance income and expenses and share of profit of associate and joint venture.
iv The income tax expense substantially relates to overseas taxation and includes net exchange losses of $38 million 2008 exchange gains of $88 million as disclosed in note 7. v During the year the Group undertook a Rights Issue of shares.
As a result the 2009 LPS and diluted LPS and the 2008 EPS and diluted EPS and dividends per share figures have been adjusted to the date of issue to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue as disclosed in note 8. vi Diluted loss earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by dilutive outstanding share options.
For the year ended 30 September 2009 outstanding share options were anti-dilutive and so have been excluded from diluted loss per share in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share.
