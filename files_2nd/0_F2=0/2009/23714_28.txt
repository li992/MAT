This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied or are partially occupied by the Company.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to 11 years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases and sub-leases are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time including market rent reviews and break-options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.
The amount included within Profit and Loss in respect of unwinding of the discount on onerous premises provisions in 2009 is 0.1m 2008: 0.3m.
Pension Plan Guarantee The Company has agreed to provide the F&C Asset Management Pension Plan FCAM Plan Trustees with a guarantee that should F&C Asset Management Services Limited become insolvent, the Company will guarantee an amount up to the lower of the cost of securing members benefits with an insurance company over the assets of the FCAM Plan the solvency deficit and 120.0m.
The provision represents the actuarial estimate of the fair value of the guarantee at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.
Investment Trust VAT In November 2007, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC agreed that management services to UK Investment Trust Companies ITCs should be exempt from VAT.
As a result, the Company, in common with other asset managers in the UK, received claims from ITCs for the repayment of VAT charged to them for historic periods dating back to 1990.
While the Company charged VAT in accordance with applicable UK law at the time, a provision was recognised in 2007 to the extent that the expected payments to be made to ITCs were greater than the expected amount recoverable from HMRC.
During 2008 and 2009, monies refunded from HMRC were paid, as required, to ITCs.
However, due to the complexity of the repayment process and its interaction with contractual arrangements, uncertainty existed at 31 December 2008 as to the final cost to be incurred by the Company.
During 2009 all amounts due to ITCs have been settled and the remainder of the provision of 0.7m was released to the Profit and Loss Account.
No provision is therefore required at 31 December 2009.

Provisions for liabilities continued Deferred tax The deferred tax provision relates to short-term timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the timing of the reversal of the timing differences.
The provision relates to the revaluation of available for sale assets and is recognised as a separate component of reserves.
A further analysis of deferred taxation is disclosed in note 13.
Put option guarantee Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements outlines the circumstances surrounding the put option notice received from the two founder members of F&C Partners LLP Partners, the Groups majority owned fund of hedge funds business, together with the quantum of the provision recognised.
While a provision of 2.4m has been recognised in F&C Alternative Investment Holdings Limited, a subsidiary company, the Company, through the Partnership Agreement, has guaranteed any amounts validly due to the founder members to the extent that F&C Alternative Investment Holdings Limited is unable to meet such obligations.
A corresponding provision of 2.4m has therefore been recognised in the Companys Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2009.

Share-based payment F&C REIT variable minority interest share-based payment SBP Details of this share-based payment award are disclosed in note 28 c to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension commitments Until 31 March 2007, the Company operated a defined benefit pension plan The F&C Asset Management Pension Plan in the UK, which provides benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The sponsoring company and principal employer for the scheme changed on 31 March 2007.
Consequently the pension obligation was transferred to F&C Asset Management Services Limited on that date and F&C Asset Management plc ceased to incur a direct charge in respect of the scheme.
The Company has subsequently provided a guarantee in respect of this plan.
Further details are described in note 10.
