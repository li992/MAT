As stated in note 22, John Crane, Inc. JCI is involved in numerous law suits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of JCI, the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
Provision has been made for the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
The Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by this provision: however, because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of litigation beyond this period, the cost of adverse judgments cannot be reliably estimated.
