136 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 Share-based payments Share-based payment plans in operation during the year The Group had the following share-based payment plans in operation during the year: Performance Share Plan PSP This plan involves the award of shares to participants subject to performance conditions.
Vesting of the performance shares is based on the achievement of both non-market based conditions EPS and cash flow per share and a market based performance condition total shareholder return TSR.
ShareSave share option plan Based on a threeor five-year monthly savings contract, eligible employees are granted share options with an exercise price of up to 20 per cent below the share price when the contract is entered into.
Vesting of the options is not subject to the achievement of a performance target.
In the UK, the plan is HM Revenue & Customs approved.
Overseas, employees in 33 countries participate in ShareSave plans through arrangements which provide broadly comparable benefits to the UK plan.
From 2007 onwards, the overseas schemes are cash-settled schemes.
Executive Share Option Plan ESOP This plan involved the grant of market value share options to participants.
It expired in 2009 and no further grants may be made.
Remaining options under the plan are subject to a non-market based performance condition growth in EPS and have a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Annual Performance Related Award APRA plan deferred shares Deferred shares are awarded as part of the APRA plan.
One third of the value of any annual bonus is delivered in the form of a deferred share award.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for two years from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares.
During the two year deferral period, participants are entitled to receive dividends, or equivalent, on the deferred shares.
For deferred share awards made from 2010 onwards, forty per cent of the value of any annual bonus will be delivered in the form of a deferred share award.
Share Incentive Plan SIP This is the Free Share element of the UK Share Incentive Plan.
Eligible UK employees may receive shares as part of the Company component of any bonus paid.
There are no conditions attached to the shares.
Further information regarding the operation of the plans can be found on pages 81 to 83 of the Directors remuneration report.

Fair values The weighted average fair values per share for PSP awards, ShareSave grants, APRA deferred share awards, and SIP Free Share awards included in the expense for the year were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 PSP awards 25% TSR uplift 253p 458p 557p 494p 282p PSP awards 50% TSR uplift 282p n a n a n a n a ShareSave 3 year grants 144p 230p 131p ShareSave 5 year grants 167p 264p 154p APRA deferred share awards 290p 440p 502p 448p 260p SIP Free Share awards 330p 439p 499p 462p 257p Details of the assumptions used in the calculation of these fair values are set out below.
Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the seven years prior to the grant or award date.
Until 2007, expected dividends were based on the Companys payments to shareholders over the five years prior to the grant or award date.
From 2008, expected dividends are based on the Companys payments to shareholders in respect of the previous year.
PSP awards The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP are calculated using the market value of shares at the time of the award adjusted to take into account non-entitlement to dividends or equivalent during the vesting period and the TSR performance condition.
The PSP fair values were calculated using the following assumptions: 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Weighted average share price 260p 430p 501p 444p 262p Expected dividends 14.70p 13.00p 8.30p 7.92p 7.81p Volatility 32% 29% 29% 32% 34% Correlation 35% 29% 26% 19% 19% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk free interest rate 1.9% 4.1% 5.2% 4.3% 4.9% Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2009 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review 138 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 Share-based payments continued As explained on page 82 of the Directors remuneration report, the PSP has a TSR market-based performance condition, such that the Companys TSR over the performance period will be compared with the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index on the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR exceeds the median TSR of the FTSE 100, the number of shares that vest will be increased by 25 per cent.
For conditional awards made from 2009 onwards, a further stretch was incorporated for certain senior executives, such that if TSR performance exceeds the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 index, awards are increased by 50 per cent, with straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance.
The fair values of the awards of shares under the PSP have been adjusted to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share-price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the shareprice at the date of grant.
ShareSave awards The fair value of options granted under the ShareSave plan are calculated using a binomial pricing model with the following assumptions: 2009 2007 2005 2003 Weighted average share price 462p 553p 351p 173p Exercise price 387p 416p 298p 142p Volatility 36% 37% 40% 43% Expected dividends 14.30p 8.80p 7.86p 7.61p 1 Expected life 3 year ShareSave 3.3-3.8 years 3.3-3.8 years 3.3-3.8 years 3.2-3.7 years 5 year ShareSave 5.3-5.8 years 5.3-5.8 years 5.3-5.8 years 5.2-5.7 years Risk free interest rate 2.4% 5.0% 4.4% 4.6% 1 The binomial pricing model assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
Deferred shares under APRA and Free Shares under SIP The fair value of shares awarded under these plans is calculated as the share price on the date of the award.
