When IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009, it is not expected to lead to additional segmental disclosures.
Basis of accounting The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements of the Company have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
As discussed in the Directors Report, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible adverse changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current financing arrangements.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
In the Companys accounts investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the income statement to the extent that they represent a realised profit and loss for the Company.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal dispensation not to present its own income statement.
The amount of the profit for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements.
c. Transaction date accounting All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
d. Foreign currencies The Groups functional currency is Sterling.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities have been translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Transactions during the period have been translated into Sterling at the rates ruling at the time the transactions were executed.
All exchange differences are reflected in the income statement, except for any exchange differences arising on any non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
e. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents gross commission, investment management fees and investment banking retainers, other fees plus other income, excluding VAT, receivable in respect of the period.
Investment management fees and investment banking retainers are recognised in the period in which the related service is provided and investment management commissions are recognised when the transaction is performed.
Other fees including corporate finance fees and placing commissions are taken to the income statement when payment is contractually due.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
f. Operating profit Operating profit is stated as being profit before finance income, finance costs and tax.
g. Other operating income Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Groups share of interest receivable and included under the heading Other operating income.
h. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
Leases Annual rentals on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
j. Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued j. Share-based payments continued The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled sharebased payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
k. Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
l. Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit and loss and is not reversed.
Elements of the total cost of an acquisition may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the acquisition indicates the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date, potentially leading to adjustments in the value of goodwill balances.
Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares see note 3 r. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
ii Client relationships Intangible assets classified as client relationships are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of investment managers.
Client relationships are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
If acquired as part of a busi ness combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
When separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of investment managers, elements of the total consideration may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the recognised client relationships includes the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date.
Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares see note 3 r. Client relationships are amortised over seven to fifteen years, their minimum estimated useful lives.
42 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC l. Intangible assets continued iii Computer software Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Costs of acquiring computer software are treated as an intangible asset and amortised over four years on a straight line basis from the date the software comes into use.
Computer software developed internally is separately identified and recognised as an intangible asset if it is part of a specifically authorised project which will give probable future economic benefits over a period of not less than four years, and is amortised over four years on a straight line basis from the date the software comes into use.
m. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 4 years Office equipment 4 to 10 years Leasehold improvements over 5 years n. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets Investments are recognised and derecognised on trade date, where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, held to maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the financial asset is held-for-trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporate any dividends or interest earned on the financial asset.
Their value is determined in the manner described in note 18.
Available-for-sale financial assets Certain shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 18.
Gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Where the investment is disposed of or is determin ed to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is included in profit or loss for the period.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in profit and loss when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.
p. Netting of balances Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts.
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle against delivery of stock are shown gross.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 43 Notes to the Financial Statements continued q.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
r. Shares to be issued including premium Shares to be issued represent the Companys best estimate of the amount of ordinary shares in the Company, which are likely to be issued following business combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Companys shares.
The sum is discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and is revised annually in the light of actual results.
The resulting interest charge from the unwind of the discount is included within finance costs.
Where shares are due to be issued within a year then the sum is included in current liabilities.
Where the team of investment managers, bringing with them funds under management, have not yet joined and the client relationships assets have not been brought into use, the resultant liability is shown as an amount contracted for but not provided in the accounts.
s. Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the profit or l oss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
t. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of impairment testing, client relationships and goodwill are allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Fair value is established by valuing clients funds under management in each of the cash-generating units based on the value of funds under management at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
If the carrying amount relating to any cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated fair value less costs to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Change in accounting policy After a long and constructive dialogue with the Financial Reporting Review Panel the Group has considered the additional clarification which the forthcoming standard IFRS 3 2008 brings to the recognition of intangible assets and the various practices currently applied by other firms in the purchase of investment management businesses, and has retrospectively changed its accounting policy.
Payments to acquire teams of investment managers, bringing with them funds under management, have been re-classified as the intangible asset client relationships, rather than goodwill.
Similarly intangible assets representing client relationships acquired as part of business combinations have been recognised separately to goodwill.
The new accounting policy is considered preferable as it brings us into line with our peers and is more transparent.
This new accounting policy has been applied r etrospectively from the date of the Groups transition to IFRS and the comparative figures for 2008 in these financial statements have been restated.
Opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2007 have been reduced by 2.2m after deferred taxation which is the cumulative amount of the adjustment relating to periods prior to 2008.
The main changes to our financial statements are presented below: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Prior to Following change of change of Previously accounting accounting policy policy reported As restated 000 000 000 000 Profit before tax and amortisation 28,505 28,505 36,202 36,202 Amortisation of the intangible asset - client relationships 6,566 4,244 Profit before tax 28,505 21,939 36,202 31,958 Taxation 8,242 6,404 11,127 9,939 Profit after taxation 20,263 15,535 25,075 22,019 Basic earning per share post amortisation 9.6p 7.4p 12.2p 10.7p Fully diluted earning per share post amortisation 9.4p 7.2p 11.7p 10.3p 2009 2009 2008 2008 Prior to Following change of change of accounting accounting Previously policy policy reported As restated 000 000 000 000 Net assets 128,230 118,219 125,176 119,893 Intangible assets Goodwill 99,095 48,438 93,023 48,376 Client relationships 36,753 37,309 99,095 85,191 93,023 85,685 Deferred tax asset liability 3,041 852 3,993 1,938 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 5.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and profits and losses.
Evaluation of the accounting judgements takes into account historical experience as well as future expectations.
Retirement benefit obligation In conjunction with the Groups Actuary, the Group makes estimates about a range of long term trends, including life expectancy.
These estimates are governed by the rules set out in IAS 19 Employee Benefits which inevitably lead to significant swings in the pension deficit from year to year, as long term interest rates change and short term market movements affect asset valuations.
The detailed assumptions are set out in note 26.
Shares to be issued including premium and def erred purchase consideration The Group includes within these headings its best estimate discounted to present value of the ultimate sum which will be paid for businesses or client relationships under deferred purchase agreements.
This is inevitably judgemental and depends on events which transpire over periods up to five years.
Market conditions are an important factor.
Impairment of goodwill and client relationships For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group values goodwill and client relationships based on the valuation of individual units making up the relevant intangible asset.
For an investment management business this is normally based on the value of funds under management at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
A price earnings basis is used where more appropriate.
Valuation of investment in Euroclear plc The fair valuation of the Groups investment in Euroclear plc is based upon the Groups share of net assets, dividend yield and the prices of similar quoted companies discounted for marketability.
This calculation inevitably includes a number of areas of judgement.

The date for settlement is determined when the trade is booked.
It is expected that some transactions may become past due in the normal course of business.

Shares to be issued including premium and other d eferred purchase liabilities The Group acquires investment businesses and teams of investment managers, bringing with them funds under management the latter classified as the intangible asset client relationships on deferred purchase terms based on the value of income introduced over, normally, a three year period.
The payment is normally made in ordinary shares and these shares typically have to be held for a further three years.
At the discretion of the Board these shares can be purchased in the market rather than issued.
The estimated likely cost of these shares is reassessed annually, see notes 3 r and 5.
At the period end there was a net upward assessment of 0.6m 2008: net upward 2.5m.
These adjustments are inevitably subjective and dependent on events, influenced by market conditions.
The other side of the liability is recorded in intangible assets, goodwill and or client relationships, depending on the type of acquisition see note 15.
Each individual transaction has a cap as to the maximum value that could be paid out.
The value of the cap is always set at a value substantially above what it is expected will be paid out.
The total value of these caps is 12m 2008: 15m for shares to be issued within one year, 93.7m 2008: 83m for shares to be issued from one to five years, with a further potential of 2m 2008: 3m in relation to expenditure contracted for but not provided in the accounts which would be payable in 2012 13.
In the event of the Group being acquired by a third party, provisions exist to renegotiate the deferred purchase consideration into the shares of the acquiring entity, or for the deferred settlement period to be truncated.

Financial instruments and risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: market risk: credit risk: liquidity risk: and operational risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups policy and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management considers the major areas of market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
The Board determines the risk appetite and is responsible for the implementation of a risk management framework that recognises the risks faced by the Group.
Authority flows from the Board to the Risk Management Committee RMC and from there to specific committees which are integral to the management of risk.
Brewin Dolphins activities involve the measurement, evaluation, acceptance and management of some degree of risk, or combination of risks.
The Board has set a low risk appetite whilst recognising the inevitable risk of being exposed to adverse movements in the stock market.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The Audit Committee oversees how management monito rs compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its role by Internal Audit.
The Audit Committees key role in risk management is the assessment of controls that are in place to mitigate risk and the review of the Risk Management Schedule bi-annually which is prepared by the RMC.
Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group and Company consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 29.
The Group has an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA for establishing the amount of regulatory capital to be held by the Group: Brewin Dolphin Limited BDL is the only regulated entity within the Group.
The ICAAP draws on the Groups Annual Corporate Risk Review which is based on bi-annual risk assessments.
It gives consideration to both current and projected financial and capital positions.
The ICAAP is updated throughout the year to take account of the bi-annual risk assessments and for any significant changes to business plans and any unexpected issues that may occur.
The ICAAP is discussed and approved at a Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Board meeting at least annually.
Capital adequacy is monitored daily by management.
The Group uses the simplified approach to Credit Risk and the standardised approach for Operational Risk to calculate Pillar 1 requirements.
The Group observed the FSAs regulatory requirements throughout the period.
The regulatory capital resources of the Group calculated in accordance with FSA definitions were as follows: Restated 27 September 28 September 2009 2008 000 000 Tier 1 capital resources Ordinary share capital 2,122 2,080 Share premium account 94,140 90,145 Retained earnings 18,612 18,342 Merger reserve 4,562 4,562 Shares to be issued 22,441 25,179 141,877 140,308 Deduction Intangible assets 89,605 85,685 52,272 54,623 Tier 2 capital resources Revaluation reserve 6,885 6,898 Deductions 6,885 6,898 Tier 1 plus tier 2 capital resources 59,157 61,521 Deduction Material holdings 4,084 3,848 Total capital before deductions 55,073 57,673 Deductions from total capital 579 618 Total capital resources after deductions 54,494 57,055 Total capital requirement 43,659 31,653 includes adjustment for defined pension liability in accordance with FSA rules.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups market risk management is to both control and manage our exposure within the Groups risk appetite whilst accepting the inherent risk of market fluctuations.
The Group acts as an Investment Manager and agency stockbroker within the UK: all trades are matched in the market.
The Group undertakes only limited principal trading on its own behalf: a maximum gross position of 2 million has been set as a limit by the Board.
No single trade or accumulative position in any one stock can be in excess of 0.5 million.
A hurdle stop loss price is operated in which the stop loss is set at a fixed percentage below the market price.
This sets a limit on the maximum possible loss, as the stop loss will be triggered if the market price drops below the level set, resulting in the stock being sold.
Conversely, where the market price rises the stop loss price will rise proportionately, to set a new stop loss price, thus protecting any profits.
The stop loss position is monitored on average three times a day and is recalculated when necessary.
Principal trading positions are monitored daily by the Risk Management Department and closing positions are reported to management.
Any breaches of limits are notified immediately to management, as are stop losses, which are enforced.
The Group policy is to never underwrite without full sub-underwriting in place.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
The total net foreign exchange exposure at the year end was a creditor of 673,000 2008: 342,000 debtor.
The Group does not hold any derivatives.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Equity price risk The Group is exposed to equity risk a rising from its available-for-sale investments and those held-for-trading.
Equity investments designated as available-for-sale are held for strategic purposes rather than trading purposes and the Group does not actively trade in these investments.
Equity price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
If equity prices had been 5% higher lower:  profit for the 52 week period ended 27 September 2009 would have been 29,000 27,000 higher lower 2008: 37,000 52,000 higher lower due to change in the value of held-for-trading investments and available-for-sale investments: and  other equity reserves as at 27 September 2009 would increase decrease by 528,000 2008: increase by 531,000 decrease by 516,000 for the Group as a result of the changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments.
The Groups sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior period.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk: this arises because the interest rate paid to its clients on their deposits is linked to the base rate.
The Group holds client deposits on both fixed rate short term deposit and on demand.
At the period end, 100 million was held on 40 day terms, with the balance of client monies held on demand.
At the end of the period a 1% increase in base rate would increase profitability by 390,000 2008: increase profitability by 200,000.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a client or other counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises principally from the settlement of client and market transactions and cash deposited at banks.
The Group uses the simplified approach to calculate credit risk as defined by the FSA.
The aim of the Groups approach to credit risk management is to minimise the risk as far as possible.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and clients and with collateral held, in the main, in Group nominee companies which helps to mitigate credit risk.
The collateral held consists of equity and gilts quoted on recognised exchanges plus cash.
The Group undertakes traded options as part of its service to clients, this is an insignificant part of the Groups business.
This business is transacted as principal as per the LIFFE rules, all such transactions are always on a matched basis, clients are required to pledge collateral if they hold option positions, which are monitored on a daily basis.
Maximum exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is equal to the balance sheet figure.
Credit exposure Credit exposure in relation to both client and market transactions is monitored daily.
The Groups exposure to large trades is limited with an average bargain size of 35,000: there are additional controls for high value trades.
Impaired assets The total gross amount of individually impaired assets in relation to trade receivables at the period end was 820,000 2008: 1,169,500.
Collateral valued at fair value by the Group in relation to these impaired assets was 128,000 2008: 34,500.
The net difference has been provided as a doubtful debt see note 19. Credit quality Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired in respect of trade receivables relate mainly to bonds, equity and gilt trades quoted on a recognised exchange, are matched in the market, and are either traded on a cash against documents basis or against a clients portfolio in respect of which any one trade would normally be a small percentage of the clients collateral held in the Group nominee.
At the period end no financial assets, that would otherwise be past due or impaired had been renegotiated.
Loans to employees are repayable over 5 to 10 years and are secured against the employees shareholdings in the Company see note 19.
The credit risk on liquid funds, cash and cash equivalents is limited due to deposits being held at three major banks with minimum credit rating of A, assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Deposits are managed by the Treasury Department and are reviewed regularly by the Management Committee.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 63 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The Group carries out at least an annual review of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to credit risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to risk that the Group will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains adequate cash resources to meet its financial obligations at all times.
All client cash deposits are repayable on demand.
At 27 September 2009, the Group had access to an overdraft facility of 15 million 2008: 15 million.
As the Group normally deals with the market on cash against document basis, liquidity risk is monitored by daily exception reports of unmatched items past settlement date and managed by the Treasury Department and Credit Control Department, reports are reviewed regularly by the Management Committee.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to liquidity risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
The following are the undiscounted cash flows, with the exception of shares to be issued, of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
Financial instruments and risk management continued IV.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes whether due to internal, people and systems risks or from external events, including legal and financial crime risk but does not include strategic, reputation and business risk.
The objective of the Groups approach to operational risk management is to both control and manage the risk in a cost effective manner consistent with the Groups risk appetite.
Operational risk is monitored and reported via specific committees that report into the Risk Management Committee.
The Group uses the Standardised Approach under Pillar 1 for regulatory purposes and uses the results of its annual risk management and control review process for risk management and Pillar 2 purposes.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 of the Capital Requirements Directive will be published on the Groups website before 31 December 2009 at www.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group oper ates a registered Defined Contribution Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Senior Staff Pension Fund and a registered Defined Benefit Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to members.
The disclosures provided are in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme only.
Pension benefits are related to the members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
Since 1 April 2003 the Scheme has been closed to new members.
Members under age 55 at 1 April 2004 ceased to accrue further service in the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS from that date.
Contributions to the Scheme for the period beginning 28 September 2009 are expected to be 1.3m plus the member contributions for those members still accruing service.
The Group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenditure SORIE.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005 and a further full actuarial valuation is currently in the process of being carried out.
The former has been updated to 27 September 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were in nominal terms as follows: As at As at 27 September 28 September 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.60% 7.00% Rate of salary increase 3.00% 3.60% Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.00% 3.60% Rate of inflation 3.00% 3.60% Average assumed life expectancies for members on retirement at age 65.
Existing pensioners Males 87.4 years 87.0 years Females 88.9 years 89.8 years Future pensioners Males 88.6 years 88.1 years Females 90.0 years 90.9 years In order to determine the expected return on Scheme assets, it is assumed that the returns available on equities will exceed those available from gilts by 3.5% per annum.
This is 1.0% per annum greater than the out-performance allowance used for the funding valuation.
Under IAS 19, the expected return on assets does not affect the surplus deficit to be disclosed but will determine the IAS 19 pension cost for the next accounting period.
