Financial statements Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis From 1 January 2009, the Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating segments.
IFRS 8 replaced IAS 14 Segment reporting.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to assess their performance and to allocate resources to the segments.
These operating segments are then aggregated into reporting segments to combine those with similar characteristics.
In contrast, the predecessor standard required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and rewards approach.
The Group has determined that the chief operating decision maker is the Executive Committee.
Under IFRS 8, the only change for the Group is that the businesses previously reported within the Rest of World segment under IAS 14 are reported within the other segments that best match the characteristics of each individual business.
Comparative information has been restated accordingly.
Emerging markets are those countries in which the Group operates that have started to grow but have yet to reach a mature stage of development and accordingly were in, and are expected to return to, the growth phase of the development cycle.
These currently comprise China, the Balkans, the Baltics, Poland, South America and Africa.
The Groups reported segments are based on the location of the Groups assets.
Revenue earned from sales is disclosed by origin and is not materially different from revenue by destination.
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arms length basis.
Distribution comprises Vertically Integrated Retail businesses as well as Financial Services and other businesses.

The restructuring costs of 5.1m represent the costs of headcount reduction and site closures in Finland, the Baltics and Russia, together with changes in the composition of the Executive Committee.
The charge for restructuring costs in 2008 related to the cost of restructuring the Groups businesses in response to the downturn in the automotive industry and primarily represents the costs of reducing employee headcount and closing less profitable sites.
The vacant property cost of 3.0m represents an onerous lease provision relating to a site occupied by the Inchcape Automotive business that was sold in 2007 and which went into administration in early 2009.
The Group remains responsible for the head lease on this property.
The goodwill impairment charge in 2008 was in respect of the business in Latvia and certain sites in the United Kingdom which have been sold or closed.
The 2009 exceptional tax credit represents a deferred tax credit of 0.9m in respect of the future deduction for overseas redundancy costs in the local territories and a current tax credit of 0.9m in respect of onerous lease costs on UK properties.

com 101 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirements benefits The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its subsidiaries.
The principal schemes are held in the UK and are final salary defined benefit pension schemes.
Most of the schemes have assets held in trust in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
The majority of the overseas defined benefit schemes are final salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement, some of which have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
a. UK schemes The UK has four main defined benefit schemes, namely the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension S cheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
These schemes are considered below: Open schemes Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The majority of the schemes liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners, and the investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of equities and gilts.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2009 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
Whilst a majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners, a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing benefits and the investment strategy reflects this with the majority of the assets invested in equities and bonds.
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the United Kingdom segment in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
A significant majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds.
Closed scheme TKM Group Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2007 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy and the majority of the assets are invested in bonds, cash or gilts.
Approximately half the members are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 5.4m 2008 5.5m.
There are no outstanding contributions to defined contribution schemes at the year end 2008 nil.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported below.
The principal weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries were: United Kingdom Overseas 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 5.2 4.7 4.5 4.6 Rate of increase in pensions 3.7 2.8 Discount rate 5.7 6.2 3.1 1.9 Inflation 3.7 2.8 0.5 0.5 Expected return on plan assets 6.1 6.1 7.0 7.1 102 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Section Three Financial statements 5 Pensions and other post-retirements benefits continued The rate of increase in healthcare cost is 5.5% 2008 5.5% per annum but with higher increases in the first 10 years.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 22.6 years 2008 20.9 years for current pensioners and 25.0 years 2008 22.5 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset principally equities and bonds.
The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities and expected yields on bonds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.

Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
This may be at country, regional or brand level.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segments: 2009 2008 m m United Kingdom 264.6 264.8 Russia and Emerging Markets 216.5 214.8 South Asia 17.9 19.6 Australasia 11.0 9.7 510.0 508.9 Goodwill additions in 2009 arise mainly from adjustments to the purchase price of the Musa Motors group under certain earn out arrangements see note 27.
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 December 2009.
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth decline, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.
These growth rates reflect the long-term growth prospects of the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The growth rates used vary between 0% and 5% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate assumptions are based on an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant CGU.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 12%, and reflect long-term country risk.
The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates in those segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Discount rate Long-term growth rate United Kingdom 11% 2% Russia and Emerging Markets 11% to 12% 5% South Asia 10% 1% Australasia 11% 2% Impairment No impairment charge has been recognised during the year ended 31 December 2009.
In the year ended 31 December 2008, the goodwill in relation to the Groups businesses in Latvia reported in the Russia and Emerging Markets segment was impaired by 46.8m following a significant deterioration in the automotive sector in that market which adversely affected revenue and trading profit.
In addition, goodwill of 7.4m related to sites in the UK which were sold or closed was impaired in 2008.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the long-term growth rates.
With the exception of the Musa Motors group in Russia and the Groups business in Lithuania, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause an impairment in any of the other CGUs.

A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the headroom available to approximately 5% of the carrying value.
The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 10%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would eliminate the headroom available.
Other intangible assets Computer software costs consist of purchase prices from third parties as well as internally generated software development costs.
They include both assets in the course of development and assets in operation.
The amortisation charge is largely included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Other intangible assets include customer contracts and back orders recognised on the acquisition of a business.
These intangible assets are recognised at the fair value attributable to them on acquisition, and are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life usually up to one year.

Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in the US Dollar to Sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
c. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2009, the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities, with the exception of US$75m of debt which was fully repaid during the year.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings and supplier related finance.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings.

com 121 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued d. Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated Financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Hedge of foreign currency operating profit During the year the Group sought to partially hedge the retranslation of the Groups forecast foreign currency operating profit by putting in place 50 currency put options with a total nominal value of 136.3m, at a cost of 8.6m.
The primary objective was to hedge against Sterling appreciating during the year and therefore adversely affecting the retranslation of foreign currency operating profit.
The 50 options were equally split across five currencies, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Euro, Singapore Dollar and US Dollar, with each option hedging one months operating profit.
At the end of the year all contracts had matured and a gain of 0.1m 2008 nil was recognised in the consolidated income statement, net of the option costs.
The nominal principal amount of outstanding contracts at the year end was nil.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than in that units reporting currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with US$475m of the US$550m Private Placement.
The effective portion on the gain or loss of the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
In May 2009, US$114.2m of the US$550m Private Placement was repaid, of which US$75m relates to the net investment hedge of US$ assets.
The remaining US$39m of repaid debt was replaced with a new US$39m cross currency interest rate swap and under IAS 39 the US$475m fair value hedge relationship was fide-designated and re-designated as a US$436m fair value hedge.
A gain of 3.9m was recognised on the fide-designation of the hedge relationship.
In accordance with IAS 39, these hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
The remaining US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swaps are fair valued through the consolidated income statement and therefore not tested for hedge effectiveness.
Net investment hedging Consideration is given to the currency mix of debt with the primary objective that interest on such borrowings acts as a hedge on foreign currency earnings.
In accordance with IAS 39 the Group designated US$75m of the Private Placement as a hedge against US Dollar related assets in Hong Kong, Saipan and Guam.
This relationship was fide-designated in May 2009 when the US$75m of debt designated as a net investment hedge was repaid.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen 2008 Japanese Yen and US Dollar financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.

Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.
The table below shows the credit rating and balances held with major counterparties at the end of the reporting period: 2009 2008 Derivative Derivative assets Cash assets Cash Counterparty m m Credit Rating m m Credit Rating HSBC Bank plc 44 89 AA A-1 122 97 A-1 Lloyds TSB Bank 43 A A-1 89 13 A-1 Royal Bank of Scotland 3 30 A A-1 38 A-1 Fidelity 25 Aaa Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 13 n a 15 n a No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
At 31 December 2009, total derivative asset balances included 90m which was held with three counterparties and total cash balances included 157m which was held with four counterparties.
Total cash balances of 381m include cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Groups broad customer base.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.

Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Refer to the Financial Review on page 39, for discussion of liquidity risks to the Group.

Hedging activities Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: Level 1 Level 2 Total 2009 m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 91.0 91.0 Available for sale financial assets 18.5 18.5 18.5 91.0 109.5 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 21.8 21.8 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted markets prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2009.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swap 84.7 155.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts 6.3 151.3 21.8 91.0 306.9 21.8 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 0.9m 2008 a gain of 2.8m.
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash flow hedges amounts to a gain of 0.6m 2008 0.4m.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedges of net investments.
com 125 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2009 was 587.3m 2008 464.7m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2009 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2009, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes.
Under these swaps the Group receives fixed rate US dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR 85bps and LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place following the US$114.2m repayment of the Private Placement in order to offset the required portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under the new swap the Group pays US dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations Further to the US$114.2m repayment of the Private Placement during the year, US$75m was fide-designated as a hedge of the net investments in Hong Kong, Saipan and Guam which was being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing were transferred to equity, up until the point when the debt was repaid, to offset any gains or losses on translation of net investments in the subsidiaries.
h. Capital management The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
During the year, the Group issued 4,143,316,500 new ordinary shares of 1p each by way of 9 for 1 Rights Issue see note 24.
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
2009 2008 Adjusted EBITA interest cover times 14.0 8.0 Net debt to EBITDA times n a 1.4 Net debt market capitalisation percentage n a 227.7% Calculated as Adjusted EBITA interest on consolidated borrowings Calculated as net debt earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Calculated as net debt market capitalisation as at 31 December 126 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Section Three Financial statements 24 Share capital a.

The issue raised 234.3m net of issue costs of 14.3m.
The structure utilised to facilitate the Rights Issue attracted merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 and as a result the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued was initially recorded as a merger reserve.
Subsequent internal transactions required to complete the Rights Issue resulted in the excess of 192.9m being transferred to retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders.
Prior to the Rights Issue, the nominal value of 25p of each existing ordinary share exceeded the proposed issue price of 6p of each new ordinary share.
As it was not possible for the Company to issue shares at less than their nominal value, the existing shares were subdivided into one new ordinary share of 1p and one deferred share of 24p.
The rights attached to the deferred shares, which are not listed, are limited.
Holders of deferred shares have no voting, dividend or capital distribution rights, save for very limited rights on a winding up.
It is intended that they will be cancelled and an appropriate reserve created in due course.
d. Share buy back programme At 31 December 2009, the Company held 26,875,606 treasury shares 2008 26,875,606 with a total book value of 99.4m 2008 99.4m.
These shares may either be cancelled or used to satisfy share options at a later date.
The Group did not repurchase any of its own shares during the period ended 31 December 2009 2008 4,460,000 shares were purchased on the London Stock Exchange.
In 2008, the total consideration paid was 16.0m and this was deducted from the Retained earnings reserve.
The shares repurchased in 2008 equated to 0.9% of the issued share capital.
e. Substantial shareholdings Details of substantial interests in the Companys issued ordinary share capital received by the Company at 9 March 2010 under the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 have been disclosed in the significant shareholdings section of the Corporate Governance report.
The book value of these shares at 31 December 2009 was 2.1m 2008 0.9m restated for Rights Issue.
The market value of these shares at 31 December 2009 and at 9 March 2010 was 4.1m 31 December 2008 0.9m, 18 March 2009 1.2m.

Translation reserve The translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange rate changes relating to the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries arising after 1 January 2004.
It is also used to record foreign exchange differences arising on long-term foreign currency borrowings used to finance or hedge foreign currency investments.
Hedging reserve For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders equity.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.

Acquisitions In July 2008, the Group acquired 75.1% of the issued share capital of the Musa Motors group for a total cash consideration of US$240m: a US$200m initial downpayment was made in 2008: a further payment of US$35m was made in October 2009: and a final settlement of US$5m is due in 2010.
The remaining 24.9% is to be acquired in early 2011, with payment dependent on 2010 EBITA, capped at US$250m.
During the year, adjustments have been made to the net assets acquired of the Musa Motors group, as permitted by IFRS 3, Business combinations.
These fair value adjustments were not material and therefore prior periods have not been restated.
The changes to the net assets acquired were primarily due to a decrease in amounts due to suppliers and an increase in various taxes when compared to original estimates.
These changes, together with revisions to amounts due in respect of the remaining contingent deferred consideration, have resulted in an increase in the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition of 22.3m.
b. Disposals During the year, the Group disposed of a small number of dealerships and operations generating disposal proceeds of 3.0m 2008 27.3m and a loss on disposal of 0.7m 2008 1.2m which has not been disclosed as an exceptional item.
