Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued The movements during the year were as follows: Intangible assets 11 Exploration and Evaluation Goodwill Assets Total 000 000 000 Cost and net book value: At 1 January 2008 130,850 172,397 303,247 Transfers and reclassifications 26,729 26,729 Exchange adjustments 24,130 11,718 35,848 Additions 105,378 105,378 Unsuccessful exploration and evaluation 29,852 29,852 At 31 December 2008 154,980 232,912 387,892 Exchange adjustments 164 1,421 1,257 Additions 143,480 143,480 Disposals 535 535 Acquisitions 4,428 4,428 Unsuccessful exploration and evaluation 43,253 43,253 At 31 December 2009 159,244 334,025 493,269 Exploration and Evaluation Additions to exploration and evaluation assets represent the ongoing execution of the underlying work programmes and the fulfillment of individual licence requirements.
During the year, following completion of geotechnical evaluation activity, certain licences were either relinquished or are in the process of being relinquished, and were declared unsuccessful.
Accordingly the related licence expenditures were expensed.
During 2009, the principal exploration write-offs were Morocco - Bouanane, Egypt North Qarun, South Fieran, North Ghara and Norway Trolla.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is described more fully in note 28 Acquisition of Subsidiaries, on page 96.
The Group has three reportable segments Europe, Egypt and Other International.
No goodwill has been allocated to Other International and therefore Europe and Egypt are used as cash generating units for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations on an annual basis as they are currently the lowest level that goodwill is reviewed by the Board.
Carrying amount of goodwill of each cash generating unit 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 000 000 Europe 100,616 89,131 Egypt 58,628 65,849 159,244 154,980 Value in use: key assumptions The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit CGU is determined by value in use calculations which measure the net present value at the reporting date of the anticipated cash flow projections from each individual asset which comprise the portfolio underpinning the CGU.
Life of field cash flow projections are used for development and producing assets, applying generally accepted market assumptions for commodity price and future inflation.
For exploration assets a risked valuation is used which combines an assessment of the expected chance of commercial success and likely development cost.
Value attributable to exploration from the Groups extensive exploration portfolio, is derived from two sources: one, being the market value of existing discoveries which have established the presence of hydrocarbons, but where further appraisal activity is required, and the other, being the economic monetary value of the future drilling portfolio taking account of geological risking less the expected pre-tax exploration cost: in both cases, using valuation multiples in line with precedent transactions.
80 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2009 The risk adjusted cash flows are then discounted at 12% Note that Egypt assets are discounted Intangible assets at 8% as pre-tax and post-tax cash flow are the same.
11 continued The calculation of value in use for the CGU is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Commodity price Production volumes Exchange rates Discount rates Operating costs Capital costs Commodity prices reflect a market view of future prices.
Life of field production profiles are estimated for each individual asset within the Group development and production portfolio by the technical management team.
Operating costs and capital costs are estimated using information from either the operator for non-operated assets or the technical management team for operated assets.
The foreign exchange rates used for the calculations were: USD GBP 1.60 NOK GBP 10.00 Euro GBP 1.15 The excess of the recoverable amount of the D&P and E&E assets over the carrying value of each CGU is 1,913.3m for Europe and 111.4m for Egypt.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions There are possible changes to the key assumptions above which might be considered reasonably likely and cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Commodity price the Board has considered the possibility of lower than planned oil and gas prices.
A reduction in oil price to $48.74 per bbl for the Europe CGU and $59.80 per bbl for the Egypt CGU would be required before value in use, as defined above, was reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount.
Production volumes the Board recognises that production profiles may be adjusted at each future reserves estimate review.
An across-the-board reduction of 57% for the Europe CGU and 30% for the Egypt CGU in production would be required before value in use, as defined above, was reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount.
Exchange rates the Board has considered the possibility of a significant movement in exchange rates between GBP and USD.
An exchange rate of $2.68 1 for the Europe CGU and $2.15 1 for the Egypt CGU would be required before value in use, as defined above, was reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount.
