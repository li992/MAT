Notes to the accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The parent company and consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that have been adopted by the European Union EU.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The most significant effect on the financial statements from accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of research and development, and revenue.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key areas where estimates have been used and assumptions applied are in provisions, impairment testing of goodwill and in assessing the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Further information on the Group's business activities, performance and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its capital structure and cash flow are included in the Business Review and Finance Review on pages 10 to 21.
In addition, note 32 to the financial statements discloses details of the Group's financial risk management and credit facilities.
Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements and IFRS 8, Operating segments were adopted in the period.
IAS 1 has resulted in format changes to the primary statements and IFRS 8 has resulted in a change in segmental analysis, which is further described in note 2.
The following adopted IFRS were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these accounts: Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations and IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements The revised standards introduce changes to acquisition accounting, notably in respect of treatment of acquisition costs, step and partial acquisitions, minority interests and contingent consideration.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company's functional currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
Basis of accounting i Subsidiaries The Group accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The accounts include the Group's share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the accounts.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity.
iv Company Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 53 Notes to the accounts continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Foreign currency i On consolidation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to a seperate translation reserve within equity.
They are recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation.
In respect of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented as a separate component of equity.
ii Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates fair value was determined.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The associated gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which the transaction to which it relates occurs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in a separate translation reserve within equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The principal rates are as follows: Freehold buildings 1.5% Office furniture and fittings 10% Motor vehicles 20% Plant and machinery 10 - 12.5% Office equipment 12.5 - 33.3% Tooling and patterns 10% The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK GAAP.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research and development is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred except that, development expenditure is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or substantially improved products that are subsequently to be released for sale and will generate future economic benefits.
The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related expenses.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
iii Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
54 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date they are available for use.
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually.
The principal amortisation rates are as follows: Capitalised development costs 20% Manufacturing designs and ERP systems and software 12.5 - 20% core technology 10% Customer relationships 20% Non compete undertaking 50% Brand names and trademarks 10 - 20% Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including overheads where appropriate, and estimated net realisable value.
Provision is made for slow-moving and obsolete items based on an assessment of technological and market developments and on an analysis of usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the of cash flow statements.
Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees' services.
The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations to determine its present value.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year they arise.
Any scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit is recognised in full in the balance sheet.
The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the period which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees' services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
iii Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes.
The fair value of these options and awards at their date of grant is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
iv Long term share incentive plans The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the cost spread over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based performance conditions.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from projects or service contracts is recognised as income in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed depending on the specific circumstances of each case.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs, or there is the possibility of return of the goods.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with the goods.
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or service contract.
An expected loss on a project or service contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Leases i Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
ii Finance leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of the liability.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 55 Notes to the accounts continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Taxation The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax expense is recognised in the Income Statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, when it is also recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the accounts.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Share options granted to subsidiary employees The Parent company grants share options over its own ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies.
These employees provide services to the subsidiary companies.
The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value of the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiary companies.
This is accounted for as an increase in investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable component of equity.
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING As a result of the introduction of IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which introduced a management approach to segment reporting, the Group's segments have been changed to disclose information that is more consistent with management reporting.
All 2008 figures previously presented in old segmental format have been restated to reflect the new presentation.

These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year which has been approved by the Board and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed annual forecasts.
The key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
Pre-tax discount rates range from 13-25%.
Growth rates vary between 1-5% depending on detailed forecasts.
These rates of growth are conservative when compared to the annualised profit growth of the group over the last few years.
No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
The principal value in use assumptions for the Flexicon A S Denmark goodwill balance were as follows: Annual monetary growth of 5%.
The principal value in use assumptions for the MasoSine goodwill balance were as follows: Long term revenue growth of 2.5-3.5%.
As expected there is little headroom in the case of recently acquired businesses, which have not yet had time to develop under the management of the Group.
The businesses are performing in accordance with expectations and the key assumptions used above are appropriate at the year-end.
As an indication of the headroom limits, the impairment charge that would be required if the discount rate were increased by 1% is 900,000 and that required if long-term revenue growth were decreased by 1% is 700,000.

28 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension plans - The Group The Group is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Groups Defined Benefit Obligations.
Other plans operated by the Group were either Defined Contribution plans or were deemed immaterial for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
The total expense relating to the Groups Defined Contribution pension plans in the current year was 5,215,000 2008: 4,485,000.
Of the Defined Benefit plans, the plans in the UK and USA hold most of the liability.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of these plans may therefore be considered material.
The UK schemes assume that post-retirement mortality follows the PA00 series tables, with medium cohort improvements subject to minimum improvements of 1% per annum, and depending on a member's year of birth.
An adjustment is then made for each plan to reflect the profile of membership.
This basis gives a life expectancy of 20 years and 22 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.
These figures reflect the generally recognised trend of increased longevity.
The USA schemes use the RP-2000 mortality table with AA scale projected through 2010.
Life expectancy under this table is 19 years and 21 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.
These assumptions are regularly reviewed in light of scheme specific experience and more widely available statistics.
The financial assumptions used at 31st December were: Assumptions weighted by value of liabilities % per annum UK pensions Overseas pensions and medical 2009 2008 2009 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 4.1 3.5 3.7 Rate of increase in pensions 3.4 3.1 1.8 2.0 Rate of price inflation 3.5 3.0 2.6 2.7 Discount rate 5.7 6.3 5.6 6.2 Medical trend rate 5.0 5.0 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective is to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted from 1995 to 2001 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 6% greater than the increase in the UK retail prices index over a consecutive three year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From and including the 2002 options the increase in EPS was revised to 9% greater than the increase in the UK retail price index over a three year consecutive period and from 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured by Towers Watson LLP, Actuaries and Consultants, using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.
The relevant disclosures in respect of the share option scheme grants are set out below.
b Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to executive directors and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
For awards granted up to 2007 the performance target is based on the Company's total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Company's TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Company's TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Company's TSR is below the median.
The performance criteria for awards from 2008 onwards are split into two separate parts.
The vesting of the first part, amounting to 60% of the award, is based on the existing TSR measure.
The vesting of the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three year performance period.
25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to 5% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 11%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these two rates.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued by Towers Watson using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology.

The aim of the Plan is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions.
Employees are invited to join the Plan when an offer is made each year.
Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules.
The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by the individual.

76 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 32 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000. Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and it's customer base is varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers' credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non collectable.
Historically losses from trade receivables have been low.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing depending on which gives best value.
Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit's functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1m per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than twelve months in advance or for more than 80% of the forecast exposure.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31st December was as follows: 2008 THE GROUP Fixed rate Floating rate Financial liabilities financial financial on which no Total liabilities liabilities interest is paid 000 000 000 000 Euro 21,696 1,003 20,693 US dollar 17,261 15,267 1,994 Other 47,514 1,133 19,347 27,034 86,471 2,136 34,614 49,721 2009 THE GROUP Fixed rate Floating rate Financial liabilities financial financial on which no Total liabilities liabilities interest is paid 000 000 000 000 Euro 35,163 748 17,766 16,649 US dollar 14,518 12,422 2,096 Other 52,533 3,995 19,230 29,308 102,214 4,743 49,418 48,053 In respect of fixed rate financial liabilities the interest rate for euro financial liabilities is 1% fixed for 0.1 years.
The interest rate for Korean Won financial liabilities is 4.9% fixed for 0.4 years, and the interest rate for Chinese RMB financial liabilities is 4.9% fixed for 0.9 years.

Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates.
The average rate of interest received on sterling deposits during the year was 0.33% 2008: 3.7%.
Currency exposures As explained above, the Group's objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating or 'functional' currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary liability of 372,000 2008: 3,000 and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 2,441,000 2008: 1,015,000.
At 31st December the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 22.5% 2008: 1% for the euro and 34.6% 2008: 38% for the US dollar.
Maturity of financial liabilities The Group's financial liabilities at 31st December reprice or mature if earlier in the following periods: 2008 THE GROUP Trade and Short term Finance Long term other payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 In six months or less, or on demand 49,721 2,045 8,498 28 25,311 85,603 In more than six months but no more than twelve 510 58 568 In more than one year but no more than two 69 69 In more than two years but no more than three 68 68 In more than three years but no more than four 71 71 In more than four years but no more than five 73 73 In more than five years 19 19 49,721 2,045 9,008 386 25,311 86,471 2009 THE GROUP Trade and Short term Finance Long term other payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 In six months or less, or on demand 48,053 559 5,123 9 44,034 97,778 In more than six months but no more than twelve 4,161 54 4,215 In more than one year but no more than two 76 76 In more than two years but no more than three 61 61 In more than three years but no more than four 65 65 In more than four years but no more than five 19 19 In more than five years 48,053 559 9,284 284 44,034 102,214 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 79 Notes to the accounts continued 32 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued 2008 THE PARENT Trade and Short term Finance Long term other payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 In six months or less, or on demand 256 256 256 256 2009 THE PARENT Trade and Short term Finance Long term other payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 In six months or less, or on demand 318 318 318 318 Cash flow hedge At 31st December the Group had contracts outstanding to purchase 1,200,000 with South Korean won, 1,080,000 with Japanese yen, 132,000 with US dollars, 183,000 with US dollars, 6,688,000 with Euros, $63,000 with Swedish SEK, 373,500 with Danish DKK, 617,000 with Norwegian NOK, 694,000 with South African Rand, 600,000 with Chinese RMB, 270,000 with Swedish SEK, 322,100 with Czech CZK, 400,000 Polish PLN and 120,000 with Chinese RMB.
Borrowing Facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: THE GROUP 2009 2008 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 28,597 32,486 THE PARENT 2009 2008 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 20,000 20,000 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year end exchange rates.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31st December, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 50,000 2008: 120,000.
At the year end borrowings totalled 54,161,000 consequently, in respect of financial liabilities, the Group is not significantly at risk from increases in interest rates.
80 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 For the year ended 31st December 2009, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Group's profit and trading flows has increased the Group's profit before tax by approximately 1,200,000 2008: 1,000,000.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
The credit risk profile of trade receivables The aging of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2009 2009 2008 2008 Not past due date 97,447 271 97,608 310 0-30 days past due date 10,904 239 15,588 390 30 days-1 year past due date 15,434 4,440 14,704 2,605 More than one year 3,171 3,171 2,778 2,778 126,956 8,121 130,678 6,083 Based on past experience the Group believes no further impairment allowance is required for receivables that are past their due date.
Adjusted operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share exclude the amortisation and impairment of aquired intangibles.
excluding non-operating items including non-operating items Return on capital employed prior to 2007 is based on operating profit excluding non-operating items and amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and average net assets excluding net goodwill and net debt.
