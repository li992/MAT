113 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 22 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Litigation John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
An adverse judgment at first instance from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois is currently under appeal.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has begun to meet defence costs directly.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufficiently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
JCI is actively monitoring the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist all asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 168,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 30 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 129,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 82 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$82m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs and, whilst the number of claims being filed against JCI and other defendants has been declining, the proportion of mesothelioma claims has increased, and JCIs ability to defend these cases is likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: The periods over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated.
Projections used range between 10 and 18 years.
The future trend of legal costs, allowing for 3% cost inflation.
The rate of future claims filed.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average amount of judgments awarded.
The provision is based on past history and allows for decreasing costs based on published tables of asbestos incidence projections.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 2009 2008 m m Gross provision 213.3 185.9 Discount 46.7 47.0 Discounted pre-tax provision 166.6 138.9 Deferred tax 45.0 37.5 Discounted post-tax provision 121.6 101.4 Other litigation The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement, and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provision is made for the expected fees and associated costs, based on professional advice as to the likely duration of each case.
Provisions totalling 10.5m 2008: 2.2m were released relating to litigation settled at less than the expected cost.
Apart from that relating to JCI, none of the other provisions is discounted.
