The Company's auditors received fees of 730,000 in connection with acquisitions completed during the year.
These costs have been capitalised together with other acquisition costs.
Fees paid to the Company's auditors KPMG Audit Plc, and its associates for services other than the statutory audit of the Company are not disclosed since the consolidated accounts disclose non-audit fees on a consolidated basis.
Details of directors remuneration are given in the Remuneration report on pages 41 to 50.
3 Net fair value gains losses on assets at fair value through income 2009 2008 '000 '000 Fair value gains losses on investments 2,881 2,505 The above fair value adjustment represents gains and losses, both realised and unrealised, on financial assets held for trading which have been recognised in revenue.
78 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 4 Other operating income 2009 2008 '000 '000 Other operating income comprises the following items: Exceptional gain on disposal of property 4,129 Losses gains on disposal of other investments 282 724 Other operating income 282 4,853 2009 The loss on disposal of other investments comprise net gains of 48,000 on the disposal of private equity investments, together with net losses of 330,000 on the disposal of investments held by the property asset management division.
2008 The gain on disposal of property related to the sale of a building acquired as part of the DEGI transaction.
The premium over the fair value on acquisition was achieved as a result of subsequent changes in the tenancy arrangements of the property and in the identification of a strategic purchaser.
The Board considered this gain to be outwith the course of the Groups normal business and sufficiently material that it should be disclosed separately to enable a proper understanding of the financial statements and therefore chose to disclose this item as an exceptional gain.
The gain on disposal of other investments comprises principally net gains realised on the disposal of private equity investments.
5 Exceptional costs Exceptional costs incurred in 2009 fall into three categories.
First the costs arising from the acquisition of certain businesses and assets from Credit Suisse and the integration and migration of these businesses of the Group.
These integration costs include charges in respect of a transitional services agreement with the vendor to ensure that both people and systems were transferred in a controlled manner: set up costs in respect of the migration of the back office data and systems to the Groups third party administrator: and costs of retaining duplicate staffing for a transitional period to ensure a smooth migration of data.
Secondly, non-recurring rationalisation and redundancy costs have been incurred in implementing a cost reduction programme.
Finally, one-off costs have been incurred in completing the integration of businesses acquired during the previous financial year.
These costs include the acceleration of certain property lease costs following the elimination of duplication of office premises as well as redundancy and other rationalisation costs.
The exceptional provision for vAT on investment trusts in 2008 represents vAT which may be repayable to the Groups UK investment trust clients following conclusion of an action brought against HMRC by a UK investment trust.
The amount of this provision is an estimate of the costs which may arise in respect of historic periods in excess of the amount to be recovered from HMRC.
The exceptional impairment provision in 2008 arose from the decision to discontinue marketing a proposed property fund in order to focus attention on completion and integration of the DEGI transaction.
As a result of this decision, the fair value of this fund was considered to be impaired because of the accelerated recognition of future costs arising from this portfolio.

84 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 12 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude exceptional items and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of exceptional and non-cash items.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the most appropriate CGU.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to each segment is as follows: Group Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 '000 '000 '000 '000 Investment management 937,192 623,295 306,488 26,682 Property asset management 210,422 205,166 1,147,614 828,461 306,488 26,682 Goodwill Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of various businesses over the years and is separately identifiable into the two business segments described above.
These business segments represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and tested for impairment.
Additions to goodwill during the year relate to the businesses acquired from Credit Suisse as described in note 15.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing, as described below.
There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded at 30 September 2009.
Management contracts Management contracts arise on business combinations and as with goodwill they are allocated to the appropriate CGUs.
They are recorded initially at their fair value and then amortised, unless in the case of open end funds they are deemed to have an indefinite life.
Where contracts do not have an indefinite life they are being amortised over their remaining useful lives of between two and ten years.
The group tests for impairment of these assets annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Details of the impairment review in respect of the current year are described below.
Additions to management contracts during the year relate to the businesses acquired from Credit Suisse as described in note 15.
Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles Goodwill The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use cash flow projections based on the Group's latest approved budgets covering the 2009 10 financial year and which take into account the market conditions prevailing at the time.
value in use has been estimated by using a discounted cashflow model, on the basis of a five year projection plus a terminal value as required by IAS 36.
The cash flows have been based on the annual budget for the year to 30 September 2010, as approved by the Board with a long term growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows from the budget.
This long term growth rate assumption is in line with the long term nature of the Group's business and in line with the Board's view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long term.
The principal assumptions used in the above analysis are: 2009 2008 % % Annual increase in equity assets under management AuM 6.0 6.0 Annual increase in fixed income assets under management AuM 3.0 3.0 Annual increase in property under management AuM 6.0 6.0 Annual increase in operating costs Investment management 5.5 3.0 Annual increase in operating costs Property asset management 5.0 3.0 The annual increases in operating costs assumed above, include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increase in the levels of business.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 87 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 13 Intangible assets continued The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital using a risk fee interest rate, together with a beta for the sector and allied to an equity risk premium.
The rates calculated for each CGU, which take into account the relative risks associated with each CGU, are as follows: 2009 2009 2008 Post tax Pre tax Post tax % % % Investment management 10.3 13.3 10.5 Property asset management 12.8 16.7 14.0 The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The sensitivity analysis included testing assumptions relating to future revenue growth and the assumptions surrounding the level of operating costs and margins.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were: 2009 2009 2008 2008 Investment Property asset Investment Property asset management management management management % % % % Discount rate 16.2 16.3 13.0 21.2 Long term revenue growth rate 0.5 4.0 4.5 3.9 Inflation rate 12.7 7.5 6.7 7.4 The value in use, calculated for each CGU in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment.
This comparison resulted in a surplus of value in use over the carrying value of these assets for both CGUs, as shown in the table below, and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.
2009 2009 2008 2008 Investment Property asset Investment Property asset management management management management 000 000 000 000 Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 694,000 49,000 524,000 207,000 Management contracts IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets' requires impairment testing to be carried out if indicators of potential impairment exist.
The Group reviewed the management contracts held at 30 September 2009 including contracts which are considered to have an indefinite life.
Management contracts within investment management at 30 September 2009 includes 294.6 million 2008: 119.0 million of assets which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The review revealed potential indicators of impairment in respect of a small number of indefinite life contracts.
value in use calculations were performed in respect of these contracts using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill.
Estimates of fair value less costs to sell were also prepared and both measures of value were compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
This revealed a deficit in the carrying value compared to the fair value less costs to sell of 12.7 million which has been recognised as an impairment cost in the year to 30 September 2009.
88 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 13 Intangible assets continued The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2009 30 September 2008 Net book Remaining Estimated Net book Remaining Estimated values amortisation useful life values amortisation useful life '000 period years years '000 period years years Institutional contracts - equities & fixed income 69,530 38 610 72,475 47 610 Institutional contracts - property 24,561 38 610 28,704 49 610 Open end fund contracts 369,815 N A Indefinite 187,711 N A Indefinite 463,906 288,890 Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as described above in respect of the Groups intangible assets.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
Disposals during the year comprised 2.4 million of seed capital investments within the property division, 2.4 million of seed capital within the investment management division and 1.7 million of private equity investments.
On 1 July 2008 the Group reclassified 7.6 million of investments in equity securities previously classified as current assets held for trading to non-current assets available for sale.
This is in line with the changes to International Accounting Standards IAS 39 which permits such changes in rare circumstances.
The Group regarded the turmoil in global financial markets during 2008 as a once in a generation event which meets the definition of rare circumstance.
The fair value of these assets at 30 September 2009 is 4.8 million 2008: 6.4 million.
The cumulative movement in fair value since reclassification of 1.4 million 2008: 1.2 million has been taken to fair value reserve.

Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 109 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 29 Financial instruments continued Foreign net investment The majority of the Groups subsidiaries use sterling as their functional and presentation currency.
The foreign currency net monetary assets of subsidiaries which adopt a different reporting currency are as follows: 2009 2008 '000 '000 US dollar 23,300 13,459 Singapore dollar 3,751 63,162 Australian dollar 23,883 6,195 Nordic currencies 86,553 75,662 Euro 18,580 14,480 Other 15,316 11,218 Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Groups life assurance subsidiaries provide unit linked wrappers which avail clients of a number of benefits from these pooled arrangements.
From the Groups perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to these assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from these entities which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity these Group subsidiary companies have some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The unit linked assets are matched by the associated insurance contract liabilities disclosed in note 19.
The assets above are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited and Aberdeen Asset Management Pooled Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.
30 Provisions Provision for Investment Trust vAT Group '000 Current liabilities At 1 October 2008 2,000 Utilised in the year 700 At 30 September 2009 1,300 Following a successful action against HM Revenues and Customs HMRC brought jointly by the Association of Investment Companies and a UK investment trust, management fees charged to UK investment trusts were deemed to be exempt from vAT.
As a result, a number of the Group's UK subsidiaries are in course of seeking repayment of overpaid vAT from HMRC and reimbursing their investment trust clients accordingly.
Although the Group always complied with vAT legislation in place at the relevant time, the amounts to be repaid to investment trusts will exceed the amounts recovered from HMRC, and provision was made in 2008 for the expected excess costs.
During the year net payments of 700,000 were made by the Group.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.

While there can be no assurances, the directors believe, based on information currently available to them, that the likelihood of a material outflow of economic benefits is remote.
37 Financial risk management Overview The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks is provided in this note, which describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Groups risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the Board's policies are handled by the Groups risk management committee.
The Groups audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Debt levels are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 119 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 37 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group prepares regular cashflow forecasts for the Board and management board and monitors cash movements closely in order to manage each resource efficiently.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest on the Groups borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily Sterling, Euro and US dollars.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
The Groups investment in its US subsidiary is hedged by the Groups US dollar 7.2% subordinated notes 2016, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the subsidiary's net assets.
The Groups investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged as those currency positions are considered to be long-term in nature.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement.
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities.
These securities are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the Group management board.
Unit-linked assets The Groups balance sheet contains a significant level of assets relating to the Groups life and pensions subsidiary for which the risks and rewards fall to the benefit of or are borne by the underlying policyholders.
Therefore the investment contract liabilities shown in the Groups balance sheet are equal and opposite in value to the assets held on behalf of the policyholders.
As a result the Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of assets which are held on behalf of policyholders.
The Groups exposure in relation to these assets lies in the revenue earned from the assets which varies in line with the movement in value of the assets.
The Group has no exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default.
Stock of units and shares These represent units and shares of open end investment companies OEICs which are operated and managed by the Group.
These are funds into which both institutional and retail investors can invest and the Group maintains a stock of units and shares in these funds, in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management committee has set specific limits for the overall value of units which can be held by the Group at any one time and also placed a limit on the value of units held in any single fund.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
The majority of the Groups asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values except performance fees which typically are earned based on annual performance.
Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
As a result, the average level for debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, will represent approximately four months revenue.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
very few clients have external credit ratings.
Open end fund debtors The Group operates and manages a number of OEIC's and in doing so it seeks, as far as possible, to match the purchase and sale of investments in order to match the receipt or payment of funds from or to clients.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
120 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37 Financial risk management continued Cash and cash equivalents The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Groups risk management policy which is designed to manage the risks associated with the Groups cash and cash equivalent assets.
The treasury function for the Group is managed on a daily basis by the Group finance department who manage the Groups cash resources within guidelines set by the board who receive regular reports on both the treasury and regulatory positions for the Group.
The main parameters within which the treasury function operates include: Cash placed on deposit Deposits are only placed with approved counterparties Foreign currency risk is managed in order to minimize, where possible, the risk of movement in exchange rates.
This involves the repatriation of cash held by overseas subsidiaries to Sterling and this is achieved by way of dividends from subsidiaries as well as the settlement of intercompany transfer pricing arrangements.
Cash placed on deposit may be subject to changes in interest rates and the Group manages its deposits to maximise the returns but at the same time ensuring that the Groups working capital requirements can be met.
Management of capital The Board's policy with respect to capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to provide a sufficient base to sustain the future development of the business, while at the same time ensuring compliance with regulatory capital requirements.
The Company's ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Board monitors the composition of the shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in the share capital of the Company are provided in the Directors' report on page 38.
Movements in share capital during the year which include new shares issued to finance acquisitions are provided in note 24.
The Board gives careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for each acquisition which in the past have been structured to include both debt and equity funding.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share-based payment schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Group management board.
Working capital The Group monitors the level of its working capital closely to ensure that it has sufficient cash available to meet its liabilities as they become due.
In addition, the Groups treasury function monitors cash balances on a daily basis.
Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital as prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
The Group has been granted a waiver obtained from the FSA from the requirement to meet the minimum capital requirement under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver has been in place since 1 December 2007 and is currently effective until 31 December 2011.
At 30 September 2009 there were 40 regulated companies in the Group, ten of which are registered in the United Kingdom and are regulated by the FSA.
With the exception of Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited and Aberdeen Asset Management Pooled Pensions Limited, which are regulated insurance firms, all others are regulated investment firms.
Only the regulated investment firms are part of the Group consolidation for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
The Group has 30 overseas regulated companies all of which are subject to regulatory capital requirements which are determined by their local regulator.
The measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resource Requirements CRR, which are referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD, are set out in regulatory rules.
The CRR for UK regulated investment firms is the higher of: the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 121 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 37 Financial risk management continued The credit risk relates to the risk of a third party becoming unable to meet its obligations to a firm.
The risk is calculated by using risk weighted percentages which are applied to the various exposure amounts.
Market risk represents the risk of a loss being incurred from fluctuations in exchange rates, calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firm's relevant fixed annual expenditure in the year's audited financial statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit returns quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The Group is required, as part of the CRD, to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing on major risks, considering how the firm would cope with a significant market downturn for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
All the regulated companies in the Group maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout the year.
38 Analysis of risks arising from financial instruments This note presents a numerical analysis of the Groups exposure to financial risk, as described in note 37.
The Groups direct and indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital resources are described in note 37.
Disclosures relating to policyholder unit linked assets and liabilities in respect of the Groups life and pensions subsidiary have been excluded from this analysis as the risks and rewards from these assets and liabilities rest with the policyholders.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should, however, be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome, particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: Sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% Market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% Fair values of investments are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% at each reporting date The impact of the assumptions on the risk variables, net of tax, are as follows: Group Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2009 000 000 000 000 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US$ exchange rates 405 405 6,083 6,083 Sterling Euro 82 82 690 690 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Investments Sterling equity prices 1,197 1,197 1,996 1,996 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 776 776 776 776 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2008 000 000 000 000 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US$ exchange rates 364 364 4,906 4,906 Sterling Euro 4,104 4,104 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Investments Sterling equity prices 1,271 1,271 2,083 2,083 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 264 264 264 264 130 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38 Analysis of risks arising from financial instruments continued Company Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2009 000 000 000 000 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US$ exchange rates 405 405 7,724 7,724 Sterling Euro 82 82 2,672 2,672 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Investments Sterling equity prices 823 823 1,647 1,647 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1,725 1,725 1,725 1,725 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2008 000 000 000 000 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US$ exchange rates 364 364 5,501 5,501 Sterling Euro 3 3 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Investments Sterling equity prices 857 857 1,669 1,669 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1,078 1,078 1,078 1,078 39 Post balance sheet event On 16 October 2009, the Company agreed terms for the issue of 3.5% senior unsecured convertible bonds 2014.
