com 71 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 373,831,805 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares 2008: 372,769,853.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 374,893,326 shares 2008: 374,604,505, which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of 1,061,521 2008: 1,834,652.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Earnings from continuing operations exclude the net profit from discontinued operations.
Adjusted earnings is calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represents a more consistent measure of underlying performance.

Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Infrastructure Sensors Fire Detection 11,363 9,632 Security Sensors 15,795 15,795 Automatic Door Sensors 47,537 40,747 Elevator Safety 9,706 8,129 84,401 74,303 Health and Analysis Water 7,972 7,552 Photonics 43,889 29,059 Health Optics 30,142 22,492 Fluid Technology 7,142 5,186 89,145 64,289 Industrial Safety Bursting Disks 8,100 5,820 Safety Interlocks 5,806 5,172 Asset Monitoring 10,632 11,646 24,538 22,638 198,084 161,230 Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at the Groups pre-tax estimated short term discount rate to calculate their net present value.
76 Halma p. l. c. Annual report and accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12 Goodwill continued Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions, which are the same for all CGUs: Discount rates: Market share during the budget period for the financial year to March 2010: and Growth rate used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
Discount rates are based on the Groups borrowing and equity profile.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present discount rate of 10.25%.
The discount rate of 10.25%, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted average cost of capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Market share assumptions are important because, as well as the growth rates as noted below, management assess how each units relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period.
Management expects each units position to be stable over the projected period.
Growth rate estimates of 3.25% for first year not covered by the budget and 2% thereafter, are based on conservative estimates keeping in view past growth performance.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

Share option plans The Group has issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under three share option plans, approved by shareholders in 1990, 1996 and 1999.
These share option plans provide for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to performance criteria.
Section A options are exercisable after three years if the Groups earnings per share growth exceeds, for the 1990 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index, for the 1996 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 2% per annum and, for the 1999 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum.
Section B options are exercisable after five years if the Companys earnings per share growth exceeds the earnings per share of, for the 1990 and 1996 Plans, all but the top quarter of companies which were within the FTSE 100 at the date of grant of any option and for the 1999 Plan, all but the top quarter of companies which were within a peer group at the date of grant of any option.
All options lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
No further awards have been made under the Company share option plans since 3 August 2005.
Options in respect of 616,000 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 28 March 2009 under the 1996 Plan.

Company from which assets acquired Date of acquisition Country of incorporation Principal activity Consideration excluding costs Fiberguide Industries, Inc September 2008 USA Health and Analysis $14m Oerlikon Optics USA, Inc November 2008 USA Health and Analysis $6m Together these acquisitions contributed 5,531,000 of revenue and 567,000 of profit before tax and amortisation of acquired intangible assets to the Group results for the year ended 28 March 2009.
If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue would have been 4,030,000 higher and profit before tax and amortisation of acquired intangible assets 233,000 higher.
Adjustments were made to the book value of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair value to the Group.
Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading were recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies were aligned with the Group where appropriate.
The adjustment to goodwill arising on prior period acquisitions relates mainly to additional fair value adjustments on the acquisition of PP Medizintechnik GmbH and its subsidiaries including Rudolf Riester GmbH & Co. KG and a revision to the estimated deferred purchase consideration on the acquisition of Tritech International System Technologies.

com 85 Notes to the accounts continued 26 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
Policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currency.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and the net exposure hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and Europe, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Liquidity risk The main source of long-term funding for the Group is its unsecured revolving credit facility for 165 million, which is a five-year facility to February 2013, with a small syndicate of its principal bankers.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 185,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a 210,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 28 March 2009.
Transactional exposures The Groups has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar and are minimal as Group policy is for all foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 8,100,000 at 28 March 2009 2008: 3,166,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 6,980,000 2008: 2,946,000, and Euro and other currency deposits of 1,120,000 2008: 220,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 26,887,000 2008: 24,952,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations are bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 86,173,000 at 29 March 2008 2008: 72,394,000.
All bear interest at floating rates or fixed rates where the period of the fix is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on LIBOR plus a small margin.
These comprise Sterling bank loans of nil 2008:9,000,000, US Dollar denominated bank loans of 39,182,000 2008: 23,116,000 which bear interest with reference to the US Dollar LIBOR rates, and Euro denominated bank loans of 46,991,000 2008: 40,278,000 which bear interest with reference to the Euro LIBOR rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the deferred purchase consideration, other payables and borrowings due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of deferred purchase consideration due after one year includes 13,000 2008: 67,000 due between one and two years, with the balance of 43,000 2008: 40,000 due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,721,000 2008: 1,000,000 due between one and two years, 817,000 2008: 1,299,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 1,138,000 2008: 468,000 due after more than five years.
Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year 165 million revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2013.
Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
86 Halma p. l. c. Annual report and accounts 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 Financial instruments continued The Groups undrawn committed facilities available at 28 March 2009 were 97,009,000 2008: 105,872,000 of which 11,622,000 2008: 6,230,000 mature within one year and 85,387,000 2008: 99,642,000 between two and five years.
UK companies have cross-guaranteed 21,023,000 2008: 19,658,000 of overdraft facilities of which 242,000 2008: 73,000 was drawn.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 28 March 2009 there was no significant difference between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Hedging As explained above, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at cost, which is typically nil, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which all mature within one year: Average Exchange Rate Foreign Currency Contract Value Fair Value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 US Dollars 1.43 1.98 5,131 5,051 3,578 2,550 11 11 Euros 1.10 1.31 9,422 10,069 8,535 7,680 189 311 Other currencies 1,957 1,928 69 62 14,070 12,158 269 238 With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar, profits would decrease by 1,696,000 2008: 1,425,000 and by 10% against the Euro by 1,930,000 2008: 1,408,000.
The sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups sensitivity has increased to both the US Dollar and Euro because more of the Groups profits are earned in these currencies.
27 Commitments Capital commitments Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 28 March 2009 but not provided in these accounts amounts to 1,841,000 2008: 1,469,000.
Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between 2 May 2009 and 22 May 2019 and the latter between 3 April 2009 and 31 December 2015.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
com 87 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002 03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit plans are carried out every three years.
The Halma Group Pension Plan was last assessed as at 1 December 2005, and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan as at 1 April 2006, using the projected unit method.
At those dates the market value of the plan assets were 71.5 million for the Halma Group Pension Plan and 13.8 million for the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 60% and 59% respectively of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
These shortfalls are being addressed by increased company contributions.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 2,388,000 2008: 2,016,000.
Defined benefit schemes The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities are: 2009 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.45% 4.75% 4.25% Rate of increase of pensions in payment pre-April 1997 3.20% 3.50% 3.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment post-April 1997 3.20% 3.50% 3.00% Discount rate 6.40% 5.85% 5.25% Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.50% 3.00% Mortality assumption Halma pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort Mortality assumption Halma non-pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort Mortality assumption Apollo pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort plus one year plus one year plus one year Mortality assumption Apollo non-pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort plus one year plus one year plus one year If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater in the defined benefit plans, the gross deficit would have increased by approximately 3 million: a 0.1% change in the discount rate used to value liabilities would have an approximate effect of 3 million.
The expected rates of return and the net deficit in the plans were: 2009 2008 Expected rate Expected of return Fair value rate of return Fair value % 000 % 000 Equities 7.50 57,407 7.50 76,753 Bonds 6.00 28,880 5.85 29,742 Property 7.50 3,524 6.00 3,540 Total fair value of assets 6.80 89,811 7.01 110,035 Present value of plan liabilities 132,379 145,992 Net deficit 42,568 35,957 The fair value of plan assets includes nil of Halma p. l. c. 10p ordinary shares 2008: 101,525 and a receivable of 1,103,000 2008: 2,087,000 in respect of pension plan liabilities that Halma p. l. c. has assumed on discontinued UK operations.
