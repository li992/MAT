On 6 December 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of HedgeStreet Inc. HedgeStreet for a consideration of 3,024,000 $6,000,000 satisfied in cash.
Goodwill of 3,829,000 arose on the acquisition of HedgeStreet relating to certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured and includes the future growth potential of the business.
There has not been an amendment to the fair value of the acquired assets or consideration paid in the year ended 31 May 2009 in relation to this acquisition.
On 21 June 2009, HedgeStreet Inc. changed its name to North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc. 15b Acquisition of FXOnline Japan KK On 2 October 2008, the Group acquired 87.5% of the issued share capital of FXOnline Japan KK FXOnline, a leading privately-owned Japanese online retail FX trading company, for a total consideration of 22.2 billion 117.6 million.
The Group also has a call option to acquire the remaining 12.5% of the issued share capital exercisable from January 2011 according to a pre-agreed formula that is linked to the future performance of FXOnline.
The entire consideration was satisfied in cash, which was in part financed by a share placing of 27,864,407 shares at a placing price of 2.95 raising 82.2 million.
FXOnline contributed 22.6 million to revenue and 9.2 million to profit before tax excluding 5.4 million of synergies generated post acquisition.
If the combination had been completed on the first day of the financial period, the estimated revenue would have been 33.4 million with profit before tax of 9.6 million for the year, excluding 5.4 million of synergies generated post acquisition.
A number of exceptional costs were incurred pre acquisition reducing profit for the year.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 74 Notes to the Financial Statements 15.
Investment in subsidiaries continued 15b Acquisition of FXOnline Japan KK continued The book and fair value of the assets acquired is given below.
Book value Fair value Net assets acquired 000 000 Intangible assets arising on acquisition trade name 778 Intangible assets arising on acquisition customer relationships 42,691 Property, plant and equipment 1,489 1,489 Intangible assets software and licences 429 429 Deferred tax assets 1,719 1,719 Trade receivables 14,251 14,251 Other receivables 485 485 Cash and cash equivalents 68,202 68,202 Trade payables 65,341 65,341 Other payables 6,456 6,456 Corporate tax liabilities 2,555 2,555 Deferred tax liability 18,257 12,223 37,435 Goodwill 87,121 Consideration and minority interests 124,556 Represented by: Cash 117,612 Deferred contingent consideration 1,385 Acquisition costs capitalised, settled in cash 4,031 Minority interests 1,528 124,556 The fair value adjustments include the recognition of separately identifiable intangible assets arising on acquisition that meet the identification and measurement requirements of IAS 38.
These comprise the FXOnline trade name and customer relationships and are amortised using the sum of digits method over two and five years respectively.
The fair value of these assets was determined by an external, professional valuer through an estimate of the present value of earnings or of costs avoided that are attributable to the asset the relief from royalties and the multi period excess earnings methods respectively.
A deferred tax liability of 18.3 million was recognised in respect of separately identifiable intangible assets arising on the acquisition of FXOnline.
A deferred tax liability is recognised in a business combination in respect of any identified intangible asset representing the difference between the fair value of the acquired asset and its tax base.
Recognition of a deferred tax liability in respect of such a difference gives rise to a corresponding increase in goodwill accounted for in the consolidated balance sheet.
The deferred tax liability of 18.3 million decreased from the date of acquisition to the end of the period by 1.5 million 6.1 million reduction as a result of the amortisation of the underlying intangibles less 4.6 million foreign currency translation gain.
Deferred contingent consideration represents the managements estimate of the deferred payments expected to be made to the former FXOnline share option holders at 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 as a result of the cancellation of their options on acquisition by the Group.
The directors consider that the fair value of the goodwill of 87.1 million that arose on the acquisition of FXOnline is reasonable and related to certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured.
The goodwill includes the future growth potential of the business, the assembled workforce as well as revenue and cost synergies expected to accrue to the Group.
These assets are not separately identifiable.
