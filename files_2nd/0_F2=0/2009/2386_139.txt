1 2 3 OMS at the front line BPs operating management system OMS provides us with a systematic framework for safe, reliable and ef cient operations.
Throughout 2009 OMS helped us to deliver continuous improvement in how we manage our people, processes, plant and performance.
From onshore facilities to offshore platforms, a total of 47 exploration and production operating sites completed 4 their transition to OMS by the end of 2009, with the remaining seven sites on track to transition to OMS in 2010.
North America Gas has led the way, with all 16 of its sites already up and running on OMS.
Ultimately, OMS is about helping BP people identify and eliminate defects and deliver tangible improvements at the front line, day after day after day.
In the words of Mike Rees, production foreman at our Whitney Canyon facility: The OMS process of identifying gaps, establishing priorities, setting targets and assigning accountabilities has streamlined our annual business planning process and is driving improvements into our system.
OMS represents a step-change in operational management, but there is no nishing line.
As each site transitions to OMS its focus switches to driving continuous improvement.
