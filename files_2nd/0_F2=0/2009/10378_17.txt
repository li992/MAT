Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009 1.
General information Mitchells & Butlers plc the Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Group revalues its freehold and long leasehold land and buildings to fair value, for accounting purposes, which it reviews at least annually.
Short leasehold properties, fixtures and fittings are held at deemed cost on transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment provisions, which is also considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value in accordance with the Groups policy or their fair value less costs to sell where this is lower.
The Groups policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts.
The Groups accounting policies have been applied consistently, although certain exemptions to the retrospective application of IFRS have been made by the Group in accordance with IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling rounded to the nearest million, being the functional currency of the primary economic environment in which the parent and most subsidiaries operate.
The Groups accounting reference date is 30 September.
The Group draws up its financial statements to the Saturday directly before or following the accounting reference date, as permitted by section 390 3 of the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, include property valuations, asset impairments, pensions and tax.
See Property, plant and equipment, Employee benefits and Tax below see also Risks and uncertainties on pages 24 to 27 for further information regarding these areas.
Actual results may differ from estimates.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same financial reporting period as the Company.
Where necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising in respect of acquisitions, being the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value attributed to the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
The impairment review requires management to undertake certain judgements, including estimating the recoverable value of the business to which the goodwill relates, based on either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use, in order to reach a conclusion as to whether it deems the goodwill to be recoverable.
Value in use estimates are based on managements projection of the cash flows that the business will generate, after applying a suitable discount rate see note 13 Goodwill and other intangible assets for further information.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on managements assessment of the net proceeds which could be generated through disposing of the business to which the goodwill relates.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 September 1998 was eliminated against reserves.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill denominated in foreign currencies is translated into sterling at each balance sheet date and any movements are accounted for as set out under Foreign currencies.
ii Computer software Computer software and associated development costs, which are not an integral part of a related item of hardware, are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life.
The period of amortisation ranges between three and ten years with the majority being five years.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 61 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009 continued 1.
General information continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, freehold and long leasehold land and buildings are revalued to fair value for accounting purposes.
Short leasehold properties, fixtures and fittings are held at deemed cost on transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment provisions.
Surpluses which arise from the revaluation exercise are recorded directly within the revaluation reserve unless they are reversing a revaluation adjustment which has been recognised in the income statement previously: in which case an amount equal to a maximum of that recognised in the income statement previously is recognised in income.
Where the revaluation exercise gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected directly in the revaluation reserve to the extent that a surplus exists against the same asset.
Any residual amount is then recognised against income, as a revaluation adjustment, or as impairment where it exceeds the assets recoverable value see below.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold properties are depreciated so that the difference between their carrying value and estimated residual value is written off over 50 years from the date of acquisition.
The residual value of freehold and long leasehold properties is reviewed at least annually and no depreciation is charged where the residual value is estimated to be equal to or exceed the carrying value, so that the depreciation charge would be immaterial.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over the unexpired term of the lease where this is less than 50 years.
The cost less residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings and equipment is spread by equal instalments over the estimated life of the relevant assets, namely: Equipment in retail outlets 3-20 years Information technology equipment 3-7 years Vehicles 4-5 years Fixtures and fittings 4-20 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year and adjusted if appropriate.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not revalued to fair market value are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an outlet exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an outlets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In determining the value in use of an outlet, the Group is required to make various judgements regarding the outlets projected cash flows and the appropriate discount rate to apply to these.
These judgements include estimating the future growth rate and profitability of the outlet.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups When the value of an asset or group of assets will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use, the assets are reclassified as non-current assets held for sale, or as a disposal group, where the assets are to be sold as a group in a single transaction.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The Board of Directors must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups are valued at the lower of book value and fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
Leases i Operating leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases and sub-leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction in the rental expense over the lease term.
Premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Such premiums are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current prepayments, with the current portion being the element which relates to the following financial period.
62 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary The Groups policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts.
ii Finance leases Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Property, plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease are capitalised at the inception of the lease at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance lease obligation and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work in progress is in respect of property development activities and includes the direct costs of the developments and associated professional fees.
Financial instruments i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
ii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short-term highly liquid deposits with an original maturity at acquisition of three months or less.
Cash held on deposit with an original maturity at acquisition of more than three months is disclosed as current asset investments.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that are integral to the Groups cash management.
iii Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at original cost.
iv Borrowings Borrowings, which include the Groups secured loan notes, are stated initially at fair value normally, the amount of the proceeds, net of issue costs.
Thereafter they are stated at amortised cost using an effective interest basis.
Finance costs, which are the difference between the net proceeds and the total amount of payments to be made in respect of the instruments, are allocated over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
v Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses interest rate and currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting is applied where the necessary criteria under IAS 39 are met.
Inflation swap contracts and gilt hedges used to mitigate the Groups anticipated exposure to movements in the retail price index and the value of its fixed rate debt, were closed out in the prior year.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of highly probable future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Movements in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, the cumulative gain or loss in equity remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
vi Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 63 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009 continued 1.
General information continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at cost using the exchange rate on the date of the initial transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the results and the retranslation of opening net assets denominated in foreign currencies are taken directly to the Groups translation reserve.
When an overseas operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Revenue Revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting sales-based taxes, coupons and staff discounts.
The majority of revenue comprises food and beverages sold in the Groups outlets.
This revenue is recognised at the point of sale to the customer.
Revenue arising from the sale of development property is recognised on legal completion of the sale.
Tax The income tax expense represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred tax and is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited to equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount of their tax bases.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based on a number of financial assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the balance sheet valuation.
These are set out and discussed in note 7 Pensions.
The current service cost, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service, is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or finance expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, in the statement of recognised income and expense, rather than the income statement.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
ii Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the number of shares that will eventually vest due to employees leaving the employment of the Group.
Fair values are calculated using a combination of Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and applied its requirements to only those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury are deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.
64 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured using the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Adjusted profit In addition to presenting information on an IFRS basis, the Group also presents adjusted profit and earnings per share information that excludes exceptional items and other adjustments including the related tax on these items.
This adjusted information is disclosed to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group and is consistent with the Groups internal management reporting.
Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Other adjustments excluded from adjusted profit and earnings per share, comprise IAS 39 movements and for the first time this year, the IAS 19 net pensions finance charge the presentation of the comparative numbers has been revised to take account of this change in disclosure, which has not changed total profit.
Both the IAS 39 movements and the net pensions finance charge can be volatile, as they are calculated with reference to long-term interest rates and both are non-cash numbers.
IAS 39 movements represent movements in the fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore recognised in the income statement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires the pension scheme liabilities to be discounted to a present value, using a corporate bond rate.
The net pensions finance charge consists of the net of the movement in this discount and the notional return expected to be earned on the pension scheme assets.
Recent accounting developments The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which could impact the Group, with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
They have not been adopted early by the Group.
IAS 1 Revised is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and requires separate presentation of owner and non-owner changes in equity, introducing a statement of comprehensive income.
This will replace the statement of recognised income and expense currently presented by the Group.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and provides guidance on the amount of surplus in a defined benefit pension scheme that can be recognised as an asset under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment vesting conditions and cancellations amendments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and clarifies the terms vesting conditions and cancellations used in the standard.
IFRS 7 Amendment Financial Instruments: Disclosure is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and requires enhanced disclosure of fair value measurements and liquidity risks relating to financial instruments.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments replaces IAS 14 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
It requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
Upon the adoption of IFRS 8, the Group anticipates revising the presentation of its segment information to align this with the management structure put in place by Adam Fowle, following his appointment as Chief Executive in the period.
The Group is currently considering whether the standards and interpretations above will impact the presentation of its consolidated results, but do not anticipate that the adoption of the new standards or revisions to existing standards will have a material impact on the income or net assets reported in the Groups financial statements in the period of initial adoption.
Exchange rates The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the weighted average euro rate of exchange for the financial period of 1 1.15 2008 1 1.31, where this is a reasonable approximation to the rate at the dates of the transactions.
Euro and US denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the balance sheet date of 1 1.09 2008 1 1.26 and 1 $1.60 2008 1 $1.84 respectively.

Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in the year is 3m 2008 4m which comprises share option schemes and share awards.
The Group had six share schemes, all of which are equity-settled, in operation during the year.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan is a HMRC approved savings scheme, whereby the proceeds from a savings contract, of either three or five years duration, may be used to purchase shares under option.
Options are typically granted in June or July of each year, at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of invitation.
There are no performance conditions.
The scheme is open to all UK employees provided that they have at least one years service at the date of invitation.
The vesting period is 39 months or 63 months and options may be exercised up to six months after the vesting date.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is a HMRC approved savings scheme open to all UK employees with at least 18 months service at the date of award.
The plan awards free shares to participating employees based on salary, up to a maximum award of 3,000 per employee per year.
There is a vesting period of two years from the award date.
Shares are generally held in Trust for at least three years and are capable of being released to participants at any time thereafter.
68 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan Under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan the annual bonuses of the Executive Directors may be deferred into Mitchells & Butlers plc shares with one Matching Share awarded for every Bonus Share.
From the grant in December 2006 participants are also entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Matching shares will only be released in full if the Groups average adjusted earnings per share including net pension income over the three year performance period ending 26 September 2009, exceeds by at least 27%, the increase in the UK Retail Price Index for the same period.
All outstanding awards vest three years after the award date and shares are transferred to participants on vesting.
No award was granted relating to the 2006 07 or 2008 09 bonus year due to the losses suffered by the Company from the hedge closures in these periods.
All deferrals of bonuses into shares to date have been entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance Restricted Share Plan The Performance Restricted Share Plan allows Executive Directors and other eligible employees to receive nominal cost options, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, set by the Remuneration Committee, which are normally measured over a three year period.
Vesting is conditional upon the achievement of total shareholder return TSR and cash return on cash capital employed CROCCE performance conditions.
The vesting period for these options is generally three years followed by a two year exercise period.
In respect of the TSR performance condition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to incorporate the market condition in the measurement of the fair value.
For all grants from 2005 06 onwards, participants will be entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Executive Share Option Plan The grant of options under the Executive Share Option Plan was discontinued following shareholder approval of changes to Executive Director remuneration in 2006.
The vesting period for these options is three years from grant, followed by a seven year exercise period.
The latest possible exercise date for any of these options outstanding at 26 September 2009 is 23 June 2015.
Rolled-over options Under the terms of the separation in 2003, holders of options under the Six Continents Executive Share Option Schemes were given the opportunity to exchange their Six Continents PLC options for equivalent value new options over Mitchells & Butlers plc shares.
The exchanged options are not subject to performance conditions and were immediately exercisable.
The latest possible exercise date for any of the Rolled-over options outstanding at 26 September 2009 is 28 May 2012.
Further details of the above schemes, including future changes to the Performance Restricted Share Plan and Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan, are included in the Remuneration report on pages 42 to 55.
The following tables set out awards and options granted during 2009.
No options under the Executive Share Option Plan or Rolled-over options were granted during the period.

For details relating to the Groups current dividend policy see note 20 on page 86. d The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
Where insufficient share price data is available, competitor share price volatility data over a longer period equal to the expected life of the option or share award is considered.
e The expected term of the options is taken to be the midpoint between vesting and lapse, except for the Performance Restricted Share Plan where the terms of the plan resulted in it being advantageous for participants to exercise directly after vesting.
In this case the expected life has been assumed to equate to the vesting period.
The fair value of awards under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan is equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to this scheme.
The fair value of the Share Incentive Plan shares is equal to the share price on the date of grant as there is no option price to be paid and employees are entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
Hence the assumptions set out above are not relevant to this scheme.
The Dividend Accrued Shares awarded during the period have no incremental fair value as this has already been included within the fair value of the original award through the dividend yield assumption, as noted above.

Pensions Background Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 and updated by the schemes qualified actuaries to 26 September 2009.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 26 September 2009 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds see Discount rate assumption in the table below.
The IAS 19 deficit calculated on this basis is 130 m 2008 23 m, 2007 18 m as set out below.
The discount rate applied to the pension schemes liabilities is significant to the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity.
It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in this rate would, in isolation, reduce or increase the net balance sheet deficit by approximately 25m, with no impact on the income statement charge.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
As the defined benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
Principal financial assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 a b b Wages and salaries increases 2.0% 5.0% 4.9% 4.4% 4.3% Pensions increases 3.3% 3.5% 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% Discount rate 5.5% 6.5% 5.9% 5.0% 5.0% Inflation rate 3.3% 3.5% 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% a Reflects the impact of pension changes introduced during the period b Represents the assumption for MABPP members 6.0% for MABEPP members 2007 5.9%.
This included allowance for promotional salary increases Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 year of birth standard tables with allowance for medium cohort projections, with ages rated up by two years for non-retired members of the MABPP, by three years for current pensioners and rated down by two years for members of the MABEPP.
The mortality assumptions adopted have been updated to allow for improvements in life expectancies, taking into account an analysis of the recent experience of the plans.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2009 2008 Main plan Exec plan Main plan Exec plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 19.4 23.6 19.4 23.6 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 21.2 24.8 21.2 24.8 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 22.2 26.5 22.2 26.5 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 24.0 27.7 24.0 27.7 72 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary Amounts recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes The long-term rates of return on assets at 26 September 2009 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2010 financial year.
The 2008 rates shown are used in calculating the 2009 expected return.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 5.5% 2008 6.1%, 2007 6.1%.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the year was 7.9% 2008 5.4 %, 2007 9.1%, which represented a gain of 84m 2008 loss of 71m, 2007 gain of 98m.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Long-term Long-term Long-term rates rates rates of return of return of return expected Value expected Value expected Value % m % m % m Equities 7.5 467 8.2 359 7.9 345 Bonds 4.5 800 5.3 814 5.9 854 Property 7.5 13 8.2 38 7.9 93 Fair value of assets 1,280 1,211 1,292 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,410 1,234 1,310 Deficit in the schemes recognised as a liability in the balance sheet 130 23 18 Associated deferred tax asset 36 6 5 The following amounts relating to the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of recognised income and expense: 2009 2008 2007 Group income statement m m m Operating profit: Current service cost defined benefit plans 10 13 13 Current service cost defined contribution plans 2 2 1 Exceptional pension credit 44 Credit charge to operating profit 32 15 14 Finance income: Expected return on pension scheme assets 73 79 74 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 79 76 63 Net finance charge income in respect of pensions 6 3 11 Total credit charge 26 12 3 2009 2008 2007 Group statement of recognised income and expense m m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 10 150 24 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 184 115 9 Actuarial loss gain recognised 174 35 33 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 73 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009 continued 7.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 26 September 2004.
Funding valuation and future funding obligations The results of the 2007 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and on 23 April 2008 the Company formally agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The result of this is that the Group has made additional contributions of 24m during the current financial year and will make further additional contributions of 24m in each of the financial years from 2010 to 2017, subject to review following the next actuarial valuation at 31 March 2010.
In the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009, the Group paid regular contributions of 15m 2008 16m, 2007 10m and additional contributions of 24m 2008 24m, 2007 40m in respect of the defined benefit arrangements.
In addition the Group paid 2m 2008 2m, 2007 1m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements.
Employer contribution rates to the defined benefit arrangements for the 52 weeks ending 25 September 2010 are 24.2% for the MABPP and 48.5% for the MABEPP.
Based on these contribution rates, it is estimated that total contributions in the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010 will be 40m, comprising regular contributions of 16m, including 2m payable in respect of the defined contribution arrangements and additional contributions of 24m.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items see note 8, IAS 39 movements see note 9 and the net pensions finance charge see note 7, in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

All amortisation charges have been expensed through operating costs.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill in 2008 related entirely to the German business, which is also the non-UK reportable segment.
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Following the conclusion of the strategic review in May 2008 that the Group would seek to create additional value from the German business, the Group deemed it appropriate to value the business based on its estimated arms length market value as at 27 September 2008.
As a result, it fully provided for impairment against the goodwill associated with the business, as it did not anticipate that the market value would be sufficient to recover the goodwill carrying value.

Property, plant and equipment continued Properties A policy of valuing the majority of the Groups freehold and long leasehold land and buildings, for accounting purposes, was adopted on 29 September 2007.
Short leasehold properties and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at deemed cost at transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment, which is also considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
The Group accounts for long leasehold land as an operating lease.
The freehold and long leasehold land and buildings were valued at market value, as at 26 September 2009 and 27 September 2008 by Colliers CRE plc, independent chartered surveyors and by Andrew Cox MRICS, Director of Property, Chartered Surveyor.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of the location, the quality of the pub or restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Changes in these assumptions such as the valuation basis applied in comparable market transactions, or the income level generated by a pub could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold land and buildings.
It is estimated that a 1% change in the EBITDA of the freehold and long leasehold land and buildings would generate a 1% movement in their valuation.
On 19 September 2008, the Group announced that it had completed a deal to exchange 21 of its hotels these were included within the Restaurants operating segment, see note 2, segmental analysis, until the date of completion for 44 individual pub restaurants owned by Whitbread plc.
The hotels, which were carried at a fair value of 78m are included within 2008 disposals above.
The pub restaurants acquired are included at their fair value of 85m within 2008 additions, including 3m of stamp duty land tax and 5m of costs which were directly related to the asset exchange.
No profit or loss arose on the transaction and no cash proceeds were received.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,863m 2008 3,974m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
Finance leases The net book value of fixtures, fittings and equipment includes 3m 2008 2m in respect of assets held under finance leases.
The assets are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities.

Securitised debt On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued 1,900m of secured loan notes in connection with the securitisation of the majority of the Groups UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a special dividend.
On 15 September 2006 Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc completed the issue of 655m of further secured loan notes in the form of the A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes as detailed below.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation in November 2003.
The funds raised were mainly used to return 486m to shareholders by way of a special dividend and to provide long-term funding for the Whitbread pub restaurant sites acquired.
As part of the issue, the original A1 and A3 loan note tranches were repaid and reissued as A1N and A3N loan notes to take advantage of market rates.
At 26 September 2009 the loan notes consisted of 10 tranches as follows: Initial Effective principal interest Principal outstanding borrowed Principal repayment period rate at 26 September 2009 Expected c Tranche m Interest all by instalments % m WAL b A1N 200 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.69 200 1 year A2 550 Fixed5.57% 2003 to 2028 6.01 401 10 years a b a A3N 250 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.92 250 1 year b A4 170 Floating 2016 to 2028 5.24 170 4 years b AB 325 Floating 2020 to 2032 5.25 325 4 years B1 350 Fixed5.97% 2003 to 2023 6.12 274 7 years B2 350 Fixed6.01% 2015 to 2028 6.12 350 15 years C1 200 Fixed6.47% 2029 to 2030 6.57 200 20 years b C2 50 Floating 2033 to 2034 5.44 50 4 years b D1 110 Floating 2034 to 2036 5.50 110 4 years a a 2,555 2,330 82 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary At 27 September 2008 the loan notes consisted of 10 tranches as follows: Initial Effective principal interest Principal outstanding borrowed Principal repayment period rate at 27 September 2008 Expected c Tranche m Interest all by instalments % m WAL b A1N 200 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.69 200 2 years A2 550 Fixed5.57% 2003 to 2028 6.01 429 11 years a b a A3N 250 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.92 250 2 years b A4 170 Floating 2016 to 2028 5.24 170 5 years b AB 325 Floating 2020 to 2032 5.25 325 5 years B1 350 Fixed5.97% 2003 to 2023 6.12 291 8 years B2 350 Fixed6.01% 2015 to 2028 6.12 350 16 years C1 200 Fixed6.47% 2029 to 2030 6.57 200 21 years b C2 50 Floating 2033 to 2034 5.44 50 5 years b D1 110 Floating 2034 to 2036 5.50 110 5 years a a 2,555 2,375 a Includes the fair value impact of 12 m 2008 22m in respect of the currency swaps b After the effect of interest rate swaps c The Group has an unconditional right to continue to hold the individual note tranches through to their final maturity dates.
In accordance with IFRS 7 however, the expected remaining weighted average life WAL is based on the amortisation profile of the individual note tranches calculated on the basis of the refinancing of the notes on the margin step-up dates.
The margin step-up dates as at 26 September 2009 are set out below.
The notes are secured on the majority of the Groups property and future income streams therefrom.
All of the floating rate notes are fully hedged using interest rate swaps which fix the interest rate payable.
Interest and margin is payable on the floating rate notes as follows: Tranche Interest Margin Margin step-up date Post step-up margin A1N 3 month LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45% A3N 3 month $ LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45% A4 3 month LIBOR 0.23% September 2013 0.58% AB 3 month LIBOR 0.24% September 2013 0.60% C2 3 month LIBOR 0.75% September 2013 1.88% D1 3 month LIBOR 0.85% September 2013 2.13% The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 5.7% 2008 5.7% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A and AB notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 26 September 2009, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd had cash and cash equivalents of 91m 2008 118m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 15m 2008 14m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions restricted cash.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the securitised debt in the Group balance sheet at 26 September 2009 is analysed as follows: 2009 2008 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 2,353 2,371 Principal repaid during the period 45 41 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 34 23 Principal outstanding at end of period 2,342 2,353 Deferred issue costs 15 18 Accrued interest 4 4 Carrying value at end of period 2,331 2,339 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 83 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009 continued 19.
Borrowings continued At 26 September 2009 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities: 2009 2008 a Undrawn committed borrowing facilities m m Unutilised facilities expire: Within one year Between two and five years 167 86 167 86 a In addition to the undrawn amounts against the medium-term facility see below, the Group holds an undrawn 295m 2008 295m liquidity facility against the securitised arrangements, sized to cover 18 months debt service, which is not available for any other purpose.
This is not included in the table above.
Medium-term borrowing facilities On 24 July 2008 the Group entered into a three year 600m term and revolving credit facility the medium-term facility expiring on 30 November 2011, including a 300m revolving credit facility, for general business purposes which incurs interest at LIBOR plus a margin.
The facility was set at 600m initially but reduced to 550m in December 2008.
On 20 May 2009 the facility was amended to provide an additional 75m.
At the same time, 75m of the facility originally due for payment on 31 December 2009 was prepaid.
As at 26 September 2009 the Group had drawn an amount of 376m net of deferred issue costs against the facility which forms part of the Other borrowings balance.
On 30 September 2009 a further 75m of the facility was prepaid, reducing the outstanding facility to 475m.
The movements in the facility are set out below.

Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is the responsibility of the Groups treasury function.
The Groups treasury function is governed by a Board Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed at least annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies are set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
These are discussed further below.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections and three year plan.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist primarily of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility and the medium-term funding facility drawn by Mitchells & Butlers Retail No 2 Ltd. Further information regarding these arrangements is included in note 19.
The terms of both the securitisation and the medium-term facility contain a number of financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group treasury.
84 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
Committed facilities outside of the securitisation are sized to ensure that the Group can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
The maturity table below details the contractual, undiscounted cash flows both principal and interest for the Groups financial liabilities after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the analysis is calculated on the assumption that the Groups securitised loan notes are refinanced on the margin step-up dates, however, the Group has an unconditional right to continue to hold individual loan note tranches through to their final maturity dates.
Trade and other payables are excluded from the table: these are short-term and are disclosed in note 18.

These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long term and A1 P1 short term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
An amount of 18m 2008 nil of collateral was posted by the swap provider within the securitisation as at 26 September 2009.
This is excluded from cash and cash equivalents in note 20, but is included within Bank & cash in the credit exposure table below.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Exceptions are formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four weekly basis.
The Group reported in its interim statements that as at 11 April 2009, 20m of cash collateral deposits were held with the counterparties to the 225m swaps and the forward starting interest rate swaps which were retained following the property joint venture discussions in 2008.
This amount was used as part of the 95 m settlement cost of these swaps excluding accrued interest on 20 May 2009 see Derivative financial instruments closed out in the period below, at which point the collateral requirement was removed.

Financial instruments continued Capital risk The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 27 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity and cash flow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt compared to equity see also Funding and liquidity risk above and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its bank debts see page 83 note 19.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
In May 2009 the Group amended its medium-term bank facility, to provide an additional 75m, which reduces to 37.5m in December 2010 and matures in November 2011.
In November 2008 the Group announced that it will not consider restoring its dividend payments until drawings on its medium-term facility are adequately below 300m.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives.
Total capital at 26 September 2009 is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Net debt see note 27 2,600 2,735 Total equity 997 1,175 Total capital 3,597 3,910 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: US$418.75m of Class A3N floating rate notes which form part of the securitised debt see note 19.
At issuance of the notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and interest elements of the notes.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from its operations.
Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 2.3bn securitisation is fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which 100% effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
The Groups medium-term facility incurs floating rate interest based on LIBOR.
Drawings against this facility are partially hedged using interest rate swaps, with a notional principal amount of 150m see Cash flow hedges unsecured borrowings on page 87.
These swaps qualify for hedge accounting and movements in their mark-to-market values are recognised directly in equity, with the cumulative gain or loss transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the hedged elements of the facility are recognised against profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a loss of 88m 2008 20m loss on cash flow hedges was recognised directly in equity.
A gain of 11m 2008 30m gain was removed from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash flow hedges securitised borrowings At 26 September 2009, the Group held 10 2008 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 1,105m 2008 1,105m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 1,105m 2008 1,105m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8938% 2008 4.8938%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 107 m 2008 1m asset.
At 26 September 2009 the Group held one 2008 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 250m 2008 250m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N floating rate $418.75m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 5m 2008 28 m liability.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a fixed rate, in sterling, of 5.4445% 2008 5.4445%.
Cash flow hedges unsecured borrowings Between 11 and 12 June 2009 the Group entered into short dated interest rate swaps with a notional principal of 150m and a maturity date of 23 December 2010, which swap the LIBOR based floating interest rate on its medium-term financing facility into a fixed rate of 1.9788%.
The swaps, which limit the Groups exposure to short-term fluctuations in the LIBOR element of drawings against the facility, meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are therefore accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The cash flows on the swaps are settled quarterly.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 2 m 2008 n a.
Derivative financial instruments closed out in the period The Group reported in its 2008 Annual report and accounts that it had closed out the hedges no longer required to support the property joint venture transaction proposed with R20 at that time, but had retained interest rate swaps with an initial notional principal of 225m as a hedge against part of its 600m medium-term facility, which amortised to 550m from December 2008.
The Groups intended course of action was to refinance the medium-term facility into a longer-term secured facility.
Following a deterioration in the mark-to-market deficit of the 225m retained hedge however, in order to limit its exposure to further adverse fair value movements on the hedge, whilst banking discussions continued, the Group acquired forward starting swaps on 11 March 2009, which fixed the economic fair value of the 225m swaps at an amount of approximately 95 m. The ongoing illiquidity in the long-term debt markets meant that refinancing the mediumterm facility into a longer term facility was unlikely to be possible in the near future and as a result of this, on 20 May 2009 the Group closed out both the 225m swaps and the forward starting swaps at their fair value of 95 m excluding accrued interest.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows.
These values were measured at 26 September 2009 and may be subject to material movements in the period subsequent to the balance sheet date.

As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
