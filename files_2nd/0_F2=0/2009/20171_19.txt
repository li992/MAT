Jerseys tax regime changed with effect from 1 January 2009.
Under the new regime, Jersey incorporated companies will be treated as resident in Jersey and will be subject to a corporate income tax rate of 0%, applicable generally, or 10%, applicable to certain regulated financial services companies.
As the Company is not a regulated financial services company for these purposes, the effect of the new Jersey tax regime is limited to a change from exempt company status to being subject to Jersey corporate income tax at the 0% rate.
Subsidiaries of the Company have provided for taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.
As the investment returns of these subsidiaries are largely exempt from tax, in the relevant countries where they are subject to tax, the total tax provided in respect of them is minimal.

All debt investments are held at fair value.

This note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risks and uncertainties section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards investment committee and Investment Advisers investment process is part of the overall risk management framework.
The funding objective of the Group and Company is that each category of investment is broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets and that funding needs are met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowings and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in note 12 and the Groups and the Companys equity is analysed into its various components in the Reconciliation of movements in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, as a closed ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital, therefore the Directors consider that the Company has met all of its external capital requirements throughout the period.
Capital is allocated for investment in Utilities, Transportation and Social Infrastructure across the UK, Continental Europe, Asia and the US.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 20% of gross assets including cash holdings.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with a credit rating AA or better.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the loan.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
At 31 March 2009 there were no loans and receivables considered past due or impaired 2008: nil for the Group and Company.
3i Infrastructure actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2009 the Group does not consider itself to have exposure to one large counterparty.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Risks and uncertainties section on page 24.
The table below analyses the maturity of the Groups contractual liabilities.

The Groups and the Companys sensitivities to these are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risks and uncertainties section on page 24.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small.
An increase of 250 basis points over 12 months would lead to an approximate exposure on net assets and to the income statement of 12.7 million for the Group 2008: increase of 100 basis points 2.6 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest payable and receivable on floating rate and short-term debt instruments and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and floating rate debt instruments held at year end.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
The Company does not hold variable rate loans as assets or liabilities and is therefore only exposed to interest rate risk on its cash holdings.
An increase of 250 basis points over 12 months would lead to an approximate exposure on net assets and to the income statement of 9.8 million for the Company 2008: increase of 100 basis points 2.6 million.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risks and uncertainties section on page 24.
The currency denomination of the Groups net assets in euros and US dollars are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Group and Companys net assets to movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

A 10% change in the fair value of those investments 2008: 5% change in the fair value would have the following direct impact on the income statement: As at 31 March 2009 As at 31 March 2008 Quoted Unquoted Debt Quoted Unquoted Debt equity investments investments Total equity investments investments Total m m m m m m m m Group 0.4 64.0 9.2 73.6 0.6 27.5 28.1 The Company had no direct exposure to market price risk as at 31 March 2009.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movement in price.
However, the Directors have a set investment policy that sets predefined limits for the exposure of the Group to an individual asset.
These limits have not been exceeded at 31 March 2009, and hence, the Directors do not consider that any of these investments represent a large exposure.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology page 56.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values.
The Portfolio section describes assets held at fair value through profit and loss.

The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
At the balance sheet date the notional amount of forward foreign exchange contracts was 120.9 million 2008: 40.8 million.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses variable to fixed interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its floating-rate interest-bearing borrowings.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through the income statement.
At the balance sheet date the notional amount of interest rate swaps was 176.7 million 2008: 151.0 million.
