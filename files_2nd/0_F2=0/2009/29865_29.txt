Fees in respect of services as Directors are paid by the Company only to those Directors who are independent of Franklin Templeton Investments.
Included within these costs are Employer National Insurance contributions.
As at 30 April 2009, 0.3 million 30 April 2008: 0.7 million, in fees were payable and outstanding to FTIML.
Following the outcome of a recent European Court of Justice Case, HM Revenue & Customs HMRC has accepted that management fees charged to Investment Trusts can be treated as exempt for Value Added Tax VAT purposes.
The Company had lodged claims with HMRC to recover VAT previously overpaid by it.
These claims have largely been resolved with HMRC, with the exception of the period from November 1996 to January 2001.
A total of 1.8 million of VAT, plus interest, has been received from HMRC to date.
Full credit has been taken by the Company in respect of the claim monies received.
The remaining period is currently capped by statutory limitation, but this is subject to an unrelated separate legal challenge.
Since the eventual outcome cannot be accurately predicted at this time no credit has been taken into these accounts for any amounts that may be recoverable for this period.
