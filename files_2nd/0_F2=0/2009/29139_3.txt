As total borrowings have a current fair value above par, the effect of valuing the borrowings at fair value reduces both the NAV and resultant discount.
# Both revenue earnings and the dividend include a non-recurring 1.5p per share from the reimbursement of previous years VAT and associated interest thereon.
The percentage changes excluding the non-recurring 1.5p are revenue earnings 13.9% and dividend 4.9%.
