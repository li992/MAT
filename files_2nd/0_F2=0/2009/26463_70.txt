GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSET OBLIGATION The Group operates separate defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The assets of the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes in the UK are held separately from those of the Group in a separate trustee administered fund and the funds are primarily managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited, Investec Investment Management Limited, Morley Fund Management Limited, Mellon Fund Managers Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited.
On 27 March 2009, a proportion of the funds managed by Schroders Investment Management Limited were transferred to PIMCO Europe Limited.
The Italian plan relates to the severance and leaving indemnity scheme TFR operated by Borsa Italiana Group in accordance with Italian law.
The Company has no retirement benefit obligations.
Defined benefit scheme The UK defined benefit scheme is non-contributory and provides benefits based on final pensionable pay related to salary earned in the last five years of employment.
The scheme was closed to new members in 1999 but provides retirement benefits to approximately 10 per cent of current and many former employees.
Pension scheme obligations and costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on a regular basis using the projected unit credit method.
The obligations are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme and are reflected in the Group balance sheet.
The TFR operated by Borsa Italiana group is classified as an unfunded defined benefit scheme for funds accumulated prior to 1 July 2007.
The service cost, representing deferred salaries accruing to employees, was included as an operating expense and was determined by law at 6.91 per cent of salary payments subject to certain adjustments.
The scheme obligation comprises accumulated service costs and is revalued by law at a rate equal to 75 per cent of national life price index 1.5 per cent by an independent qualified actuary.
Since 1 July 2007, the Group retains no obligation as contributions are made directly into Italian state funds in the manner of a defined contribution scheme.
Defined contribution schemes The Groups defined contribution schemes are now the only schemes open to new employees.
For the UK pension plan, a core contribution of eight per cent of pensionable pay is provided and the Group will match employee contributions up to a maximum of six per cent of pensionable pay.
For the Italian plan, 6.19 per cent of pensionable pay is provided.

London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report 2009 77 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Defined benefit actuarial gains and losses recognised The experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions of the pension scheme during the year are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense: 2009 2008 UK Pension Italian plan UK Pension Italian plan m m m m Recognised up to 1 April 15.5 0.6 6.3 Net actuarial loss gain recognised in the year 11.0 0.7 21.8 0.6 Cumulative amount recognised at 31 March 4.5 1.3 15.5 0.6 The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out at 31 March 2006 by an independent qualified actuary.
Following the valuation, ordinary contributions were increased from 23 per cent to 36 per cent of pensionable salaries.
In addition, the Group agreed to contribute an additional 5.0m per annum towards the scheme depending on the level of funding deficit.
Accordingly the Group expects to contribute approximately 6.4m to the defined benefit scheme during the year to 31 March 2010.
The Group is currently carrying out its triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2009, which may result in an adjustment to future contribution levels.
The Group estimates the duration of defined benefit obligations on average to be 20 years.
