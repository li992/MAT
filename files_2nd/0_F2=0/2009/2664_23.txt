Capital contribution reserve is the amount arising from share-based payments made by parties associated with the original Principal Shareholders and cash held by the Employee Trust.
Retained earnings represent cumulative profit loss for the year, share-based payments and any other items of other comprehensive income not disclosed as separate reserves in the table above.
The other reserve of $825.4 million is the amount arising from the application of accounting which is similar to the pooling of interests method, as set out in the Groups accounting policies.
Under this method of accounting, the difference between the consideration for the controlling interest and the nominal value of the shares acquired is taken to other reserves on consolidation.
As a result, the retained earnings reflect the cumulative profits as if the current Group structure had always been in place.
Currency reserve represents the gains losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into US dollars.
