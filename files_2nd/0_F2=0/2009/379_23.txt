87 Notes to the Companys financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The Directors report, Corporate governance and Directors remuneration report disclosures have been made in the Group section of this annual report, refer to pages 24 to 38.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS 1 revised and has not presented a cash ow statement.
The Groups cash ow statement has been presented in the Group financial statements.
In accordance with Related Party Disclosures FRS 8, the Company is exempt from disclosing transactions with entities that are part of the Aegis Group, or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties, as it is a parent publishing consolidated financial statements.
As the parent company of a group drawing up consolidated financial statements that meet the requirements of IFRS 7, it is exempt from disclosures that comply with its UK GAAP equivalent, FRS 29 Financial Instruments Disclosures.
Employee bene ts The retirement bene ts for employees are principally provided by fide ned contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from the Company and employees.
The amount charged to pro t and loss is the contribution payable in the year.
Share-based payments The Company applies the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Certain employees receive remuneration in the form of Share-based payments, including shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the instruments concerned at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are ful lled, ending on the vesting date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date re ects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors at that date, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where a parent entity grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, UITF 44 requires the subsidiary to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payments, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, the Company has recognised an addition to xed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of 6.0m 2008: 7.8m, with a credit to equity for the same amount.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Leased assets Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and bene ts of ownership of the asset are classi ed as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the pro t and loss account over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Tangible assets Tangible xed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of all xed assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets at the following rates: Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10% 20% per annum or over the lease if shorter Of ce furniture, xtures, equipment and vehicles 10% 50% per annum Software 33% per annum Other 5% 10% per annum The carrying value of tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Investments Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are held in the Company balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Loans Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to pro t and loss as incurred using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Companys operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the pro t and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of xed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been re ected in the Companys financial statements.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the pro t and loss account as they arise.
