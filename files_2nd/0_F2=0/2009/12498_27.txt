91 Premier Farnell Annual Report & Accounts 2009 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those shares held by the Premier Farnell Executive Trust note 19.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume issue of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options and awards with a non-market based performance condition granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year, and those shares with a market based performance condition based on the current estimate of the number of shares that will vest under the performance criteria.
Reconciliations of earnings and the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: Basic Diluted Basic Diluted earnings earnings earnings earnings Earnings per share per share Earnings per share per share 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 52 weeks 52 weeks 52 weeks 53 weeks 53 weeks 53 weeks m pence pence m pence pence 51.7 14.3 14.2 Continuing operations 49.8 13.7 13.6 Discontinued operations 13.5 3.7 3.7 Total attributable to ordinary shareholders 51.7 14.3 14.2 36.3 10.0 9.9 Total earnings per share Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 51.7 14.3 14.2 36.3 10.0 9.9 Gain on purchase of preference shares 3.7 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.3 0.3 Restructuring costs 3.4 0.9 0.9 Tax attributable to restructuring costs 1.0 0.3 0.3 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders before gain on purchase of preference shares and restructuring costs 50.4 13.9 13.8 35.4 9.7 9.6 Earnings per share from continuing operations Profit after taxation from continuing operations 51.7 14.3 14.2 49.8 13.7 13.6 Gain on purchase of preference shares 3.7 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.3 0.3 Restructuring costs 3.4 0.9 0.9 Tax attributable to restructuring costs 1.0 0.3 0.3 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders before gain on purchase of preference shares and restructuring costs 50.4 13.9 13.8 48.9 13.4 13.3 Earnings per share before the gain on purchase of preference shares and excluding restructuring costs have been provided in order to facilitate year on year comparison.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 1 February 2009 of 5.2 pence per share which will absorb 18.8 million of shareholders funds.
This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting and thus has not been provided for at 1 February 2009.
Once approved, the final dividend will be paid on 24 June 2009 to shareholders on the register of members on 29 May 2009.

The recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations, which were performed for the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK, based on data available at the mid-point of the financial year, were as follows: Sales growth for the current year was based on internal forecasts with growth in the five subsequent years broadly in line with historic UK GDP and a terminal growth rate of 2.25% 2008: 2.25%.
Gross margins were projected based on recent trends.
A market risk premium, of 7.0% 2008: 4.5%, was used in calculating the weighted average cost of capital.
Forecast cash flows have been prepared for a period of five years.
From the second year onwards, the rate of growth used does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the industry in which the business operates.
The cash flows that these projections produce have been discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 8.4% 2008: 10.9%.
The Group applies post-tax discount rates to post-tax cash flows and this closely approximates to applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test.
The remaining goodwill of 5.9 million 2008: 4.5 million is allocated across five different cash generating units.
No impairments arose during the year in relation to these amounts.
The Directors believe there are no reasonably possible changes to a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.

The fair value of the debt element is established on issue of the shares, based on the discounted cash flows of the instrument to the date of maturity and is then increased each year on a straight line basis through the income statement in order to arrive at the redemption amount payable on maturity of the shares.
97 Premier Farnell Annual Report & Accounts 2009 15 Preference shares continued The movement in the debt and equity elements during the year is as follows: Equity Debt element element m m At 4 February 2008 15.2 85.9 Premium on redemption 0.9 Purchase of preference shares 4.8 27.4 At 1 February 2009 10.4 59.4 During the year the Company purchased and cancelled 1,824,302 of its preference shares at a total cash cost of 23.6 million.
Based on the book value and fair value of the instrument at the date of purchase, the financial liability element of the preference shares was reduced by 27.4 million and the equity element by 4.8 million.
A gain of 3.7 million was recognised in the income statement being the difference between the book value and fair value of the financial liability element at the date of purchase.
The gain arising from the difference between the book value and fair value of the equity element of 4.8 million was recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A deferred tax credit of 0.8 million arose which is also recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A transfer from retained earnings of 1.8 million to non-distributable reserves was made in order to maintain the legal nominal value of share capital.
In the prior year, the Company purchased and cancelled 1,236,500 of its preference shares at a total cost of 17.7 million, resulting in a gain of 0.9 million being recognised in the income statement.
A deferred tax credit of 0.6 million was recognised as a movement in retained earnings.

18 Financial instruments The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks in the normal course of business including liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Liquidity risk Established procedures are in place to ensure that the operational and working capital requirements of the Group can be met at all times.
These include: Weekly review, monitoring and forecasting of working capital requirements across Group companies Use of short term, local bank facilities Operation of short term money market dealing lines The implementation and ongoing review of committed multi-currency bank facilities, which are available at short notice.
At the year-end the Group had 212.1 million of available bilateral banking facilities, which carried a LIBOR based floating rate of interest.
The facilities were due to expire mid-2010, and at 1 February 2009 99.1 million of these facilities were unused.
On 27 January 2009 the Group entered into a new multi-currency revolving credit facility of 150 million, which carries a LIBOR based floating rate of interest, and expires in January 2013.
The first drawdown on this facility occurred in February 2009, at which point the previous facility terminated.
Credit risk The Group has a customer credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through the use of customer credit limits.
Investments are allowed only in short term instruments and only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings.
The Groups treasury policy stipulates the minimum credit rating that a banking institution must have before deposits can be made.
Given the high credit quality of counterparties with whom the Group has investments, the Directors do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its expectations.
At 1 February 2009 and 3 February 2008 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset included in the balance sheet.
Hedging interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are entered into, where necessary, to achieve this appropriate mix.
At 1 February 2009 the Group was not party to any interest rate swaps 3 February 2008: nil.
At 1 February 2009, if interest rates on foreign currency denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre tax profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher 2008: 0.2 million.
At 1 February 2009, if interest rates on pound sterling denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre tax profit for the year would have been 0.4 million lower higher 2008: 0.2 million.
