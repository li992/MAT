Share-based payment charges Share-based payment charges are calculated by spreading the fair value of an option over the vesting period having taken into account any performance conditions when estimating the number of options expected to vest.
The vesting period is typically one year 2008: three years from date of grant or the beginning of the bonus year in respect of grants under the MSEBP.
All options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model except grants under the LTIP and TIP which use the Monte Carlo option pricing model as they have market performance conditions which are included in the fair value calculation.

The Allscripts cash balances are restricted due to the sizeable minority interest.
During the year the Group obtained credit facilities of up to $340m for the purpose of acquiring Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.
These credit facilities were replaced by new facilities note 23.
Directly attributable transaction costs are deducted from the amount of the total credit facility, in line with the Groups accounting policy.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs were determined based on value-in-use calculations and no impairment was identi ed during the year.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash ows for each CGU based on approved budgets which are consistent with the recent financial performance of the relevant CGU.
Cash ows from year two to five are extrapolated using estimated growth rates stated below which are in accordance with businesses in which the CGU operates.
For Banking and TCM it was not necessary to look at cash ows beyond five years as cash ows within this time horizon were signi cantly in excess of the carrying amounts of the CGUs and hence the calculation is not sensitive to the discount rate used.
For Allscripts a terminal value at year five is included in the value-in-use calculation assuming no real growth.
A pre tax discount rate of between 13.5% and 16.0% was used which re ects speci c risks relating to the Group in each CGU.
Sustainable growth rates ranging from 3% -12% were used to determine cash ows for year two to five taking into account market conditions for each of the relevant business segments.
Direct and indirect costs and corporate overheads have been calculated using the same percentage of revenue as for the recent budget which gives the same average operating margin over the testing period.
Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development.
Sensitivity analyses have been performed around the base case assumptions with the conclusion that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount.
Goodwill disposed of in the prior year of 130.5m relates entirely to Hospital Systems which was disposed of in 2007 see note 4.
Annual Report 2009 | Misys plc 87 Notes to the financial statements Overview Business review 17 Goodwill continued Acquisition of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc On 10 October 2008 the Group acquired 56.8% of the issued share capital of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc for a cash consideration, including expenses, both paid and accrued, of 200.9m $330m plus related expenses.
As part of the acquisition, 100% ownership of Misys Healthcare Systems was transferred to Allscripts.
An analysis of the net assets acquired is shown below: Provisional Book fair value Provisional All gures in millions value adjustment fair value Intangible assets 70.3 69.2 139.5 Property, plant and equipment 13.0 1.8 11.2 Deferred tax liabilities 23.4 26.4 3.0 Cash 45.4 45.4 Other assets 68.9 0.3 68.6 Other liabilities 113.6 6.1 107.5 Net assets acquired 107.4 46.8 154.2 Minority interest 66.6 Misys shareholders interest 87.6 Goodwill 204.7 Total consideration 292.3 Total consideration of 292.3m includes the cash consideration of 200.9m including directly attributable expenses of 7.2m and the fair value attributed to the 43.2% net disposal of Misys Healthcare of 91.4m.
Misys Healthcares net assets at point of sale and costs incurred totalled 22.1m leaving a reported pro t of 69.3m.
The fair value adjustments contain provisional amounts which will be nalised within 12 months of acquisition.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions is principally attributable to the anticipated pro tability achieved through perceived cost and revenue synergies.
The fair value adjustments are based on an independent valuation at the time of acquisition and primarily relate to identi ed intangible assets technology, relationships and brand name deferred revenue and related deferred tax.
Allscripts contributed 127.7m revenue to the Groups revenue for the period between the date of acquisition and 31 May 2009.
If the acquisition of Allscripts had been completed on the first day of the period, the Groups pro-forma revenues for the year would be 747.8m and the Groups pro-forma operating pro t would be 135.0m.
