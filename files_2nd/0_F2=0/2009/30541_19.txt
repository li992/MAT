Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2003 revised in December 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are set out in the Business Review section of the Directors Report on pages 6 to 16.
The financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2009 is shown in the balance sheet on page 44.
The cash flows of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2009, which are not untypical, are set out on page 45.
The Company had fixed debt and preference share capital totalling 110,166,000, as set out in note 13 on page 57: none of the borrowings is repayable before 2016.
The Group has no short term borrowings or borrowing facilities.
Note 14 on pages 57 to 63 sets out the Groups risk management policies and procedures, including those covering currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
As at 31 December 2009 the Groups total assets less current liabilities exceeded its total non current liabilities by a multiple of over ten.
The assets of the Group consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on page 10.
Most of these securities are readily realisable even in the more volatile markets experienced in recent months and despite the continuing uncertain economic outlook.
The directors, who have reviewed carefully the Groups budget and forecast for the coming year, consider that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups accounts.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used by them into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
d Presentation of Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits is accrued to the end of the period.
Stock lending fees and underwriting commission are recognised as earned.
Where the Group has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the Income Statement.
46 Annual Report 2009 1 Accounting policies continued f Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fees and finance costs are allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital to reflect the Boards expectations of long term investment returns.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are included in the costs of acquisition or deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate and included in capital reserves.
g Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
h Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All the Groups investments are defined by IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
All gains and losses are allocated to the capital return within the Income Statement.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and reference to similar quoted companies.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
The subsidiary company, Witan Investment Services Limited, is held at fair value.
This is considered to be the net asset value of the shareholders funds, as shown in its balance sheet.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
47 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies continued j Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are not recognised until approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
k Non current liabilities All debentures and secured bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future payments over the expected life of the financial liabilities, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
l Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement and allocated to the capital return.

The following amendment has not had any impact on the accounting policies or the financial position of the Group or the Company.
IAS 18 Revenue: Determining whether an entity is acting as a principal or as an agent International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS for Small and Medium-sized Entities SMEs The standard was issued in July 2009 and is effective immediately.
The standard covers all of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for SMEs.
The standard cannot be applied to entities that have public accountability and therefore cannot be applied by the Group or the Company.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not effective and are not expected to have material impact on the financial position of the Group or the Company: IFRS 3 Revised 2008 Business Combinations and IAS 27 Revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements The revised standards were issued in January 2008 and become effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRS 3 Revised 2008 introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs, and future reported results.
IAS 27 Revised 2008 requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Application of the revised standards will become mandatory for the Groups 2010 financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items This amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement was issued on 31 July 2008 and is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 with early application permitted.
The amendment clarifies how the principles that determine whether a hedged risk or portion of cash flows is eligible for designation should be applied in particular situations.

The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the investment managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2008: nil.
53 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 7 Taxation continued d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 19,178,000 2008: 11,752,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
8 Dividends Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 5.90p 2007: 5.80p per ordinary share 12,629 12,849 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 4.30p 2008: 4.30p per ordinary share 9,162 9,288 21,791 22,137 Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 6.20p 2008: 5.90p per ordinary share 12,407 12,629 The second interim dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Total in respect of the year: Set out below is the total dividend to be paid in respect of the year.
This is the basis on which the requirements of section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are considered.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 000 000 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 4.30p 2008: 4.30p per ordinary share 9,162 9,288 Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 6.20p 2008: 5.90p per ordinary share 12,407 12,629 21,569 21,917 9 Earnings loss per ordinary share The earnings per ordinary share figure is based on the net profit for the year of 209,559,000 2008: loss of 279,216,000 and on 211,898,833 ordinary shares 2008: 217,695,259, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The earnings per ordinary share figure detailed above can be further analysed between revenue and capital, as below.
The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share.
Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.

v Unquoted investments The value of the unquoted investments as at 31 December 2009 was 7,095,000 2008: 3,450,000 and the portfolio comprised the following holdings: Valuation Investments 000 Cazenove Group Limited 6,375 Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited 720 7,095 Cazenove Group Limited formerly Cazenove Group plc Cazenove was established by the partners of Cazenove & Co. to incorporate the business of that firm.
It combined its investment banking business with that of JP Morgan to form JP Morgan Cazenove and, since the year end, JP Morgan has acquired the entire business, enabling the Company to realise its holding at the valuation shown.
Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited is a separate asset management business which split away from Cazenove Group in 2005.
The holding is valued on the basis of an independent valuation of the company that was used in May 2009 to set the price for a tender offer to the companys shareholders: the directors consider this price to be supported by information about the companys business over the remainder of 2009.

14 Financial instruments Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
14.1 Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2008.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
14.2 Price risk Price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by regularly reviewing relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with Witans objective.
When appropriate, Witan has the ability to manage its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity investments in its portfolios.
57 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 14 Financial instruments continued The Companys exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted and unquoted equity investments, and on options on indices and investments, was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,074,189 880,013 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on page 17.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America, Continental Europe and Japan.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Companys equity investments including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable, given that most of the Companys assets are equity investments.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The investment managers monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling upon receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the Companys equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable in the context of the majority of the Companys assets being invested overseas.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2008: 15% Euro - 15% 2008: 15% Japanese yen - 15% 2008: 15% These percentages have been determined by taking in each case the highest range seen in each of the last seven calendar years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 555 960 333 481 1,042 350 Capital return 35,868 33,379 17,282 31,229 25,867 22,212 Change to the profit after tax 36,423 34,339 17,615 31,710 26,909 22,562 Change to the shareholders funds 36,423 34,339 17,615 31,710 26,909 22,562 59 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 14 Financial instruments continued If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 410 709 246 356 770 259 Capital return 26,511 24,672 12,774 23,080 19,089 16,418 Change to the profit after tax 26,921 25,381 13,020 23,436 19,859 16,677 Change to the shareholders funds 26,921 25,381 13,020 23,436 19,859 16,677 In the opinion of the directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently, as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objective.
14.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from fixed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company holds significant cash balances, partially to meet payments as they fall due but also to offset the long term borrowings that it has in place.
The Company finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through debenture stock and secured bonds that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2009 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due be repaid.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 58,638,000 2008: 124,383,000.
The Companys exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 110,166,000 2008: 140,087,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2008: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2008: 3.3% : the finance charge on the debenture stock is at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5% 2008: 8.5% : and the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.125% 2008: 6.125%.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, long term debt is partially redeemed and as the level of cash balances varies during the year.
In the context of the Companys balance sheet, the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Companys monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would increase or decrease revenue return after tax by 845,000 2008: 1,791,000, capital return after tax by 328,000 2008: 697,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 1,173,000 2008: 2,488,000.
60 Annual Report 2009 14 Financial instruments continued This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
In the context of the Companys balance sheet, the outcome is not considered to be material.
14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December 2009, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: 2009 2008 Within Between More than Within Between More than 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 3,790 15,160 51,222 3,891 15,565 56,480 Secured bonds 3,938 15,751 107,433 5,702 22,810 161,279 Preference shares 83 332 2,555 83 332 2,555 Other creditors and accruals 5,820 4,892 13,631 31,243 161,210 14,568 38,707 220,314 The above figures show interest payable over the remaining terms of each instrument.
The figures in the more than 5 years column also include the capital to be repaid.
"The figures in the ""more than 5 years"" columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 83,000."
14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due dates or impaired.
14.7 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Except for those financial liabilities measured at amortised cost that are shown below, the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, amounts due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and bank overdrafts.

Note 1 h on page 47 sets out the Boards policy for determining the fair values of the unquoted investments.
The directors are of the opinion that changing one or more of those assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change those fair values significantly.
The amount of change in fair value for such investments recognised in the profit or loss for the year was a profit of 3,645,000 2008: loss of 16,723,000.
Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2009 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 993,194 7,095 1,000,289 Investments in other funds 73,900 73,900 Derivatives 194 194 Total 993,388 73,900 7,095 1,074,383 Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 h. There were no transfers during the year between Level 1 and Level 2.
A reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.
Level 2 Financial assets Level 2 Financial assets refer to two Open Ended Investment Company investments managed by Henderson Global Investors North America and Orbis Investment Management Australasia.

The Companys policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to not normally exceed 20%.
Effective gearing is defined to be the total market value of investments less shareholders funds as a percentage of shareholders funds.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Officers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price i. e. the level of share price discount or premium : and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the terms of issue of the Companys debenture stock and secured bonds require the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of borrowings, measured in accordance with the policies used to prepare the annual financial statements, not to exceed a sum equal to the Companys capital and reserves at any time: as a public company, the Company has a minimum issued share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.

cumulative preference shares constitute a single class and confer the right, in priority to any other class of shares: i to receive a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the respective rates exclusive of tax credit thereon of 3.4 per cent.
per annum, such dividend being payable half-yearly on 15 January and 15 July in each year, in respect of the 3.4 per cent.
cumulative preference shares, and on 1 February and 1 August in each year, in respect of the 2.7 per cent.
cumulative preference shares: and ii to receive repayment of capital at par in a winding up of the Company but do not confer any further right to participate in profits or assets.
The preference shareholders are entitled to receive notices of general meetings of the Company but are not entitled to attend or vote thereat except on a resolution for the voluntary liquidation of the Company or for any alteration to the objects of the Company as set out in its Memorandum of Association.
In the event of a poll at a general meeting of the Company, every member of the Company who is present in person or by proxy and who is entitled to vote thereat, whether an ordinary shareholder or, in the circumstances outlined above, a preference shareholder, has one vote for every 1 nominal value of shares registered in their name.
Accordingly, on a poll each ordinary shareholder has one vote for every four shares held.
18 Net asset value per ordinary share The net asset value per ordinary share is based on the net assets attributable to the ordinary shares of 1,022,819,000 2008: 879,247,000 and on the 203,464,280 ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2009 2008: 214,398,654.
The movements during the year of the net assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows: 000 Total net assets at 1 January 2009 879,247 Total profit for the year 209,559 Dividends paid in the year on the ordinary shares see note 8 21,791 Buy-backs of ordinary shares 44,196 Net assets attributable to the ordinary shares at 31 December 2009 1,022,819 An alternative net asset value per ordinary share can be calculated by deducting from the total assets less current liabilities of the Company the preference shares, the debenture stock and the secured bonds at their market or fair values rather than at their par or book values.
Details of the alternative values are set out in note 14.7.
The net asset value per ordinary share at 31 December 2009 calculated on this basis is 497.0p 2008: 400.3p.

22 Subsidiary undertaking The Company has an investment in the issued ordinary share capital of its wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, Witan Investment Services Limited, which was incorporated on 28 October 2004, is registered in England and Wales and operates in the United Kingdom.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiary, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
23 Segment Reporting The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer and that are used to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The identification of the Groups reportable segments has not changed as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8.
Geographical segments Geographical segments are considered to be the primary reporting segment.
An analysis of investment income by geographical segment is set out in note 2 on page 50.
Analyses of expenses by geographical segment and of profit by geographical segment have not been given as it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way.
An analysis of the investments by geographical segment is set out in note 10 on page 55.
Analyses of the remaining assets and liabilities by geographical region have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.

On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgement on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies in respect of much, but not all, of the period from 1 January 1990 to the point in 2007 from which VAT ceased to be applied to investment management fees.
Henderson Global Investors Limited Henderson, which was the Companys sole investment manager until 2004 and has been one of the Companys investment managers since 2004, has now been able, on behalf of the Company, to reclaim from HMRC the VAT borne, together with simple interest thereon.
Similarly, the Company has been able to recover the VAT borne in respect of its other investment management contracts.
An aggregate amount of 2,015,000, in respect of the VAT on investment management fees borne by the Company in the period from October 2000 to 2007, was written back in the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2008.
An amount of 1,249,000, in respect of the period from 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996, has been written back in the year ended 31 December 2009.
These amounts have been received in full by the Company and represent all the VAT on investment management fees borne by the Company in respect of the two periods.
The write-backs of VAT have been allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
The Company has also received from Henderson the interest paid by HMRC on the amounts of VAT that it recovered.
Interest totalling 207,000 was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2008 and a further 984,000 has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2009.
These amounts have been received in full by the Company and are included in other income.
