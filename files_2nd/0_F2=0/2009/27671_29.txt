The statement reconciles adjusted operating profit to profit after tax as reported under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
For core life assurance and general insurance businesses, adjusted operating profit is based on a long-term investment return, including investment returns on life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.
For the US Asset Management business it includes compensation costs in respect of certain long-term incentive schemes defined as non-controlling interests in accordance with IFRS.
For all core businesses, adjusted operating profit excludes goodwill impairment, the impact of acquisition accounting, revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes, the impact of closure of unclaimed shares trusts, profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments, dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities, and fair value profits losses on certain Group debt movements.
Bermuda, which is non-core, is not included in adjusted operating profit.
Adjusted operating earnings per ordinary share is calculated on the same basis as adjusted operating profit.
It is stated after tax attributable to adjusted operating profit and non-controlling interests.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.
