The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 3,213,000 2008: 13,872,000.
Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
Where the consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking includes shares in the Company to which the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 apply, cost represents the nominal value of the shares issued together with the fair value of any additional consideration given and costs.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, floors and ceilings, is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and options is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Hedging Cash Flow Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised as profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other cases, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Cash Flow Statement As the ultimate holding company of the Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Group, the Company has relied upon the exemption in FRS 1 Revised not to present a cash flow statement as part of its financial statements.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Companys Shareholders or, in the case of an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.

ii Share-based Payment Transactions The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The Company also operates an Executive Incentive Plan and a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and senior Executives.

The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares or options the vesting period.
The fair value of the shares or options granted is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares or options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account is adjusted to take into account an estimate of the number of shares or options that are expected to vest together with an adjustment to reflect the number of shares or options that actually do vest except where forfeiture is only due to market-based conditions not being achieved.
The fair values of grants under the Executive Incentive Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The fair values of options granted under all other share option schemes have been determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of share-based payments at the date of exercise are treated as cash-settled awards and revalued to market price at each balance sheet date.

Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.

Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse and is provided in respect of all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
