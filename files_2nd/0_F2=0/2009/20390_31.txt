The Authorised Share Capital was replaced by the creation of an unlimited number of Unclassied Shares as dened in the Companys amended Articles of Incorporation at no par value.
The Company is a closed-ended investment company with an unlimited life.
The Redeemable Participating Preference Shares are not puttable instruments because redemption is conditional upon certain market conditions and or Board approval.
As such they are not required to be classied as debt under IAS 32.
IFRIC Interpretation 2: Members Shares in Co-operative Entities and Similar Instruments paragraph 7 states Members share is equity if the entity has an unconditional right to refuse redemption of the members share.
As dened in the Articles of Association, redemption of Redeemable Participating Preference Shares is at the sole discretion of the Directors, therefore the Redeemable Participating Preference Shares have been classied as equity.
In the event that the Companys Shares trade at a discount of more than 5.0 per cent.
at each monthly Net Asset Value calculation date over the course of a full financial year, there is a provision for a resolution to be put to the members at the Annual General Meeting for a termination of the Company continuation vote.
It has not been the case that a discount of more than 5.0 per cent.
has persisted during the year to 31st March 2009 and as a consequence, no such continuation vote will occur.
In the event that a discount of greater than 5.0 per cent.
prevails during the year to 31st March 2010, a continuation vote may be raised at the following Annual General Meeting after 31st March 2010.
The Board also has the discretion to operate the Redemption Facility, offering shareholders the possibility of redeeming part of their shareholding at the Net Asset Value, if it appears appropriate to do so.
The Company operates a Share Buyback Programme whereby it may purchase, subject to various terms as set out in its Articles and in accordance with The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008, up to 14.99 per cent.
of its existing Share Capital following the admission of the Shares to trading on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities.
Founder Shares were issued for administrative purposes and were fully cancelled during the year.
