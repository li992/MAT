The Group undertook a review in the prior year and the significant downturn in the UK housing market in early 2008 as well as the continued deterioration in the US market led to the Group performing a full impairment test on intangible assets at 30 June 2008.
As a result, the Group fully impaired all remaining goodwill, brands and software development costs.
The Group has evaluated its performance in the current year and concluded that it would not be appropriate to reverse any of the previously recognised impairment charges.
