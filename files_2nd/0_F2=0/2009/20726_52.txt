In pursuing these objectives the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends.
The principal financial instruments at risk comprise those in the Companys investment portfolio and this note addresses these risks below.
The Group has certain additional risks, and these are detailed in the appropriate sections below.
These risks and the Directors approach to managing them are set out below under the following headings: market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
The Group has a risk management framework in place which is described in detail on pages 24 and 25.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks have not changed from the previous accounting period, save for any changes caused by the use of derivative financial instruments in the year.
Further information in relation to their use is given in note 23.4.
23.1 Market Risk Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk see note 23.2, interest rate risk see note 23.3 and price risk see note 23.4.
Market risk is managed on a regular basis by the AAC.
The purpose of this Executive Committee is to manage the capital of the Company within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Companys strategy on investment risk is outlined in our statement of investment objectives and policy on the inside cover unaudited.
Details of the investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed on pages 11 to 21.
In the course of 2008 the Board approved a derivatives policy and during the year to 31 January 2009 the Company entered into three derivative transactions.
Further details are given in note 23.4.
23.2 Currency Risk Some of the Groups assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency of sterling.
Consequently the Group is exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Groups currency holdings and gains losses are reviewed regularly by the Directors, and the currency risk is managed on a regular basis by the AAC within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The currency exposure for overseas investments is based on the quotation currency of each holding, while the currency exposure for net monetary assets is based on the currency that each asset or liability is denominated in.
At the reporting date the Group had the following exposures: report back original.

23.3 Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in a number of ways.
A movement in interest rates may affect the fair value of investments in fixed interest rate securities, income receivable on cash deposits and interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which are approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows as a result of an interest rate change are taken into account when making investment or borrowing decisions.
The Company has a financial services subsidiary, Alliance Trust Savings Ltd, which holds client deposits and pays interest on these.
This subsidiary has detailed risk management policies, with treasury and cash management undertaken within a framework of banking policies.
These banking policies cover credit risk, counterparty exposure, capital adequacy and liquidity.
The Alliance Trust Savings Management Committee reviews interest rate risk on a regular basis.

As the majority of the Groups financial assets are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect investment income and net assets.
The Directors manage price risk by having a suitable investment objective for the Company.
The Board reviews this objective and investment performance regularly.
The risk is managed on a regular basis by the AAC within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
As mentioned in Note 23.1 above, the AAC now also has the ability to use derivatives to manage other price risk.
In the year to 31 January 2009 the Company entered into three such derivative transactions based on forward options on the S&P 500, resulting in a total gain of 2,794,000.
There were no open positions at the year end.
