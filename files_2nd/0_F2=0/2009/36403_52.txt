The finances of the Group, its liquidity position, borrowing facilities and applicable covenants are described in Our financial position on pages 26 to 29 and in note 14 of the accounts on pages 79 to 81.
The current economic conditions have created a number of risks and uncertainties for the Group, these are set out in Risk management on pages 32 and 33.
In particular, there is uncertainty over future market-driven valuation movements which may affect the Groups ability to remain within its bank covenants.
The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group, making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance, valuation projections and debt requirements.
In making this assessment, we have taken into account available market information, consulted with our advisers and applied our own knowledge and experience to the Groups property portfolio and markets.
We have considered the potential to achieve further property disposals should valuations fall significantly ahead of market expectations from the 31 March 2009 position and on 19 May 2009, the Company announced a fully underwritten Rights Issue which is expected to raise additional equity of 166.4 million after expenses providing further financial flexibility.
On the basis of this review, and after making due enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.
