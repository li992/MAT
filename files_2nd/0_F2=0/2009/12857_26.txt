The rate on this credit exceeds the overall Group tax rate as it primarily relates to tax on items subject to the higher US tax rate.
Factors affecting future tax charges The effective tax rate continues to be below the statutory rate in the UK primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development relief in the UK.
The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any future tax legislation changes.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 33.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.
Underlying basic earnings per share figures are presented below in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share as the Directors consider this gives a more relevant indication of underlying business performance and reflects the adjustments to basic earnings per share for the impact of specific non-recurring items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and tax thereon.

In the year the CGUs were re-aligned to reflect the way in which the Groups businesses are managed and operated.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and staff knowledge, expertise, customer contacts and security clearances.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount on a value in use basis using discounted future cash flows.
The discounted future cash flows are based on forecasts from the five-year corporate plan.
Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the final year of the corporate plan, with a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Key assumptions are as follows: Growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of between 2.5% and 3.0%.
Growth rates are formed based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer-term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied adjusted for risks specific to the geographical location of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
The discount rate applied for QNA CGUs was 10.3% and a range from 10.4%-12.9% for EMEA CGUs.
The goodwill allocated to the Technology Solutions business, Systems Engineering business and Mission Solutions business are considered significant as, on an individual basis, they represent more than 10% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value.
After translation, using year-end foreign exchange rates, these CGUs have 119.2m, 188.2m and 289.8m of goodwill respectively.
When aggregated, these three CGUs represent 93.4% of the total balance: no other amounts are considered individually significant.
Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key components on the outcome of the recoverable amount.
The following table shows, for each of the three individually significant CGUs, the movement in assumptions which could trigger an impairment: Discount rate at Terminal growth rate at Recoverable amount headroom with which goodwill which goodwill carrying Goodwill carrying value current assumptions carrying value exceeds value exceeds recoverable CGU m m recoverable amount amount Technology Solutions 119.2 398.4 24.6% -57.2% Systems Engineering 188.2 159.0 15.2% -6.3% Mission Solutions 289.8 184.7 13.6% -3.0% The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions since the 31 March 2009 and the signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

The fund was accounted for as a joint venture with a 50% economic interest held by the Group but with the potential for an increase to 75% dependent on the future financial results of the fund.
The Group invested cash of 6.4m 2008: 3.5m into the fund during the year and there were losses of 7.2m 2008: 4.2m recorded in the income statement.
On 27 March 2009 the Group disposed of part of its interest in Cody Gate Ventures I LP to Coller Capital resulting in the Group receiving cash consideration of 13.7m and reducing its interest to 25% formerly 50% economic interest.
The Group has also relinquished its voting powers over the fund and forgone its rights to vote to remove the General Partner and in light of these changes it is no longer considered that the Group has any significant influence over the fund and therefore the remaining investment is now disclosed as an available for sale investment.
The changes permit QinetiQ to be entitled to take an increased economic interest of up to 50% above certain thresholds of realisation.
The Group reported a profit on the disposal of 9.5m see note 5 for further details and disclosed its remaining 25% interest in the fund at a fair value of 4.7m as an available for sale investment in other non current investments see note 17.

Interest rate risk management The majority of the Group's bank and private placement borrowings were fixed or capped through a combination of interest rate swaps, collars and fixed rate debt.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was 188.1m or $270m 31 March 2008: 135.7m or $270m.
The swaps have the economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
C Currency risk The table below shows the Group's currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.

The loans bear interest at a variable margin over LIBOR of between 0.30% and 0.50% dependent on the ratio of EBITDA to net debt and the level of utilisation.
H Sensitivity and analysis The Groups sensitivity to changes in market rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2009 is set out in the table overleaf.
The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1 per cent 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2009, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10 per cent weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2009, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

25% of options will vest if EPS growth is 22.5% for the period and 100% will vest if growth is at least 52%.
No options will vest if EPS growth is below 22.5%.
Options will vest on a straight line basis if EPS growth is between 22.5% and 52%.
For the remaining 173,071 2008: 411,876 options the EPS growth target is replaced by a performance target based on QinetiQs ranking by reference to total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of FTSE listed companies over a three-year performance period such that a below median ranking will result in nil shares vesting, at the median level 30% of the options would vest and the amount vested will increase on a straight line basis such that 100% would vest if TSR reaches the upper quartile of the ranking over a three-year period.

The awards vest over 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 4 years.
Half of the awards are dependent on achieving QNA organic profit growth targets and half on a time based criteria.

Share based award pricing Share options excluding TSR performance related and awards under the deferred annual bonus plan have been valued using Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of awards.
Assumptions used within the model were as follows for awards in each year: 2008 Share price at date of grant pence 198.5p 174.0p Exercise price pence 198.5p 174.0p Volatility % 31% 22% Average expected term to exercise 3 years 3 years Risk-free rate % 4.3% 5.5% Expected dividend yield % 2.2% 2.1% The average share price in the year was 179.7p 2008: 186.0p.
com 100 Business Review Governance Financial Statements The expected volatility assumption is based on the average historic volatility of QinetiQs share price at the date of grant commensurate with the vesting period to the extent possible.
Share based awards involving market based performance conditions, including those based on TSR, have used Monte Carlo models to determine the fair value at grant date.
Assumptions used in these models included 32% for the average share price volatility of the FTSE comparator group and 33% for the average correlation to comparator group.
The fair value for these awards before the probability of lapsing in the year ended March 2009 was 119.1p.
Share based awards that vest based upon non-market performance conditions, including certain PSP, RSUs and Deferred Annual Bonus awards have been valued at the share price at grant less attrition.
For the 2003 Share Option Scheme, there was a pre-bonus issue weighted average share price of 1 and a weighted average exercise price of 1 based on third-party transactions in the Companys shares in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options.
Prior to IPO in February 2006 there was no active market for the Companys shares therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses.
At this time the Group had no established pattern of dividend payments therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.
Operating leases Group as a lessor The Group receives rental income on certain properties.
The Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments: all figures in million 2008 Within one year 6.3 8.1 In the second to fifth years inclusive 11.5 19.1 Greater than five years 17.8 27.2 Group as a lessee all figures in million 2008 Lease and sublease income statement expense minimum lease payments 18.9 16.6 The Group had the following future minimum lease payment commitments: all figures in million 2008 Within one year 17.3 13.8 In the second to fifth years inclusive 52.5 36.7 Greater than five years 22.7 25.4 92.5 75.9 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group on certain office property and plant.

Transactions with MOD continued Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties Under the terms of the Group's acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.
These are: i Restrictions on transfer of title The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets see below include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of MOD.
The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.
ii Property clawback agreement The MOD retains an interest in future profits on disposal following a trigger event.
A trigger event includes the granting of planning permission for development and or change of use, and the disposition of any of the acquired land and buildings.
During the 12 years from 1 July 2001, following a trigger event, the MOD is entitled to clawback a proportion of the gain on each individual property transaction in excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation.
The proportion of the excess gain due to the MOD is based on a sliding scale which reduces over time from 50% to 9% and at 31 March 2009 stands at 33% 2008: 37%.
The July 2001 valuation was approximately 16% greater in aggregate than the consideration paid for the land and buildings on 1 July 2001.
Compliance Regime The Compliance Committee monitors the effective application of the Compliance Regime required by the MOD to maintain the position of QinetiQ as a supplier of independent and impartial scientific technical advice to the MOD and ensures that the required standards are met in trials involving human volunteers.
Strategic assets Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: i dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset: or ii voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2009 was 2.7m 31 March 2008: 2.9m, the principal items being plant and machinery.

Contingent liabilities and assets Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 8.5m at 31 March 2009 31 March 2008: 5.8m in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is aware of claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the MOD and DERA and contractors, in respect of intellectual property, employment rights and industrial illness and injury which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group.

The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005.
Additional consideration, subject to clawback to the MOD pursuant to the arrangements referred to in note 36, is potentially due upon the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.

Post-retirement benefits Triennial funding valuation The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2008 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 111.3m.
On the basis of this full valuation the Trustees of the scheme and the Company agreed that the current 17.5% employer contribution rate will change to 11.5%, back-dated to 30 June 2008, and there will be deficit recovery payments of 13m per year for a 10 year period.
Introduction and background to IAS 19 International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit on defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date.
It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries.
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees, a mixed benefit scheme.
The Defined Benefit DB section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees.
All Group employees who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of schemes who are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club.
On 31 March 2009, the Group withdrew from the Public Sector Transfer Club from 31 March 2009.
The Defined Contribution DC section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB section of the scheme.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group operates a further two small defined benefit schemes, QinetiQ Prudential Platinum Scheme and a scheme for the subsidiary company ASAP Calibration Limited.
The net pension deficits of these schemes at 31 March 2009 amounted to 0.2m 31 March 2008: 0.2m.
The defined benefit scheme relating to ASAP Calibration Limited was closed to future benefit accruals in the year to 31 March 2007.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date March 2008: nil.
Set out below is a summary of the overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes liabilities.
The fair value of the schemes' assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were: all figures in million 2008 2007 2006 Equities 473.7 620.8 641.5 551.1 Corporate bonds 78.4 83.9 74.5 85.2 Government bonds 83.2 76.3 74.7 74.8 Cash 12.1 3.2 3.4 4.9 Total market value of assets 647.4 784.2 794.1 716.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 752.6 807.6 884.9 884.4 Net pension liability before deferred tax 105.2 23.4 90.8 168.4 Deferred tax asset 29.4 6.5 27.1 50.4 Net pension liability 75.8 16.9 63.7 118.0 Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% 5.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1% 3.5% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 3.1% 3.5% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.5% 6.6% Inflation assumption 3.1% 3.5% Assumed life expectancies in years Future male pensioners currently aged 60 87 87 Future female pensioners currently aged 60 89 90 Future male pensioners currently aged 40 89 88 Future female pensioners currently aged 40 90 91 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 57 103 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 39.
Post-retirement benefits continued The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators.
In light of evidence of changes in life expectancy the assumptions for mortality have changed in the year to 31 March 2009 so that the base tables for mortality have been updated to reflect the latest standard actuarial tables and the allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is now in line with the Medium Cohort projections with minimum annual rates of improvement of 1% for males and 0.5% for females 2008: no underpin for future improvement.
The current mortality rates reflect the standard tables PNMA00MC for males and PNFA00MC for females for members' year of birth.
These mortality tables are published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession.
Scheme assets The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon the expected return rates for each asset class.
Equity return rates are the long term expected return rates based upon the market rates of return for risk free investments, typically government bonds, together with the historical level of risk premium associated with equities: with the resulting rate then being reviewed and benchmarked against a peer group of listed companies.
Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets weighted to reflect the individual scheme actual asset allocations were: 2008 Equities 8.0% 7.7% Corporate bonds 6.0% 6.2% Government bonds 3.8% 4.4% Cash 4.0% 6.0% Weighted average 7.1% 7.2% Return on scheme assets all figures in million 2008 Actual return on plan assets: Expected return on scheme assets 56.5 56.8 Actuarial loss on scheme assets 212.8 84.0 Actual loss on scheme assets 156.3 27.2 Value of scheme assets all figures in million 2008 Changes to the fair value of scheme assets: Opening fair value of scheme assets 784.2 794.1 Expected return on assets 56.5 56.8 Actuarial loss 212.8 84.0 Contributions by the employer 37.3 32.3 Contributions by plan participants 1.3 6.5 Scheme disposal Aurix Limited 1.5 Net benefits paid out and transfers 19.1 20.0 Closing fair value of scheme assets 647.4 784.2 Changes to the present value of the defined benefit obligation all figures in million 2008 Opening defined benefit obligation 807.6 884.9 Current service cost 26.8 38.9 Interest cost 53.1 48.4 Contributions by plan participants 1.3 6.5 Actuarial gains on scheme liabilities 117.1 149.5 Scheme disposal Aurix Limited 1.6 Net benefits paid out and transfers 19.1 20.0 Closing defined benefit obligation 752.6 807.6 Total expense recognised in the income statement all figures in million 2008 Pension costs charged to the income statement: Current service cost 26.8 38.9 Interest cost 53.1 48.4 Expected return on plan assets 56.5 56.8 Total expense recognised in the income statement gross of deferred tax 23.4 30.5 45 www.
