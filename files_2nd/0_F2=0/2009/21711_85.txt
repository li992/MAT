BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued a Price Risk continued If the net asset value of AllBlue had been 10% lower with all other variables held constant, the net assets attributable to shareholders for the year would have been 43,976,086 2008: 28,141,240 lower, arising due to the decrease in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The sensitivity is higher in 2009 than in 2008 because of an increase in the net financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at the statement of financial position date.
b Credit Risk The nature of commercial arrangements made in the normal course of business between many prime brokers and custodians means that in the case of any one prime broker or custodian defaulting on its obligations to AllBlue or any of the underlying funds, the effects of such a default may have negative effects on other prime brokers with whom AllBlue or such underlying fund deals.
The underlying funds and, by extension, AllBlue and the Company may, therefore be exposed to systemic risk when AllBlue or an underlying fund deals with prime brokers and custodians whose creditworthiness may be interlinked.
The assets of AllBlue and the underlying funds may be pledged as margin with prime brokers or other counterparties or held with prime brokers or banks.
In the event of the default of any of these prime brokers, banks or counterparties, AllBlue or the underlying funds may not receive back all or any of the assets pledged or held with the defaulting party.
The maximum credit risk to which the Company was exposed at the year end was 440,591,790 2008: 282,292,472.
The main concentration of risk for the Company relates to the investments in AllBlue, as these are the only investments the Company has.
c Liquidity Risk In some circumstances, investments may be relatively illiquid making it difficult to acquire or dispose of them at the prices quoted on the various exchanges.
Accordingly, an underlying funds ability to respond to market movements may be impaired and, consequently, the underlying fund may experience adverse price movements upon liquidation of its investments which may in turn affect the value of AllBlue and hence the Companys investment in AllBlue.
Settlement of transactions may be subject to delay and administrative formalities.
