Tax charges are calculated by applying the statutory tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to the profit before tax for each entity.
The sum of the tax charges for each entity is then divided by the Group accounting profit before tax to derive the weighted average rate of corporation tax for the year.
The weighted average rate of corporation tax has changed from the previous accounting period due to differences in the weighted average mix of profits in each tax jurisdiction.
c Unrecognised tax losses The Group has unrecognised tax losses which arose in Egypt of 35,953,000 2008: 46,192,000 in respect of exploration activities outside the ring-fence, that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that the asset is recoverable.
The asset is recoverable if there were future suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
d Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 December 2009, no deferred tax liability 2008: Nil has been recognised in respect of taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the near future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not been recognised aggregated to nil 2008: 738,000.
The temporary differences have reduced to nil from the previous year as a result of a change to UK legislation which largely exempts dividends received after 1 July 2009 from UK tax.
