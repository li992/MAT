Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of non-recourse debt and the Groups corporate facility, and includes the borrowings, disclosed in note 22, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 30 to 33.
The Group aims to deliver its objective by investing available cash and using leverage whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet on-going expenses and dividend payments.
The Groups investment policy is set out on pages 11 to 14 of the Annual Report.
Gearing ratio 77 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Groups Investment Advisor reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis.
As part of this review, the Investment Advisor considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
As stated in the initial public offering prospectus, the Group has committed to a maximum gearing ratio of 50% excluding non-recourse project level debt as the proportion of recourse debt to portfolio valuation.
As at the date of this Annual Report all debt was non-recourse project level debt with the exception of the corporate debt facility which is secured over all the assets of the Company.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.

These risks include: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and nonderivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
In line with the lending requirements under project agreements for PFI PPP type investments there is generally a requirement for the underlying project entity to either enter a fixed rate loan agreement for the life of the concession or, if a variable interest rate loan is agreed, an interest rate swap agreement will be entered into at the commencement of the loan.
The effect of the interest rate swap is to mitigate any interest rate risk that the underlying project entity may be exposed to.
As a result, the group has minimal exposure to any change in interest rates.
The Group may also enter forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk.
Sensitivities around the Groups exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rates are detailed in the note below.
There has been no change during the year to the manner in which the Group manages and measures the risks.
Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts based on the expected timing of these.
Generally, the Group intends to cover forward foreign exchange payments and receipts for up to a four-year period.
As at 31 December 2009 the Group had entered into foreign exchange contracts in accordance with the Groups Treasury Policy.
79 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The following table details the forward foreign currency FC contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2009 2008: nil : Average exchange rate Foreign Notional value Outstanding contracts currency Fair value 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 Cash flow hedges Buy pound sterling Less than 12 months 1.0000 9,216 9,216 497 1 to 4 years 1.0000 15,227 15,227 783 Outstanding contracts Average Fair value exchange rate Local currency Notional value 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 Sell Euro Less than 12 months 1.1377 2,897 2,547 27 1 to 4 years 1.1323 5,282 4,661 67 Sell Canadian dollars Less than 12 months 1.7950 1,827 1,018 56 1 to 4 years 1.7959 4,051 2,256 124 Sell Australian dollars Less than 12 months 1.9894 11,223 5,651 414 1 to 4 years 2.1072 17,338 8,310 592 Forward foreign exchange liability 1,280 Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Currency risk arises in financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
Currency risk does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or from financial instruments denominated in the functional currency.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments at the reporting date are set out in the table below: 80 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Liabilities Assets 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2009 2008 2009 2008 000s 000s 000s 000s Euro - - 26,224 19,420 Canadian dollar - - - 8,396 Australian dollar - - 6 5,342 In the current year these balances relate to monetary loans to subsidiaries and in the prior year, these represented cash balances held predominantly to cover future equity investments in these currencies.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the following countries: Australia AUD dollar currency Canada CAD dollar currency Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and Germany Euro currency.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis below includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates against sterling.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit and other equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be positive.
Euro currency AUD dollar currency CAD dollar currency impact impact impact 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Profit or loss before tax 2,384 1,765 1 486 - 763 The reasons for the foreign currency impacts are the exposure of the Group to foreign exchange fluctuations as a result of holding multi currency financial instruments.
In managements opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk, as the year end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
In addition, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rate at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the translation reserve.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies for foreign operations.
The sensitivity table adjusts for the exchange 81 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued rates prevailing at the balance date as applied to the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations and the average rate for the year applied to the income and expense items for a 10% change in foreign currency rates against Sterling.
A positive number below indicates an increase in net assets and profit where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on net assets and profit, and the balances below would be negative.
Euro currency AUD dollar currency CAD dollar currency impact impact impact 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Impact on net assets 349 1,507 1,532 275 547 5,192 Impact on profit 365 133 4 226 315 202 Interest rate risk management The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk as the underlying borrowings within the Group are either fixed rate loans or an interest rate swap agreement is entered to mitigate any fluctuations in interest rates.
It is generally a requirement under a PFI PPP concession that any borrowings are matched against the life of the concession.
Hedging activities are aligned with the period of the loan, which also mirrors the concession period and are highly effective.
Therefore, the Group is not exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates over its variable rate borrowings.
The fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost and hence not exposed to fair value movements due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups exposures to interest rate movements on financial assets are detailed in the interest rate sensitivity analysis section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
A 0.5% 2008: 0.5% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
The Groups available for sale financial assets comprise service concession financial assets that fall within the following categories and have the following values: Available for sale financial assets under construction, not exposed to interest rate risk 548.4 million Available for sale financial assets where construction is completed exposed to interest rate risk 289.9 million Listed and unlisted equity investments not exposed to interest rate risk 27.7 million The Groups loans and receivable financial assets comprise fixed rate financial assets that are being carried at amortised cost and hence not exposed to fair value movements due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups derivative financial instruments and certain available for sale financial assets are exposed to fair value movements due to changes in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 2008 would not be materially impacted as the interest rate risk associated with floating rate liabilities has been mitigated through interest rate SWAP agreements with the exception of the corporate facility where a decrease or increase of 0.5% would result in an increase or decrease in profit of 291,000 2008: 132,000 : and 82 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued net assets and other equity reserves would increase decrease by 54.4 million 41.9 million 2008: increase decrease by 58.4 million 43.1 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of the interest rate SWAP agreements, if the interest rate was 0.5% higher lower.
While the directors note that due to interest rate movements in the year the valuation of interest rate swaps have moved by 56 million 2008: 141 million, in their opinion interest rates are unlikely to change by more than plus or minus 50 basis points over the next year, which has therefore been used in this sensitivity analysis.
A sensitivity analysis for monetary assets at 31 December 2009 using a 0.5% increase and a 0.5% decrease in the average interest rate would result in an increase in profit of 4.2 million 2008: 5.8 million and a decrease of 4.2 million 2008: 4.4 million respectively.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the interest rate yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges floating to fixed rate debt Average Outstanding receive floating Fair value contract fixed interest Notional principal pay fixed rate amount liability contracts 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Total 4.61 4.76 592,281 436,981 85,008 141,150 All interest rate swap contracts exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts.
These are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
Other price risks The Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from equity investments.
Investments in listed equity securities present the Group with opportunity for return through dividend income and trading gains.
All equity investments are designated as available for sale and are held for strategic rather than trading purposes.
The Group does not actively trade these investments.
As these movements all go through the statement of changes in equity there is no impact on the income statement when the equity prices change.
If the price of the listed equity had been 5% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant as at 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Groups net assets and equity reserves would increase decrease by 277,186 2008: increase decrease by 160,000 and the impairment charge in the income statement would have been decreased increased by 277,186 2008: nil.
83 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and PFI PPP concessions are entered into with government or semi government authorities.
Receivables consist of a small number of government or semi government counterparties that are spread across an increasingly diverse geographical area.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single non government or semi government counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on liquid funds, cash held on deposit and financial instruments.
The Group mitigates this risk by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies currently with Moodys ranging between Aa1 and A1.
The Group has considered the creditworthiness of facilities managers and construction sub-contractors and the availability of alternative sub-contractors in the event of default and Group policy is only to deal with creditworthy contractors.
Refer to note 22 for further details on the corporate debt facility.
As at 31 December 2009 the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets represents the carrying amount of 2.2 billion 2008: 1.9 billion as disclosed earlier in this note.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
In May 2008, the Group entered into a corporate debt facility in order to allow the Group greater flexibility in respect of accepting investment opportunities as they arise.
As at 31 December 2009 the Group had drawn down 58.3m of the 100m facility.
Liquidity risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

The following table details the Groups expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets.
The tables below have been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned on those assets except where the Group anticipates that the cash flow will occur in a different period.
85 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the reporting date.
For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the reporting date.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
Financial assets in this category include equity shares.
The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market data.
Except as detailed in the following table, the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values: Carrying amount Fair value 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2009 2008 2009 2008 000s 000s 000s 000s 86 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Financial assets Loans and receivables 474,467 494,339 557,504 580,847 Financial liabilities Bank loans at fixed interest rates 315,085 302,587 476,109 376,755 Assumptions used in determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of the Groups loans and receivables has been determined using discounted cash flow methodology.
In determining the discount rate, consideration is given to a number of market factors including but not limited to the prevailing risk free rate, an appropriate project specific risk premium and recent transactions that have similar characteristics.
At 31 December 2009 for project debt which is non recourse to the group covenants are in respect of historic and future interest cover ratios in the range of 1.01 times historic interest cover ratio and 1.75 times future interest cover ratio.
The fair value of the fixed rate bank loans has been calculated using discounted cash flow methodology.
The discount rate used reflects changes in the LIBOR rates and lending margins.
At 31 December 2009, the weighted average range of discount rates applied was 2.7% to 5.9% 2008: 2.7% to 5.2%.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Available-for-sale financial assets 5,546 - 860,447 865,993 Total 5,546 - 860,447 865,993 Derivative financial liabilities - 86,288 - 86,288 Total - 86,288 - 86,288 There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.

There were no financial liabilities subsequently measured at fair value on Level 3 fair value measurement bases.
All gain and losses included in other comprehensive income relate to unlisted equities held at the balance sheet date.
Significant assumptions used in determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities Unlisted shares The financial statements include holdings in unlisted shares which are measured at fair value note 19.
Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model, which includes some assumptions that are not supportable by observable market prices or rates.
In determining the fair value a risk adjusted discount factor of 12.13% 2008: 10.72% is used.
If these inputs to the valuation model were 0.5% higher lower while all the other variables were held constant, the carrying amount of the shares would decrease increase by 0.7 million 2008: decrease increase by 2.7 million.
