Financial Statements 64 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Presentation of Financial Statements Compliance with Applicable Law and IFRS The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and related interpretations.
Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets, xed rate bonds and fide ned bene t pension obligations that have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise indicated.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 3 Revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 15 Arrangement for Construction of real estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers The management is evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of above standards and interpretations will have on its financial reporting and disclosures.
Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting.
The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration the Groups current and forecast nancing postion, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern section of the Directors Report.
Reclassi cation The Income Statement for the year ended 31 March 2009 has been structured such that net exchange losses on borrowings and capital creditors are separately recognised on the face of the Income Statement.
The comparatives have been restated accordingly, with additional detail provided in note 7.
There is no impact of such reclassi cation on net income or on reserves.
Parent Company Financial Statements The financial statements of the parent company, Vedanta Resources plc, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, UK accounting presentation and UK company law.
The Company Balance Sheet is presented in note 40.
2 a Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls.
This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to govern a companys financial and operating policies so as to bene t from its activities or where the Group owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a companys equity voting rights unless in exceptional circumstances it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist in line with Group policy.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised pro ts arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Revenue Recognition Revenue represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting discounts, volume rebates, outgoing sales taxes and duties, and are recognised usually when all signi cant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer and the commodity has been delivered to the shipping agent.
Revenues from sale of material by-products are included in revenue.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 65 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 2 a Accounting Policies continued Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis in the Income Statement.
Certain of our sales contracts provide for provisional pricing based on the price on The London Metal Exchange Limited LME, as speci ed in the contract, when shipped.
Final settlement of the prices is based on the applicable price for a speci ed future period.
The Companys provisionally priced sales are marked to market using the relevant forward prices for the future period speci ed in the contract and same is adjusted in revenue.
Special Items Special items are those items that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be disclosed separately to ensure that the financial information also allows an understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The determination as to which items should be disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement.
Business Combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
The acquirers identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the Balance Sheet.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and leases, that amount is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as mining properties and leases.
Other excess purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually.
Where the fair values of the identi able assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the surplus is credited to the Income Statement in the period of acquisition.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are nalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries, where there is no change in control, the Group recognises a reduction to the minority interest of the respective subsidiary with the difference between this gure and the cash paid, inclusive of transaction fees, being recognised in equity.
In addition, upon dilution of minority interests the difference between the cash received from sale or listing of the subsidiary shares and the increase to minority interest is also recognised in equity.
Investments in Associates In the consolidated financial information, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signi cant in uence over operating and financial policies and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity but is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above and is included in the carrying value of investments in associate.
The investment is initially recorded at the cost to the Group in the consolidated Balance Sheet and then, in subsequent periods, the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to re ect the Groups share of the associates pro ts or losses and for impairment of goodwill and any other changes to the associates net assets.
The consolidated Income Statement includes the Groups share of associates results, except where the associate is generating losses and the Groups investment in the associate has been written down to zero.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
The unamortised balance is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Financial Statements 66 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 a Accounting Policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment Mining Properties and Leases Exploration and evaluation expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment under the heading Mining properties and leases in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production primary development expenditure other than land, buildings, plant and equipment, etc is capitalised as part of the cost of the mining property until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial production criteria mentioned above and are subject to impairment review.
Stripping costs and secondary development expenditure, mainly comprising of costs on blasting, haulage, excavation, etc incurred during the production stage of operations of an ore body is charged to the Income Statement immediately.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Property, Plant and Equipment The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs.
Expenditure incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are normally charged to the Income Statement in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Major shut-down and overhaul expenditure is capitalised.
Assets in the Course of Construction Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the assets under construction account.
At the point when an asset is operating at managements intended use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset and any obligatory decommissioning costs are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
Depreciation Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, freehold land and goodwill are not depreciated.
Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in Property, plant and equipment mining properties and leases.
Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease or if shorter their useful economic life.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, of ce equipment and xtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Buildings: Operations 30 years Administration 50 years Plant and equipment 1020 years Of ce equipment and xtures 320 years Motor vehicles 911 years OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 67 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 2 a Accounting Policies continued Major overhaul costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the economic bene t derived from the overhaul.
The carrying amount of the remaining previous overhaul cost is charged to the Income Statement if the next overhaul is undertaken earlier than the previously estimated life of the economic bene t. Property, plant and equipment held for sale or which is part of a disposal group held for sale is not depreciated.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less disposal cost and is presented separately on the face of the Balance Sheet.
Non-current Assets Held for Sale Non-current assets and disposal Groups are classi ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal Group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classi cation.
Impairment The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and investments in associates are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually.
If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the Income Statement.
The Group reviews the residual value and useful life of an asset at least at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change s is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future cash ows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other property, plant and equipment, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an arms length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cash-generating unit.
Government Grants Government grants relating to tangible xed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the Income Statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the Income Statement as and when the related expenditure is incurred.
Inventories Inventories and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following bases: Purchased copper concentrate is recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: all other materials including stores and spares are valued on weighted average basis.
Finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity: and by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Taxation Tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Financial Statements 68 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 a Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax is provided, using the Balance Sheet method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Exceptions to this principle are: Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is not recognised on goodwill impairment which is not deductible for tax purposes or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting pro t nor taxable pro t or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro t will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant Group entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Retirement Bene t Schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of fide ned bene ts and contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are where funded held in separately administered funds.
The cost of providing bene ts under the plans is determined each year separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method by independent quali ed actuaries.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are recognised in full in the Income Statement of the year.
For fide ned contribution schemes, the amount charged to the Income Statement in respect of pension costs and other postretirement bene ts is the contributions payable in the year.
Share-Based Payments Certain employees including Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to re ect the current expectations.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an out ow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci c to the liability.
Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Income Statement as a finance cost.
Provisions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and are adjusted to re ect the current best estimate.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine.
Costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and a corresponding amount is capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged to the Income Statement over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
The cost estimates are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re ect known developments which may have an impact on the cost estimates or life of operations.
The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, changes to lives of operations, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates.
The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate.
The unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the Income Statement.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and charged to the Income Statement as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 69 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 2 a Accounting Policies continued Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For all principal operating subsidiaries, the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which it operates, except KCM wherein the functional currency is US dollars, since that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated into functional currency at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the Income Statement, except where the monetary item is designated as an effective hedging instrument of the currency risk of designated forecast sales, where exchange differences are recognised in equity.
For the purposes of consolidation, the Income Statement items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The related Balance Sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation would be recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial Asset Investments Financial asset investments are classi ed as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity.
On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled into the Income Statement.
Investments in unquoted equity instruments that do not have a market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.
Equity investments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.
Liquid Investments Liquid investments represent short term current asset investments that do not meet the fide nition of cash and cash equivalents for one or more of the following reasons: they have a maturity pro le greater than 90 days: and or they may be subject to a greater risk of changes in value than cash: and or they are held of investment purposes.
The change in fair value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for impairment for trade receivables is made where there is an event, which based on previous experience, is an indication of a reduction in the recoverability of the carrying value of the trade receivables.
Trade Payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Equity Instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insigni cant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial Statements 70 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 a Accounting Policies continued Convertible Bonds The Vedanta convertible bond is accounted for as a compound instrument.
The equity component and the liability component were separated out on the date of the issue.
The equity component has been recognised in a separate reserve and is not being subsequently remeasured.
The liability component is held at amortised cost.
The interest expensed on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate, being the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between this amount and interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability component.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their intended use ie when they are capable of commercial production.
Where funds are borrowed speci cally to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where surplus funds are available out of money borrowed speci cally to finance a project, the income generated from such short-term investments is also capitalised and reduced from the total capitalised borrowing cost.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative Financial Instruments In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are remeasured at their fair value at subsequent Balance Sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement.
The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the Income Statement and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are recorded in equity.
This includes certain non-derivative liabilities that are designated as instruments used to hedge the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales.
Amounts deferred to equity are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the Balance Sheet date and gains or losses are recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer quali es for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net pro t or loss for the year.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the Income Statement.
2 b Critical Accounting Judgement and Estimation Uncertainty In the course of applying the policies outlined in note 2 a, management made estimations and assumptions that impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Vedanta believes that judgement and estimation has been made in the following areas: Mining Properties and Leases The carrying value of mining property and leases is arrived at by depreciating the assets over the life of the mine using the unit of production method based on proved and probable reserves.
The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating to life of the mine and may change when new information becomes available.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could impact the depreciation rates, asset carrying values and environmental and restoration provisions.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 71 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 2 b Critical Accounting Judgement and Estimation Uncertainty continued Useful Economic Lives of Assets and Impairment Property, plant and equipment other than mining properties and leases are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes could affect the depreciation rates prospectively and hence the asset carrying values.
The Group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including mining properties and leases, for possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
In assessing the property, plant and equipment for impairment, factors leading to signi cant reduction in pro ts such as changes in commodity prices, the Groups business plans and signi cant downward revision in the estimated mining reserves are taken into consideration.
The carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit CGU and associated mining reserves is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Value in use is usually determined on the basis of discounted estimated future cash ows.
This involves management estimates on commodity prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory climates, long-term mine plan, discount rates and other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash ow due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact on the carrying value of the assets.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs: Provision is made for costs associated with restoration and rehabilitation of mining sites as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
Such restoration and closure costs are typical of extractive industries and they are normally incurred at the end of the life of the mine.
The costs are estimated on the basis of mine closure plans and the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities and the costs of restoration are capitalised when incurred, re ecting our obligations at that time.
A corresponding provision is created on the liability side.
The capitalised asset is charged to the Income Statement over the life of the asset through depreciation over the life of the operation and the provision is increased each period via unwinding the discount on the provision.
Management estimates are based on local legislation and or other agreements such as the KCM acquisition agreement.
The actual costs and cash out ows may differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, changes in prices, analysis of site conditions and changes in restoration technology.
As per local legislation, our Indian operations provide for restoration costs in accordance with statutory requirements.
In Australia, appropriate provision has been made in accordance with local legal requirements and at KCM, a provision has been recognised with reference to a plan agreed with the Government of Zambia at the time of KCMs privatisation in April 2000 and pursuant to the KCM acquisition agreement.
Provisions and Liabilities: Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future out ow of funds resulting from past operations or events that can be reasonably estimated.
The timing of recognition requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances which may be subject to change.
The actual cash out ows take place over many years in the future and hence the carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account the changing circumstances and other factors that in uence the provisions and liabilities.
Contingencies and Commitments: In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the company.
Where the potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or are very dif cult to quantify reliably, we treat them as contingent liabilities.
Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the financial statements.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the final outcome of the legal proceedings, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or pro tability.
Underlying Earnings and Special Items: In addition to the financial statements, we present Underlying earnings after adjusting for special items as an additional measure of performance in order to provide a better understanding of the underlying business operational results.
Such special items are generally non-recurring in nature and are disclosed separately in the financial statements.
Identi cation of such items involves a degree of judgement by the management.

Segment Information The Groups primary format for segmental reporting is business segments.
The business segments consist of aluminium, copper, zinc and iron ore, with residual components being reported as Other mainly energy.
Business segment data includes an allocation of certain corporate costs, allocated on an appropriate basis.
The risks and returns of the Groups operations are primarily determined by the nature of the different activities in which the Group is engaged.
Inter-segment sales are charged based on prevailing market prices.
The Groups activities are organised on a global basis.
Tax balances have been included within segment assets and segment liabilities on the basis that they materially relate to speci c segments.

Tax continued Overview of the Indian Direct Tax Regime The following is an overview of the salient features of the Indian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of the Group: Companies are subject to Indian income tax on a stand-alone basis.
There is no concept of tax consolidation or Group relief in India.
Companies are charged tax on pro ts of assessment years starting from 1 April to 31 March next.
For each assessment year, a companys pro ts will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum Alternative Tax MAT.
Where MAT is greater than the tax on regular basis, MAT is levied.
Regular income tax is charged on book pro ts prepared under Indian GAAP adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act.
Typically the required adjustments generate signi cant timing differences in respect of the depreciation on xed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax losses brought forward and pension costs.
Regular income tax is charged at 30% plus a surcharge and cess taking the effective tax rate to 33.99%.
The corporate tax rate for 200809 has been retained at 33.99%.
MAT is charged on the book pro ts at 10% plus a surcharge and cess.
The effective rate of MAT is 11.33%.
However, MAT paid during a year can be set off against normal tax payable in the subsequent years in the manner provided in the statute within a period of seven years succeeding the assessment year in which the MAT credit arose.
Investments in projects where alternative energy is generated are subject to accelerated depreciation whereby 80% of the investment is depreciated in the first year.
There are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India subject to ful lment of prescribed conditions.
The most important ones applicable to the Group are: Industrial undertakings tax holiday: Pro ts of newly constructed industrial undertakings located in designated areas of India can bene t from a tax holiday.
A typical tax holiday would exempt 100% of the plants pro ts for five years and 30% for the next five years.
Power plants tax holiday: Pro ts on newly constructed power plants can bene t from a tax holiday.
A typical holiday would exempt 100% of pro ts in 10 consecutive years within the first 15 years of the power plants operation.
The start of the 10-year period can be chosen by a company.
Pro ts from units designated as an Export Oriented Unit EOU, from where goods are exported out of India, are tax exempt up to March 2010.
Tax is payable in the financial year to which it relates.
Tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and challenge by the tax authorities.
There are appeal procedures prescribed.
Both the tax authorities and taxpayers can prefer appeals to the appellate forums and it is not uncommon for signi cant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for several years before they are nally resolved either in the High Court or in the Supreme Court.
Overview of the Zambian Tax Regime The following is an overview of the salient features of the Zambian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of the Group as amended with effect from 1 April 2008: The tax rate for mining companies is 30% for pro ts generated from 1 April, 2008.
For FY 200809 the capital allowance in the form of depreciation is changed to 25% from 100% prevailing in the earlier years.
Transitional provisions have been suitably incorporated in the year 200809.
New tax has been introduced in the form of either windfall tax or variable pro t tax: Windfall tax becomes payable when copper is sold at prices above US$5,512 per MT.
The tax is charged at rates ranging from 25% to 75% of differential between the realised price and speci c price thresholds ranging upward from US$5,512 per mt.
Windfall tax is not a deductible expense in the computation of income tax.
Variable pro t tax becomes payable where income from mining activities exceeds 8% of gross sales at a rate determined according to a prescribed formula and payable only if windfall tax is not payable.
The period available to carry forward losses has been reduced from 20 years to 10 years.
KCM received a letter from the Zambian Revenue Authority ZRA during the year con rming that the company will only be required to pay windfall tax at a rate of 25% at any price above the first threshold outlined above.
KCM has used the principles outlined in the letter as the basis for its current tax provision for the year, as it believes the terms of the letter are likely to be honoured.
If this is not the case, the additional tax due under the original terms of the windfall tax regime will be approximately US$13 million.
On 30 January 2009 the Minister of Finance of the Zambian Government published the 2009 budget.
As expected there were positive changes to the mining tax regime announced including: Abolition of the windfall tax: Increase in the capital allowance back to 100%: and Set-off of hedging losses against mining pro t was prohibited in FY 200809.
This prohibition has been removed in 200910 and onward.
The 2009 changes will take effect on 1 April 2009.

Also during the year ended 31 March 2009, 42,452 shares were issued on conversion of a portion of the convertible bond 2008: 50,169 shares.
The issue of these shares has been included in determining the 2009 weighted average number of shares.

Earnings per Share continued Pro t for the year would be increased if holders of the convertible bonds in Vedanta exercised their right to convert their bond holdings into Vedanta equity.
The impact on pro t for the year of this conversion would be the reduction in interest payable on the convertible bond.
The outstanding awards under the LTIP are re ected in the diluted EPS gure through an increased number of weighted average shares.
The conversion feature of the Convertible Bonds was antidilutive in the current year and has therefore been omitted from the calculation of the diluted EPS.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares since the reporting date and before the completion of these financial statements.

Convertible Bonds continued The net proceeds of the convertible issue have been split between the liability element and equity component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company.

During the year ended 31 March 2009, US$1.1m of convertible bonds were converted into 42,452 equity shares, reducing the liability component of the convertible bonds by US$0.9 million, generating share capital and share premium of US$1.1 million and releasing US$0.2 million from convertible bond reserve.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, US$4.0 million was transferred from the convertible bond reserve to retained earnings, representing the realisation of distributable reserves following accretion of the convertible bond liability.
This amount constitutes the accretion during the year, being the interest and amortisation of issue cost, less coupon interest as outlined in the table above.
The fair value of the convertible bonds as on 31 March 2009 is US$714.9 million 2008: US$667.2 million Although the bondholders have the option to convert at any time, it is considered appropriate to classify the convertible bonds as due in more than one year.
This is based on the relative rate of return to bondholders from the bonds as compared to historic and expected dividend yields, the length of time prior to redemption, the limited number of conversions to date and the fact that conversion does not result in the transfer of cash or other financial assets.

Financial Instruments continued Derivatives Instruments and Risk Management The Groups businesses are subject to several risks and uncertainties including financial risks.
The Groups documented risk management policies act as an effective tool in mitigating the various financial risks to which the businesses are exposed to in the course of their daily operations.
The risk management policies cover areas such as liquidity risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital management.
Risks are identi ed through a formal risk management programme with active involvement of senior management personnel and business managers at both the corporate and individual subsidiary level.
Each operating subsidiary in the Group has in place risk management processes which are in line with the Groups policy.
Each signi cant risk has a designated owner within the Group at an appropriate senior level.
The potential financial impact of the risk and its likelihood of a negative outcome are regularly updated.
The risk management process is coordinated by the Management Assurance function and is regularly reviewed by the Groups Audit Committee.
Key business decisions are discussed at the monthly meetings of the Executive Committee.
The overall internal control environment and risk management programme including financial risk management is reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
Treasury Management Treasury management focuses on capital protection, liquidity maintenance and yield maximisation.
The treasury policies are approved by the Board and adherence to these policies is strictly monitored at the Executive Committee meetings.
Day-to-day treasury operations of the subsidiary companies are managed by their respective finance teams within the framework of the overall Group treasury policies.
Long-term fund raising including strategic treasury initiatives are handled by a central team while short-term funding for routine working capital requirements is delegated to subsidiary companies.
A monthly reporting system exists to inform senior management of investments, debt, currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives.
The Group has a strong system of internal control which enables effective monitoring of adherence to Group policies.
The internal control measures are effectively supplemented by regular internal audits.
The Group uses derivative instruments as part of its management of exposure to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Group does not enter into complex derivative transactions to manage the treasury and commodity risks.
Both treasury and commodities derivative transactions are normally in the form of forward contracts and interest rate and currency swaps and these are subject to the Group guidelines and policies.
Interest rate swaps are taken to achieve a balance between xed and oating rates as described below under Interest risk and currency swaps are taken primarily to convert the Groups exposure to non-US dollar currencies to US dollar currencies.
Commodity Risk The Group is exposed to the movement of base metal commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange.
Any decline in the prices of the base metals that the Group produces and sells will have an immediate and direct impact on the pro tability of the businesses.
As a general policy, the Group aims to sell the products at prevailing market prices.
As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable contractual terms.
The Group undertakes hedging activity in commodities to a limited degree.
Hedging is used primarily as a risk management tool and, in some cases, to secure future cash ows in cases of high volatility by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments.
The hedging activities are subject to strict limits set out by the Board and to a strictly fide ned internal control and monitoring mechanism.
Decisions relating to hedging of commodities are taken at the Executive Committee level and with clearly laid down guidelines for their implementation by the subsidiaries.
Whilst the Group aims to achieve average LME prices for a month or a year, average realised prices may not necessarily re ect the LME price movements because of a variety of reasons such as uneven sales during the year and timing of shipments.
Copper The Groups custom smelting copper operations at Tuticorin is bene ted by a natural hedge except to the extent of a possible mismatch in quotational periods between the purchase of concentrate and the sale of nished copper.
The Groups policy on custom smelting is to generate margins from TCRCs, minimising conversion cost, premium over LME on sale of nished copper, sale of by-products and from achieving import parity on domestic sales.
Hence, mismatches in quotational periods are actively managed to ensure that the gains or losses are minimised.
The Group hedges this variability of LME prices and tries to make the LME price a pass-through cost between purchases of copper concentrate and sales of nished products, both of which are linked to the LME price.
The Company also bene ts from the difference between the amounts paid for quantities of copper contents received and recovered in the manufacturing process, also known as free copper.
The Group hedges on a selective basis the free copper and revenue from variable margins on the purchases of copper concentrates by entering into future contracts.
Financial Statements 88 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27.
Financial Instruments continued The Groups Australian mines in Tasmania supply approximately 8% to 9% of the requirement of the custom copper smelter at Tuticorin.
Hence, TCRCs are a major source of income for the Indian copper smelting operations.
Fluctuations in TCRCs are in uenced by factors including demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market for mine output.
The Groups copper business has a strategy of securing a majority of its concentrate feed requirement under long-term contracts with mines.
KCM is largely an integrated copper producer and hence the strategy to protect the company from price uctuations in copper is to focus on controlling KCMs costs.
For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, part of the production may be hedged to secure cash ows on a selective basis.
Aluminium The requirement of the primary raw material, alumina, is partly met from own sources and the rest is purchased primarily on negotiated price terms.
Sales prices are linked to the LME prices.
At present the Group does not hedge any aluminium production.
Zinc and Lead Raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the LME prices.
The Group has some long term volume contracts with some customers where the prices are linked to prevailing LME prices at the time of shipment.
The Group hedged part of the exports from India through forward contracts or other instruments.
Iron Ore The Group sells some portion of its iron ore production on annual price contracts and the balance on the basis of prevailing market prices.
Provisionally Priced Financial Instruments On 31 March 2009, the value of net financial assets linked to commodities excluding derivatives accounted for on provisional prices was a liability of US$147.7 million 2008: asset of US$9.0 million.
These instruments are subject to price movements at the time of final settlement and the final price of these instruments will be determined in financial year beginning 1 April 2009.

Financial Instruments continued Financial Risk and Sensitivities The Groups Board approved financial risk policies comprise liquidity, currency, interest rate and counterparty risk.
In principle, the Group does not engage in speculative treasury activity but seeks to manage risk and optimise interest and commodity pricing through proven financial instruments.
a Liquidity The Group requires funds both for short-term operational needs as well as for long-term investment programmes mainly in growth projects.
The Group generates suf cient cash ows from the current operations which together with the available cash and cash equivalents and liquid financial asset investments provide liquidity both in the short term as well as in the long term.
Anticipated future cash ows and undrawn committed facilities of US$1,909.4 million, together with cash and liquid investments of US$4,912.5 million as at 31 March 2009, are expected to be suf cient to meet the ongoing capital investment programme and liquidity requirement of the Group in the near future.
The Group has a strong Balance Sheet that gives suf cient headroom to raise further debt should the need arise.
The Groups current ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys are BB and Ba1 respectively 2008: BB and Baa3 respectively.
These ratings support the necessary financial leverage and access to debt or equity markets at competitive terms.
The Group generally maintains a healthy net debt-equity ratio and retains exibility in the nancing structure to alter the ratio when the need arises.

Financial Instruments continued b Foreign Currency The Groups presentation currency is the US dollar.
The majority of the assets are located in India and the Indian Rupee is the functional currency for the Indian operating subsidiaries.
Foreign currency exposures are managed through the Group-wide hedging policy, which is reviewed periodically to ensure that the risk from uctuating currency exchange rates is appropriately managed.
Natural hedges available in the business are identi ed at each entity level and hedges are placed only for the net exposure.
Short-term net exposures are hedged progressively based on their maturity.
A more conservative approach has been adopted for project expenditures to avoid budget overruns.
Longer term exposures are unhedged.

OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 91 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 27.
Financial Instruments continued c Interest Risk At 31 March 2009, the Groups net debt of US$200.8 million 2008: US$2,142.7 million net cash comprises of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments of US$4,912.6 million 2008: US$5,106.7 million offset by debt of US$5,113.4 million 2008: US$2,964.0 million.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term oating rate instruments and on the re nancing of xed rate debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain a balance of xed and oating interest rate borrowings and the proportion of xed and oating rate debt is determined by current market interest rates.
As at 31 March 2009, 49% 2008: 29% of the total debt was at a xed rate and the balance was at a oating rate.
The oating rate debt is largely linked to US dollar LIBOR.
The Group also aims to minimise its average interest rates on borrowings by opting for a higher proportion of long-term debt to fund growth projects.
The Group invests cash and liquid investments in short-term deposits and debt mutual funds, some of which generate a tax-free return, to achieve the Groups goal of maintaining liquidity, carrying manageable risk and achieving satisfactory returns.
Floating rate financial assets are largely mutual fund investments which have debt securities as underlying asset.
The returns from these financial assets are linked to market interest rate movements: however the counterparty invests in the agreed securities with known maturity tenure and return and hence has manageable risk.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 March 2009 At 31 March 2008 | Non-interest Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial Equity financial financial financial Equity financial US$ million assets assets Investments assets assets assets Investments assets Financial assets 4,282.2 583.2 91.6 803.5 4,677.9 635.7 30.0 871.0 Derivative assets 134.8 139.8 Total financial assets 4,282.2 583.2 91.6 938.3 4,677.9 635.7 30.0 1,010.8 The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 March 2009 At 31 March 2008 | Non-interest Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial financial financial financial US$ million liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Financial liabilities 2,715.2 3,160.2 1,283.6 2,723.4 924.9 1,344.4 Derivative liabilities 174.4 107.0 Total financial liabilities 2,715.2 3,160.2 1,458.0 2,723.4 924.9 1,451.4 The weighted average interest rate on the xed rate financial liabilities is 8.5% 2008: 6.5% and the weighted average period for which the rate is xed is 5.4 years 2008: 3.9 years.
Considering the net debt position as at 31 March 2009 and the investment in bank deposits and debt mutual funds, any increase in interest rates would result in a net loss and any decrease in interest rates would result in a net gain.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date.
Financial Statements 92 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27.

The Group has clearly fide ned policies to mitigate counterparty risks.
Cash and liquid investments are held primarily in mutual funds and banks with good credit ratings.
fide ned limits are in place for exposure to individual counterparties in case of mutual fund houses and banks.
The large majority of receivables due from third parties are secured.
Moreover, given the diverse nature of our businesses trade receivables are spread over a number of customers with no signi cant concentration of credit risk.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Groups net sales or for any of the Groups primary businesses during the year ended 31 March 2009 and in the previous year.
The history of trade receivables shows a negligible provision for bad and doubtful debts.
Therefore, the Group does not expect any material risk on account of non-performance by any of our counterparties.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2009 is US$5,895.3 million 2008: US$6,354.4 million.
Of the year end trade and other receivable balance the following were past due but not impaired as at 31 March 2009.

Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classi ed as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.
Embedded Derivatives Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other contracts are treated as separate derivative contracts, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts.

Financial Instruments continued Cash Flow Hedges The Group also enters into forward exchange and commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transactions and accounts for them as cash ow hedges and states them at fair value.
Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the Income Statement.
The fair value of the Groups open derivative positions at 31 March 2009 excluding own use purchase and sale contracts, recorded within other financial assets derivatives and other financial liabilities derivatives is as follows: At 31 March 2009 At 31 March 2008 | US$ million Liability Asset Liability Asset Current Cash ow hedges Commodity contracts 0.5 Forward foreign currency contracts 14.2 35.6 14.7 3.4 Interest rate swap oating to xed 1.3 Fair value hedges Commodity contracts 0.2 0.8 Forward foreign currency contracts 6.7 7.2 5.3 Interest rate swap 13.6 Others foreign currency swap 30.8 24.3 Non-qualifying hedges Commodity contracts 41.8 0.5 35.7 Forward foreign currency contracts 27.7 0.1 0.5 Interest rate swap Total 114.7 82.0 23.3 44.9 Non-current Fair value hedges Forward foreign currency contracts Interest rate swap 15.3 Others foreign currency swap 59.7 52.8 83.7 79.7 Total 59.7 52.8 83.7 95.0 Grand total 174.4 134.8 107.0 139.9 The majority of cash ow hedges taken out by the Group during the year comprise forward foreign currency contracts for rm future commitments.
Non-Qualifying Hedges The majority of these derivatives comprise copper sale and purchase contracts at Sterlite custom smelting operations which are economic hedges but which do not ful l the requirements for hedge accounting of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Fair Value Hedges The fair value hedges relate to interest rate swaps xed to oating taken out by the Group to hedge the fair value risk on the US$600 million bonds due in 2010.
The Group has also entered into US dollar and Japanese yen cross-currency swaps with a maturity of 2010.
Equal and opposite swaps are held in two Group companies, such that no signi cant net exposure to the Group arises.

These amounts become payable on closure of mines and are expected to be incurred over a period of 3 to 20 years.
Other Other provisions comprise the Directors best estimate of the costs which may be incurred in the future to settle certain legal and tax claims outstanding against the Group, which exist primarily in India.
Other provisions also include a provision in respect of a price participation agreement which requires KCM to pay ZCCM an agreed annual sum when copper prices exceed speci ed levels and other triggers, amounting to US$94.4 million 2008: US$95.9 million.
The timing of the out ow of this provision is dependent on future copper prices and hence cannot be reasonably ascertained.

Share-Based Payments Employee Share Schemes The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of at risk remuneration for Executive Directors.
Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing.
The Board has no present intention to introduce any further share schemes.
The Vedanta Resources Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP The LTIP is the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives are provided to the Executive Directors and the wider management Group.
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100% of annual salary.
In respect of Messrs Navin Agarwal and MS Mehta, salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by Vedanta and their gross salary payable by Sterlite.
The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the wider management Group is calculated by reference to the base salary, share-based remuneration already received and consistent with local market practice.
The performance condition attaching to outstanding awards under the LTIP is that the Companys performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return TSR being the movement in a companys share price plus reinvested dividends, is compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as fide ned in the scheme from the date of grant.
The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Companys TSR rank against a Group of peer companies Adapted Comparator Group at the end of the performance period.
The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.
Financial Statements 96 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 30.
Share-Based Payments continued Vedantas TSR Performance against Adapted Comparator Group % of award vesting Below median At median 40 At or above upper quartile 100 The performance condition will be measured by taking the Companys TSR over the four weeks immediately preceding the date of grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the comparator Group described above.
The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee the Committee will be provided by the Companys advisers.
The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Companys total return has out-performed a group of companies chosen to represent the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the Executive Directors and the wider management Group with those of the shareholders.
No awards will vest unless the Committee is satis ed that the Companys TSR performance reasonably re ects the Companys underlying financial performance.
Initial awards under the LTIP were granted on 26 February 2004 with further awards being made on 11 June 2004, 23 November 2004, 1 February 2006, 1 February 2007, 14 November 2007 and 1 February 2009.
The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance period is one year for the February 2007 awards and three years for all other awards, with no re-testing being allowed.
The exercise period is six months from the date of vesting.
Further details on the LTIP are found in the Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51.

The weighted average share price for the share options exercised during the year was 5.99.
All share-based awards of the Group are equity-settled as fide ned by IFRS 2 Share Based Payment.
The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using a Monte Carlo model with suitable modi cations to allow for the speci c performance conditions of the LTIP.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends and the risk free rate of interest.
A progressive dividend growth policy is assumed in all fair value calculations.
Expected volatility has been calculated using historical share prices over the period to date of grant that is commensurate with the performance period of the option.
The share prices of the mining companies in the Adapted Comparator Group have been modelled based on historical price movements over the period to date of grant which is also commensurate with the performance period for the option.
The history of share prices is used to determine the volatility and correlation of share prices for the companies in the Adapted Comparator Group and is needed for the Monte Carlo simulation of their future TSR performance relative to the Companys TSR performance.
All options are assumed to be exercised six weeks after vesting.

Retirement Bene ts The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia and Zambia.
a fide ned Contribution Schemes Indian Pension Schemes Central Provident Fund The Central Provident Fund relates to all full time Indian employees of the Group.
The amount contributed by the Group is a designated percentage of 12% of basic salary less contributions made as part of the Pension Fund see below, together with an additional contribution of 12% of salary made by the employee.
The bene t is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to senior executives.
Certain companies hold policies with the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC, to which they contribute a xed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into consideration the contributions made.
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a fide ned contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the Income Statement.
The LIC manages certain companies pension scheme assets and provides a certi cate to those companies, outlining the annual rate of return on the scheme assets.
The rates of return in respect of the year ended 31 March 2009 ranged from 7.5% to 9.5% 2008: from 7.5% to 9.3%.
Pension Fund The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the government.
The employee makes no contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month subject to a speci ed ceiling per employee.
This must be provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of superannuation, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level.
The government funds these payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in surplus or fide cit.
Australian Pension Scheme The Group also operates fide ned contribution pension schemes in Australia.
The contribution of a proportion of an employees salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia.
The employer contributes 9% of the employees gross remuneration where the employee is covered by the industrial agreement and 12% of the basic remuneration for all other employees, into the employees fund of choice.
All employees have the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian Pension Scheme The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full time permanent employees of KCM subject to the ful lment of certain eligibility criteria.
The management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the members.
The employer makes a monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme of an amount equal to 11% of that months pensionable salary and the member makes monthly contributions to the fund of an amount equal to 5% of that months pensionable salary.
Financial Statements 98 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 31.
Retirement Bene ts continued All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal retirement age of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the service of the employer.
Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of performing duties, or early voluntary retirement within five years of retirement, the member is entitled to receive an immediate annual pension equal to his accrued pension.
The member is allowed to commute his her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.
The trustees of the KCM Pension Scheme may also allow the purchase of an annuity for the bene t of members from a life assurance company or other providers of annuities, subject to statutory regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the KCM Pension Scheme is in surplus or fide cit.
b fide ned Bene t Schemes India The Gratuity schemes are fide ned bene t schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of service with their employing company.

Under these schemes, bene ts are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out on an annual basis.
MALCO MALCO does not contribute to the LIC.
Its Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a fide ned bene t basis.
An actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2008 using the projected unit actuarial method.
At that date the fund was in fide cit.
BALCO At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2009 are covered by the LIC and remaining contributions to the LIC have been made and have been accounted for on a fide ned contribution basis.
The Gratuity scheme is accounted for as a fide ned bene t scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2009 and who are not covered by the LIC.

Business Combinations Agreement to Acquire Asarco On 30 May 2008, Sterlite entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement PSA with Asarco LLC, USA Asarco, under which it agreed to purchase Asarcos operating assets for a consideration of US$2.6 billion.
Due to unprecedented financial turmoil and adverse global market conditions, on 13 October 2008, Sterlite informed Asarco of its intention to renegotiate the purchase consideration.
Subsequently Asarco issued a notice of termination of the original PSA and informed Sterlite of its intention to draw upon a US$50 million letter of credit given by Sterlite as a deposit at the time of signing the PSA.

Contingencies The Group has the following signi cant contingencies.
With regard to the claims against Group companies included below, unless stated, no provision has been made in the financial statements as the Directors believe that it is more likely than not that the claims will not give rise to a material liability.
MALCO Claims with Tamil Nadu Electricity Board TNEB Under the terms of a financial aid package, MALCO was entitled to bene t from reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1995 to 1999.
In 1997, MALCO became pro table and in 1999 the TNEB made a claim against MALCO for the difference in value between full price and reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1997 to 1999.
The value of this claim was US$62.3 million.
The case was heard before the Madras High Court in November 1999 and it found in MALCOs favour.
TNEB has appealed the decision with a large bench.
While admitting the appeal led by TNEB, the larger bench refused to grant stay except for refund of US$2 million, lying paid by the company earlier under protest.
TNEB is also claiming US$20.1 million from MALCO for an electricity self-generation levy for the period from May 1999 to June 2003.
This claim has arisen since the commissioning of MALCOs captive power plant in 1999.
The company has sought an exemption from the application of this levy from the Government of India.
The application is under consideration.
Meanwhile, the Madras High Court has granted an interim ruling in favour of MALCO pending a final decision.
BALCO: Claim of Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board CSEB During the year ended 31 March 2008, CSEB claimed that they had over paid for power supplied by BALCO.
BALCO is contesting the claim on the basis that it is con icting with the power purchase agreement between the two entities.
The overall exposure to the Group in respect of this matter is US$15.7 million.
Both the parties have submitted claims before the arbitrator and the arbitrator passed order in favour of the company.
The company pursued CSEB for the payment under the terms of the order and led an application to the Chattisgarh State Electricity Regulatory Commission CSERC for the recovery.
HZL: Department of Mines and Geology The Department of Mines and Geology of the State of Rajasthan issued several show cause notices in August, September and October 2006 to HZL, totalling US$65.5 million.
These notices alleged unlawful occupation and unauthorised mining of associated minerals other than zinc and lead at HZLs Rampura Agucha, Rajpura Dariba and Zawar mines in Rajasthan during the period from July 1968 to March 2006.
HZL believes that the likelihood of this claim becoming an obligation of the company is unlikely and thus no provision has been made in the financial statements.
HZL has led writ petitions in the High Court of Rajasthan in Jodhpur and has obtained a stay in respect of these demands.

Company Accounting Policies The Vedanta Resources plc the Company Balance Sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles and UK company law UK GAAP.
The financial information has been prepared on an historical cost basis.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act, the pro t and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
Signi cant Accounting Policies Investments in Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries valued at cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Investment in Preference Shares of Subsidiaries Investments in preference shares of subsidiaries are stated at fair value.
The fair value is represented by the face value of the preference shares as the investments are redeemable at any time for their face value at the option of the Company.
Currency Translation Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, being US dollars, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
Exchange differences arising are recorded within the Income Statement.
Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Deferred Taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the Balance Sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-Based Payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Amounts recharged to subsidiaries in respect of awards granted to employees of subsidiaries are recognised as intercompany debtors until repaid.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans are recorded at the net proceeds received ie net of direct transaction costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on accruals basis and charged to the pro t and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial Instruments The Company has elected to take the exemption provided in paragraph 3C b of FRS 25 in respect of these parent company financial statements.
Full disclosures are provided in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2009.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are remeasured at their fair value at subsequent Balance Sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the pro t and loss account.
The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the pro t and loss account and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the Balance Sheet date and gains or losses are recognised in the pro t and loss account immediately.
