BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS continued Dialogue with Shareholders All holders of Shares in the Company have the right to receive notice of, and attend, all general meetings of the Company, during which the directors are available to discuss issues affecting the Company, and the directors also meet periodically with major shareholders.
The directors are always available to enter into dialogue with shareholders and make themselves available for such purpose whenever required.
The Company believes such communications to be important.
The Investment Manager of AllBlue and the Companys Corporate Broker meet regularly with the Companys major shareholders and reports are provided at least quarterly to the Board of directors on those shareholders views about the Company and any issues or concerns they might have.
Auditor Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as Auditor.
A resolution proposing its reappointment will be submitted at the Companys forthcoming general meeting.
Going Concern Whilst it is not currently anticipated that continuation votes will need to be put to any class of shareholders of the Company in the foreseeable future, the Board cannot be certain that the requirement for one or more continuation votes will not be triggered and, if continuation votes were triggered, it cannot be confirmed that any or all of such continuation votes would be passed.
Notwithstanding such uncertainty, the financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis in light of the Boards assessment of: shareholders appetite to continue their investments in the Company: the anticipated low level of redemptions which might result if a tender offer was made to all shareholders: the continuing viability of the Company on both a reduced net asset and cost base: and the expectation of the directors that the Company will continue for the foreseeable future.
