Factors that may affect future tax charges A number of matters have been agreed during the year with the relevant tax authorities.
At the year end there are no material outstanding factors that would affect future tax charges.
Dividends Under IAS 10, final dividends are excluded from the balance sheet either until they are approved by the company in general meeting or until they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the group.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below: 2009 2008 m m Ordinary dividends on equity shares: Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2007 - 4.12p per share - 5.2 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2008 - 2.27p per share - 2.9 Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2008 - 3.91p per share 5.3 - 5.3 8.1 A final dividend relating to 2009 of 3.91p per share has been proposed by the board.
If approved, this will result in a further distribution of 5.3m and it will be paid on 12 February 2010 to shareholders on the register on 20 November 2009.
No interim dividend for 2009 was declared.
In addition to the above, 0.1m of the provision for dividend payment to the minority interest in FRM made in the accounts to 30 September 2008, has been reversed.
Further shares were acquired by the group prior to the payment date resulting in a payment of only 0.1m.
The total dividend taken to equity in the year is therefore 5.2m 2008: 8.3m.
Loss per share Basic Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the group and held both in trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the long-term incentive scheme 'LTIS'.
Diluted Diluted loss earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its convertible bond and its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIS, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2009 was the end of the contingency period.
The loss profit for the year is adjusted to add back the after tax interest cost on the debt component of the convertible bond.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, as is the case for both years being reported, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss earnings per share.
