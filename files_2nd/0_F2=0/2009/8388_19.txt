60 | Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The determination of whether a liability should be disclosed as a contingent liability or recognised as a provision requires judgements to be made on the existence of a present obligation and the probability of future events.
When a provision is required, the amount recognised is determined using judgements and assumptions, based on current knowledge, to estimate the amount and timing of future cash outflows arising from the liabilities.
At 31 March 2009, the estimated amount of liabilities requiring provisions was 211 million 2008: 162 million.
Further details are given in Note 24.
Details of the Groups contingent liabilities are set out in Note 30.
Construction and long-term service provision contracts The Groups Process Systems and Invensys Rail businesses undertake projects that frequently span more than one accounting period and are accounted for as construction or long-term service provision contracts.
The Groups accounting policies for these projects require revenues and costs to be allocated to individual accounting periods and the consequent recognition at period end of contract assets or liabilities for projects still in progress.
The application of these policies requires management to apply judgement in estimating the total revenue and total costs expected on each project.
Such estimates are revised as a project progresses to reflect the current status of the project and the latest information available to management.
Project management teams perform regular reviews to ensure the latest estimates are appropriate.
The amount of revenue relating to projects accounted for as construction or long-term service provision contracts recognised in the year ended 31 March 2009 was 1,110 million 2008: 1,070 million.
The net amount due to contract customers on projects in progress at 31 March 2009 was 25 million 2008: 92 million due to contract customers.
Further details of amounts due from and to contract customers are included in Note 18.

iv Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order In December 2006, Invensys filed a claim in the High Court for compensation arising from the payment of advance corporation tax and from satisfying liabilities to corporation tax arising from the receipt of dividends from non UK resident subsidiaries.
Invensys contends that these tax liabilities were incurred in breach of its EU community law rights.
Invensys joined a Group Litigation Order with over 20 other corporates from whom two test cases were selected to proceed to trial on a representative basis.
In December 2006, the European Court of Justice issued its guidance to the UK High Court on the compatability of certain UK tax provisions within EU community law.
The test cases returned to the UK High Court for the full hearing in July 2008, with the UK High Court issuing its judgement on 27 November 2008.
The UK High Court judgement in November 2008 found in favour of the claimants on certain key aspects of the claim.
The judgement concluded, inter alia, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, effectively exempt from UK taxation.
It also concluded that certain dividends received from EU subsidiaries before 5 April 1999 and, in some limited circumstances, after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income with the consequence that advance corporation tax need not have been paid.
The case will now proceed to the Court of Appeal.
Depending on the outcome of the appeal, a further reference to the European Court of Justice may be necessary before the issue is ultimately resolved.
Given the importance of the matters it is expected that appeals will ultimately be taken to the House of Lords and therefore this process may take several years to complete.
Given the complexity and uncertainty over the issues raised it is not possible to predict the amounts and final outcome with any reasonable certainty.
As a result no contingent asset has been recognised in these Financial Statements.
10 Discontinued operations No operations have been discontinued in the year to 31 March 2009.
Discontinued operations in the prior year comprised the APV, Safety, Reversing Valves and Burco businesses which were all sold in the year ended 31 March 2008.

An additional earnings per share calculation for continuing operations has been included since the directors consider that this gives useful additional indications of underlying performance.
This is based on earnings before exceptional finance costs and income, foreign exchange losses on financial items and PPP settlement credit.
The diluted earnings loss per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share without reference to adjustments in respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive.
There have been no significant transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these Financial Statements.

Leased assets are pledged as security for the related finance lease.
The title to plant and machinery with a carrying amount of 1 million 2008: 1 million has been pledged as security for liabilities.
Included in plant and equipment at 31 March 2009 was an amount of 6 million 2008: 9 million relating to expenditure for plant and equipment in the course of construction.
Impairment losses of 16 million comprise 11 million in Process Systems and 2 million within Corporate due to property and freehold land impairments as a result of current market conditions and 3 million for the write-down of assets in relation to the closure of manufacturing plants within Invensys Controls business.
2008: 4 million comprising 3 million for the write-down of assets in relation to the closure of manufacturing plants within the Invensys Controls business and 1 million of property impairments within the Eurotherm business.
The recoverable amounts of these assets were estimated based on their fair value less costs to sell.
Fair values were determined based on an assessment of the current market values of the assets and past experience of sales of similar assets.

An analysis of the carrying amount of goodwill by primary business segment is set out below.
Certain business segments comprise a number of CGUs.

Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 13 Intangible assets goodwill continued Annual impairment test The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections over a five year period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: revenue volumes: revenue prices: operating costs: growth rate assumptions for years four and five of the cash flow projections: growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value: and discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are those included in the most recent financial annual operating plans approved by management.
They reflect managements current expectations for each CGU taking account of expected future developments in markets and operations.
Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
These growth rates take into consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels of growth achieved historically by the CGU and forecast in the periods covered by the annual operating plan.
Lower growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal value for each CGU.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
A discount rate is derived for each CGU by adjusting the Groups weighted average cost of capital to reflect the relative level of risk associated with the CGUs cash flow projections.
The discount rate is a pre-tax rate.
These discount rates and growth rates by CGU are as follows: Discount Growth Discount Growth 1 1 rate rate rate rate 2009 2009 2008 2008 % % % % Process Systems IPS 13.19 2.9 11.73 3.6 Wonderware 11.18 2.9 11.73 3.2 Eurotherm 12.32 2.9 12.09 2.9 Invensys Rail 10.39 3.0 Invensys Controls Appliance and Climate Controls 11.72 1.5 10.97 1.5 IMServ 10.60 1.9 10.97 1.5 1 In perpetuity.
In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year 2008: nil.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With respect to the assessment of value in use of all CGUs except Eurotherm, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
With respect to Eurotherm the details are tabulated below: Amount by which the CGUs recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount m 4m Key assumption Terminal growth rate Discount rate Value of key assumption 2.90% 12.32% 1 Amount by which the value assigned to the key assumption must change % points 0.33 % 0.22% 1 In order for the CGUs recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount.

2 Impairment losses of 1 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 relate to the write-down of a specific development asset in Invensys Rail.
The future revenues expected to be derived from the asset have been significantly delayed during the year and are no longer sufficiently certain to support continued recognition of the asset.
The carrying amount of the asset has been written down to nil.
2008: 1 million related to specific development assets in Invensys Rail.
The technology represented by those assets was no longer expected to be used as intended following the PPP settlement and its recoverable amount was reassessed accordingly.
Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | 75 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 15 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon: Pension and other Property, Investments retirement Intangible plant and in Tax benefit assets equipment Inventories subsidiaries losses obligations Other Total m m m m m m m m Deferred income tax assets At 1 April 2007 1 13 7 37 1 2 17 Credit charge to income statement 3 4 6 1 1 3 Transfers 1 1 1 1 At 31 March 2008 1 9 2 30 3 21 Credit charge to income statement 2 5 2 12 7 Acquisition of subsidiary 3 3 Exchange differences 1 4 1 11 7 At 31 March 2009 1 18 5 53 3 32 Deferred income tax liabilities At 1 April 2007 7 6 5 5 3 16 Credit charge to income statement 1 3 4 2 Transfers 1 1 1 1 At 31 March 2008 6 7 5 3 15 Charge credit to income statement 1 1 2 2 Exchange differences 2 1 1 2 At 31 March 2009 9 7 3 4 15 Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
The Group has unrecognised income tax losses of 1,191 million with a tax value of 372 million 2008: 1,081 million with a tax value of 339 million available for offset against future profits.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 54 million 2008: 40 million that will expire within four years.
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 533 million with a tax value of 167 million 2008: 494 million with a tax value of 158 million, as restated for the adoption of IFRIC 14 in respect of pension and other retirement benefit obligations and other deductible temporary differences.
The above tax values include the impact of changes in tax rates in various territories.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of 782 million 2008: 1,966 million that are only available for offset against future capital gains.
Included in capital losses are losses of 206 million 2008: 1,401 million that will expire within four years.
Other capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred income tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 533 million 2008: 998 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Going forward, no significant tax charge would be expected to arise from the reversal of these temporary differences given that a dividend exemption is expected to be introduced in the UK with effect from 1 July 2009 such that dividends received in the UK from overseas subsidiaries will be exempt from UK taxation, assuming the draft legislation is enacted without changes.

These investments were not acquired with the intention of selling them in the near term.
Financial assets with a carrying amount of 25 million classified as held for sale in the September 2008 half-yearly Financial Statements were sold for 27 million during the second half of the year ended 31 March 2009.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The investments classified as at fair value through profit or loss represent investments in unlisted securities that offer the Group the opportunity for return through fair value gains.
The amounts reported at 31 March 2008 related to Nikkei-linked securities with final maturity dates between 2010 and 2020.
These securities were sold during the year ended 31 March 2009 for 5 million.
Market values were determined by external security dealers using pricing models, based on various financial factors including bond prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and the Nikkei Index prices.
The total amount of the change in fair value estimated using a valuation technique that was recognised in the income statement during the year was 2 million 2008: 1 million.
These assets were classified as held for trading.
Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment is due to mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Held-to-maturity investments comprise 9 million of US Treasury Notes held to defease the covenants in the Groups remaining 144A Bonds and 14 million of deposits held to secure certain bonding facilities 2008: nil.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 56 days.
The allowance that has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods is 14 million 2008: 9 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The impairment loss recognised in the year as a result of irrecoverable receivables balances is 7 million 2008: 1 million gain.
Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing.
Other receivables include amounts owed by associated undertakings, interest receivable, refundable deposits, refunds due in respect of VAT, sales and payroll taxes, commissions earned and insurance recoveries.
Movements in the provision for impairment of receivables were as follows: 2009 2008 m m At 1 April 9 13 Disposal of subsidiaries 2 Increase in provisions 8 2 Decrease in provisions 1 3 Utilisation of provisions 5 1 Exchange adjustments 3 At 31 March 14 9 As at 31 March, the analysis of trade receivables that were past due but not impaired is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Neither past due nor impaired 340 337 Past due but not impaired past due by: 1 to 30 days 45 44 31 to 60 days 18 15 61 to 90 days 11 9 91 to 120 days 7 6 121 days and over 5 10 426 421 Generally the Group does not hold any collateral as security against trade receivables that are impaired or past due but not impaired.
The Group performs credit verification procedures on all customers.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Further information on the Groups approach to credit risk in relation to trade and other receivables is given in Note 22.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of current and non-current trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different from their book value.
For information on the exposure of the Groups cash and cash equivalents balances to credit risk refer to Note 22.
Restricted cash and short-term deposits As an international Group, Invensys has operations in a number of territories such as China, Brazil and India which place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories.
However, distributions to the Group are permitted from audited reserves.
At 31 March 2009 restricted cash and cash equivalents held in such territories totalled 73 million 2008: 58 million.
Where banks that are not part of the Groups lending syndicate provide substantial local bonding facilities, current market conditions dictate that they may require collateral which can be provided in the form of a letter of credit issued under the Groups syndicated facility or a cash deposit.
Given the Groups net cash position, a deposit can be the most cost-effective way of providing such collateral.
Cash and cash equivalents include 22 million 2008: 31 million of cash collateral held in the ordinary course of business to provide security for local bonding facilities.

At 31 March 2009 1 million of such loans were classified as non-current liabilities.
As at 31 March 2009, the committed syndicated loan facilities available to the Group comprised a 400 million multicurrency credit facility with a term of five years from July 2008.
The facility is available for drawdown as loans, letters of credit or guarantees.
This facility replaced the banking facilities put in place during the 2006 Refinancing.

2 The borrowers had the right to prepay these facilities at par on five days notice.
The lenders had the right to seek early repayment following any Event of Default or Change of Control.
These facilities carried maintenance covenants that included a maximum ratio of debt to earnings, a minimum level of interest cover and a maximum level of capital expenditure.
The covenants measured these as a number and had to show performance better than a defined scale, which changed over the period of the facilities.
The Group showed ratios better than those required by the relevant agreements.
Failure to satisfy these covenants would have allowed the lenders to call for immediate repayment of loans made to the Group.

The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily forward currency contracts.
This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments: how those risks arise: the objectives, policies and processes used by the Group for managing the risks: and the methods used to measure the risks.
Overview of treasury policy The Group manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of financial instruments by the application of its treasury policy.
The Groups treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that: appropriate financial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Groups businesses: the financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure is understood, measured and managed appropriately: and treasury operates as a cost centre and that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Aside from the redemption of virtually all of the Groups foreign currency borrowings in advance of the significant weakening of Sterling, there have been no significant changes in the Groups exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures, in the year ended 31 March 2009 compared to the year ended 31 March 2008.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
Operating within the strict controls of the Groups treasury policy, the Treasury Department manages this risk, ensuring that sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group.
In addition to the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits.
Core funding and guarantee issuance is provided by a bank facility which matures in July 2013.
This facility is described further in Note 21 ii, including the amount of undrawn committed facilities available which is a key measure of the Groups liquidity.
Liquidity management is centralised through cash pooling arrangements and inter-company funding structures, under the control of the Treasury Department.
In countries where cash pooling arrangements cannot be implemented, cash balances are monitored to ensure that surplus amounts are repatriated and deficits adequately funded.
The Treasury Department maintains sufficient back-up liquidity in the form of available cash balances and committed facilities.
Standard business practices include the strict application of credit control procedures to ensure the collection of cash from customers in accordance with agreed credit periods and terms that result in positive cash flows over the life of a construction or long-term service provision contract whenever possible.
82 | Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2009 and 2008 based on contractual undiscounted payments: Up to 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years 5 years Total 31 March 2009 m m m m m m m Long-term bank and other loans 9 9 Finance leases 1 1 Provisions 10 7 6 3 2 10 38 Trade and other payables 459 7 1 1 468 Derivative financial instruments: Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 4 4 Unrecognised liabilities: Operating lease commitments 50 38 30 23 19 66 226 532 53 37 26 21 77 746 Up to 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years 5 years Total 31 March 2008 m m m m m m m Long-term bank and other loans 7 157 164 Finance leases 1 1 Provisions 6 5 3 3 4 8 29 Trade and other payables 429 4 1 2 1 437 Derivative financial instruments: Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 1 1 Unrecognised liabilities: Operating lease commitments 32 24 22 18 15 72 183 469 40 183 23 19 81 815 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to risk arising from the effect of changes in floating interest rates on the level of interest it pays on its borrowings and receives on its cash deposits.
The Groups policy is to set the proportion of fixedand floating-rate debt, taking into account several factors including: the financial leverage of the Group: the profitability of the Group in relation to the business cycle: and the absolute levels of interest rates.
To implement this policy the Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, in line with the Group having a net cash position, Invensys had no significant fixed rate borrowings.
The interest rate profiles of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 and 21 respectively.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate cash and borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008.
Effect on profit Effect on profit before tax: before tax: increase increase Increase decrease decrease decrease 2009 2008 m m Euro 1% 0 0.1 US dollar 1% 0.5 0.7 Euro 1% 0 0.1 US dollar 1% 0.5 0.7 Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | 83 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Currency risk Transaction exposure Currency transaction exposure arises when the Groups businesses face revenues or costs in a currency other than their own.
The incidence of this risk varies across the Group and is subject to change.
Usually however, the majority of revenues and costs will be in the functional currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction.
Where this is not the case and the exposure is significant, it is the Groups policy for businesses to hedge their exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk in making bids, particularly on major contracts.
The assumption of a specific exchange rate within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should a bid be successful: this risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage transaction exposure.
Translation exposure The majority of the Groups operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, particularly US dollars.
As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results.
This risk is not hedged directly, but to the extent that the Group has debt, any that is held in foreign currency would reduce the level of net assets exposed to currency fluctuations.
The interest expense of any such debt would then also reduce the level of earnings exposed to exchange rate movements.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows: US dollar Euro Other excl GBP US dollar Euro Other excl GBP 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 As at 31 March m m m m m m Net assets of non-GBP functional currency entities 322 106 170 157 13 189 Net unhedged monetary assets not held in entities functional currencies 93 4 13 54 97 81 Gross exposure 415 102 183 211 110 270 The significant exchange rates that applied during the year are set out in Note 37.
Currency risk sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and euro exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of: the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the sterling value of monetary assets and liabilities not held in entities functional currencies assuming year end levels of such items are held constant : and the Groups equity due to changes in the sterling value of year end net assets held by non-GBP functional currency entities.

The effect on equity is derived by applying the assumed strengthening weakening percentage to the net assets of Group entities whose functional currency is other than sterling.
Price risk The Groups exposure to changing market prices on the value of financial instruments has an impact on the carrying value of financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale and on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group monitors changes in the carrying amounts of these assets and any resulting change in exposure to price risk in order to ensure that its investment in these assets remains appropriate.
On 31 March 2009, the total carrying value of these financial assets was nil 2008: 7 million, of which 6 million related to investments in unlisted securities as described in Note 16.
These securities were sold during the year.
84 | Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Credit risk The Group is exposed to risk if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Such a risk arises principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other financial institutions.
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as to control exposure to any territory or institution.
As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by treasury.
Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance sheet date see i on page 86. Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 30.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Details of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements in respect of receivables are given in Note 19.
Based on past experience, the directors believe that there is no significant credit risk associated with receivables that are neither past due nor impaired.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and performs credit verification procedures on all customers.
Receivable balances, including uninvoiced receivables reported as amounts due from contract customers, are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The Group has not renegotiated the terms of any significant financial assets such that those assets would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Derivatives Derivatives are used to manage the interest rate and currency risks described above and further detail is provided below.
Capital management The credit facility in place at 31 March 2009 provides liquidity for the Group until July 2013 and supports the objectives of the Group.
This facility is described further in Note 21 ii.
Investigations are continually undertaken to review alternative financing arrangements.
In making those considerations the Board takes into account the cost of any refinancing compared to the benefits, which include terms and conditions, the cost of funding and repayment schedules.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008.
The Groups capital structure is as follows: 2009 2008 m m 1 As at 31 March restated 2 Capital employed 354 307 Cash and cash equivalents 296 235 Borrowings 10 162 Net cash 286 73 Total equity funds 640 380 Comprising: Equity holders of parent 553 311 Minority interests 87 69 640 380 1 Restated for the IFRIC 14 adjustment to the pension liabilities.
2 Includes other current financial assets of 23 million 2008: nil.
On 21 January 2009, Invensys completed a restructuring of its reserves which facilitates the payment of dividends from earnings realised after that date.
Net cash was 286 million 2008: 73 million with an additional 23 million of other current financial assets resulting in net cash and deposits of 309 million.
The improvement of 213 million is largely due to the free cash flow of 296 million which includes a receipt of 95 million from the PPP settlement and 32 million proceeds from the sale of financial investments.
Offsetting these are payments of 50 million for the acquisitions of SAT Corporation and Quantum Engineering Inc. Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | 85 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued i Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates.
Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 March was: Book Fair Book Fair value value value value 2009 2009 2008 2008 Notes m m m m Financial assets Available-for-sale investments 16 1 1 1 1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: held for trading 16 6 6 Held-to-maturity financial assets 16 23 23 1 Loans and receivables: Trade and other receivables 19 482 482 501 501 1 Cash and cash equivalents 20 296 296 235 235 Derivative financial instruments: Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 22ii 2 2 1 1 804 804 744 744 Financial liabilities Short-term bank and other loans 9 9 Long-term bank and other loans 21 161 161 Finance leases 30 1 1 1 1 1 Provisions 24 37 37 29 29 1 Trade and other payables 26 468 468 437 437 Derivative financial instruments: Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 22ii 4 4 1 1 519 519 629 629 1 The directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to customers.
The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties.
At 31 March 2009, the maximum credit risk to the Group arising from these guarantees was 2 million 2008: 3 million, being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding at that date.
Financial assets with a carrying value of up to 1 million 2008: 156 million are subject to charges relating to such loans.
ii Derivative financial instruments A summary of derivative financial instruments is as follows: Fair Fair value value 2009 2008 m m Derivative assets 2 1 Derivative liabilities 4 1 2 86 | Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The Group uses derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, currency transaction exposure and currency translation exposure.
The figures in the above table are analysed by category as set out below: Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps were not used during the year ended 31 March 2009.
During the year ended 31 March 2008 the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its US$ denominated bank borrowings.
The last of these swaps expired in October 2007.
No interest rate swaps were in place at 31 March 2008.
During the year ended 31 March 2008, these instruments were designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
nil was transferred to the income statement during the year to 31 March 2008 in respect of hedged interest cash flows.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the Groups businesses in currencies other than their own functional currency.
The turnover i. e. notional principal of such derivatives which typically have a term of less than one year, excluding swaps, in the year to 31 March 2009 was 273 million 2008: 258 million and their fair value at 31 March was: Fair Fair value value 2009 2008 m m Derivative assets 2 1 Derivative liabilities 4 2 1 All of these instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
2 million relating to hedged cash flows that have not yet impacted the income statement have been deferred and recognised in equity at 31 March 2009 2008: nil.
4 million expense 2008: 2 million gain has been transferred to the income statement during the year to 31 March 2009 in respect of contracts which matured.
This amount is included within cost of sales in the income statement.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge translation exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to match the currency profile of its net debt to that of its net assets, revenue and earnings and ensure that it has sufficient cash available to meet its payment obligations by currency as they fall due.
The fair value of such derivatives which typically have a term of less than one year is set out below: Fair Fair value value 2009 2008 m m Derivative liabilities 1 1 The currency assets and liabilities created by such derivatives at 31 March were: Net assets Net assets Assets Liabilities liabilities Assets Liabilities liabilities 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 m m m m m m Sterling 35 35 32 32 Euro 19 19 47 47 United States dollar 24 24 2 2 Japanese yen 8 8 13 13 Other 26 4 22 26 23 3 58 58 71 72 1 Changes in the fair value of such derivatives are taken directly to the income statement.
8 million was charged to foreign exchange losses in the income statement in the year to 31 March 2009 2008: 13 million credit, see Note 7. iii Ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement No amounts were recognised in the income statement relating to the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges 2008: nil.

Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle.
The actual amount of costs that will be incurred will depend upon the level and nature of future claims.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably.
This generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant property and the costs of other onerous contracts.
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
The provisions represent the best estimate of the unavoidable costs remaining under the current contractual terms of the contracts.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next 15 years.
Other provisions principally relate to legal claims, claims under workers compensation or similar employee disability benefit schemes and other miscellaneous obligations.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next five years.
The costs are estimated based on the expected outcome of the legal claim or obligation.
The amount of the final liability and timing of payment, if any, is dependent upon the final outcome of any litigation or other negotiation involved.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value.
88 | Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution schemes The Group operates many defined contribution schemes.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to 12 million 2008: 11 million.
At 31 March 2009, there were 1 million 2008: 1 million of outstanding contributions included in payables.
ii Defined benefit schemes general The Group operates many funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme.
There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world.
The main UK and US schemes are final salary in nature.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme.
The Invensys Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
These assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The Trustee Board is made up of nine directors, four nominated by the Company and five by the members.
The Company is responsible for appointing the Chairman from the Board.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 31 March 2008 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities.
This latest valuation has not made a significant change to the Schemes funding plan for the next three years.
The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate and inflation on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries.
Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually by an actuary, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired former employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2009 to reflect market conditions and material events in the plans.
iii Defined benefit schemes major assumptions The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows: As at March 2009 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US 1 Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other % % % % % Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.35 4.00 3.93 2.88 2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.60 2.86 2.44 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.30 7.75 6.39 7.75 6.39 Inflation rate 3.10 2.50 2.83 2.35 As at March 2008 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US 1 Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other % % % % % Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.95 4.00 3.81 1.48 2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.80 2.78 1.11 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.10 6.55 6.07 6.55 5.93 Inflation rate 3.70 2.50 3.10 2.17 1 The assumptions used for medical trend rates for beneficiaries of the US healthcare scheme were 8.5% per annum, declining to an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2009 2008: 9.5% declining to 5.0%: 2007: 9.0% declining to 5.0%.
2 The inflationary pension increases granted for the UK scheme in the year were 3.10% 2008: 3.70%: 2007: 3.20%.
The pension increase assumptions used are in line with RPI, subject to a floor of 3.0% and a ceiling of 5.0%.
Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | 89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued iii Defined benefit schemes major assumptions continued As at March 2007 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US 1 Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other % % % % % Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.45 4.00 3.91 1.44 2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.50 2.41 0.94 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.35 5.95 5.30 5.95 5.36 Inflation rate 3.20 2.50 2.74 2.10 1 The 2009 assumptions used for medical trend rates for beneficiaries of the US healthcare scheme were 8.5% per annum, declining to an ultimate rate of 4.5% 2008: 9.5% declining to 5.0%: 2007: 9.0% declining to 5.0%.
The demographic assumptions which were consistently applied for the main schemes are as follows: Invensys Pension Scheme UK Standard actuarial mortality tables PA92 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections.
Probability of death at each age was multiplied by 122% for males and 135% for females.
Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a floor of 1.00% for males and 1.25% for females.
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below: Years Retiring today at age 65: Male 20.9 Female 23.3 Retiring in 20 years at age 65: Male 22.7 Female 25.6 Invensys Pension Plan US The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee annuitants, projected to 2006 using projection scale AA.
Sensitivities Invensys Pension Scheme UK The Invensys Pension Scheme UK is the largest scheme within the Group, representing 75% of gross liabilities of all defined benefit schemes.
The principal sensitivities, with all other variables held constant, are illustrated below: Defined benefit Net 1 obligation Assets effect m m m A 0.1% increase in the assumed inflation rate would have the following effect: Increase in defined benefit obligation increase in scheme assets 40 25 15 A 0.1% decrease in the assumed discount rate would have the following effect: Increase in defined benefit obligation increase in scheme assets 50 45 5 A 1 year extension to the pensioners lives would have the following effect: Increase in defined benefit obligation 115 115 Applying an additional 0.25% underpin to the improvement in mortality would have the following effect: Increase in defined benefit obligation 25 25 1 The movement of assets in this table shows the estimated impact on asset values arising from a change of market conditions consistent with the change in discount rate and inflation assumptions shown.
US healthcare scheme Increase Decrease A 1% movement in the assumed rate of increase in US healthcare costs would have the following effects: m m US healthcare scheme defined benefit obligation: increase decrease 1.56 1.40 90 | Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 iv Adoption of IFRIC 14 As stated in the accounting policies, the Group has adopted IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction in these Financial Statements.
In line with the transitional provisions of IFRIC 14, the change in accounting policy is effective from 1 April 2008, with the comparatives restated accordingly.
Only the UK Main Pension Scheme has been affected by the adoption.
The Group is committed to making payments to the Invensys Pension Scheme under a deficit funding plan agreed with the Trustees.
Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the Scheme as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, IFRIC 14 requires a provision to be made for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any surplus on the Invensys Pension Scheme ultimately repaid by the Trustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid.
IFRIC 14 effectively requires a liability for this tax to be recognised at the relevant balance sheet date.
At 1 April 2007, the net defined benefit obligation was 243 million, and the net present value of liabilities arising from future minimum funding requirements was 219 million.
After taking account of those future funding requirements, the net position remains a deficit, therefore there is no surplus to be recovered and hence no liability to tax thereon.
The impact therefore of adopting IFRIC 14 as at 1 April 2007 is nil.
The table below shows the position at each of the subsequent balance sheet dates.
2009 2008 As at 31 March m m IAS 19 net defined benefit obligation 8 10 Future minimum funding requirements 254 198 Potential future pension surplus 246 188 Irrecoverable element of potential future pension surplus 86 66 Recoverable element of potential future pension surplus 160 122 Movement in irrecoverable element of potential future pension surplus 20 66 The net pension liability has been restated to reflect the liability arising on the irrecoverable element of the potential pension surplus for the two years presented.
The movement in the irrecoverable element of the potential pension surplus is taken directly to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

This is an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings.
If the UK Main Pension Scheme were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 to fund the UK Main Pension Scheme up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme members with an insurer.
This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes.
The deficit in the UK Main Pension Scheme calculated on a winding up basis was approximately 1.4 billion as at 31 March 2008, the date of the last actuarial valuation.
This will be reviewed and updated at the next valuation.

In respect of the UK Main Pension Scheme, Government and Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium has been applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments.
Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The investment strategy determined by the Trustees of the Invensys Pension Scheme continues to reflect the mature nature of the Scheme with assets predominantly invested in bonds or bond like investments.

In addition, the Company will continue to make annual supplemental contributions to the scheme.
These amount to 37 million in the year ending 31 March 2010, 38 million in the year ending 31 March 2011 and 39 million in the year ending 31 March 2012 increasing by 1 million per annum until 31 March 2014 and then 2 million per annum thereafter until 2017.
Where the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed 1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional contributions to the UK Main Pension Scheme.
The funding plan is subject to revision after the next triennial valuation which will have a reference date of 31 March 2011.
Under the US plan, the Companys agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provided for additional contributions of 4% of net proceeds from future disposals.

Interest payable on the Groups major borrowing facilities is settled quarterly throughout the financial year.
Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors, customer advances not related to construction contracts, payments received from customers in advance of work performed on construction contracts and commissions payable.
The majority of non-current other payables will mature in more than one year but in less than two years: there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years.
The maturity profile of trade and other payables classified as financial liabilities is given in Note 22.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

Nature and purpose of other reserves Share premium account This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when the Company repurchased its own shares for cancellation as part of a return of capital programme and is non-distributable.
Subsequently, in the year ended 31 March 2005, 3,499,780,822 deferred shares of 24p each were cancelled, in accordance with their terms of issue.
The total balance on the reserve was cancelled as part of the Court approved capital reduction on 22 January 2009.
Capital reserve Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and is non-distributable.

29 Share-based payment plans The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as detailed below: Plans for senior employees Executive share options Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme Grant details An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost.
Options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the Companys shares over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: a for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share EPS performance of RPI 12% over a three year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of which is the year preceding that in which the option will lapse: and b for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder return TSR performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a performance period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant.
40% would be exercisable if the median position is achieved, rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved.
Between these two points the option would vest on a straight-line basis.
If the performance condition is not met in full at the first measurement then it would be retested against the fixed base in years four and five.
If the median position is not achieved by the end of the fifth year the option would lapse.
No performance conditions are attached to the option granted to Mr Henriksson under a separate arrangement on 1 June 2004.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.

Long-term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no or nominal cost.
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: a a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment unless the Company determines otherwise : b a conditional share award: or c a cash award granted in respect of a notional number of shares.
Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period.
For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years: for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: TSR test TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee with no retesting opportunities.
TSR must rank at the median position when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be available subject to the retention period, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved.
Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
If at least the median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse.
The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant: and awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: a for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness: b for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: 1 achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets: and 2 efficient management of legacy liability items: and c for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met: 1 relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group: and 2 efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use No awards were granted under this scheme during the year ended 31 March 2009.
Given that no further awards could be granted under the LTIP after July 2008, a new share-based long-term incentive plan, the Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan was established and approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
Details of this scheme are given below.
Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2008 are detailed below: LTIP awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2008 Total number of awards granted 229,073 Weighted average fair value 121.87p Exercise price n a Expected volatility n a 1 Weighted average expected award life 1.5 years Expected dividend yield 0% Risk free interest rate n a 1 During the year ended 31 March 2008, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to depart from the rules of the 1998 LTIP in a specific termination case not related to an executive director.
This award of 143,179 shares was therefore treated as a forfeiture of the original award, followed by a new grant with a life of three months only, representing the date of agreement to the date of termination.
This resulted in a shorter weighted average expected award life than is usual.
The remaining grants during the year were therefore 85,894 shares.

Vesting requirements Performance requirements: awards will be subject to two independent performance conditions.
For executive directors a 50% of an award will be based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index: and b 50% of an award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Groups earnings per share.
For all other participants a 35% of an award will be based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index: and b 35% of an award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Groups earnings per share.
There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Group must be satisfactory.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions, in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use The 2007 LTIP is used as the Groups main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted.
The first grants under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008.

2007 CEO Special Award Special Award Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007 08 base salary.
The Special Award is subject to a three-year performance period.
50% of vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: the performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance.
Vesting in each layer will be on a straight line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile.
This has been calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as means outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 i. e. 40%.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases.

All awards are satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
For 2008 09 onwards the DSP is only used for executive directors and members of the Office of the CEO: in all other respects the same terms apply as outlined in the previous paragraph.
