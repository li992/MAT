Retirement benefit plans continued The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2009, the schemes assets did not include any ordinary shares of the company.
At 31 March 2008, 10m ordinary shares of the company were included within the schemes assets, with a market value of 22m.
The group occupies two properties owned by the BTPS scheme on which an annual rental of 0.1m is payable 2008: 0.1m.
The expected long-term rate of return and fair values of the assets of the BTPS at 31 March were: 2009 2008 Expected Expected long-term long-term rate of return rate of return per annum Asset fair value Target per annum Asset fair value Target % bn % % % bn % % UK equities 8.5 3.2 11 11 8.5 6.2 17 23 Non-UK equities 8.5 5.9 20 22 8.5 10.5 28 28 Fixed-interest securities 5.9 6.6 22 20 5.7 7.1 19 15 Index-linked securities 4.0 4.4 15 15 4.6 3.6 10 10 Property 7.0 3.2 11 12 7.0 5.2 14 13 Alternative assets 7.0 5.2 18 20 7.2 2.9 8 11 Cash and other 3.5 0.8 3 5.0 1.8 4 6.7 29.3 100 100 7.1 37.3 100 100 The assumption for the expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The expected returns on xed interest and index-linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
Alternative asset classes include commodities and hedge funds.
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income.

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS scheme liabilities The assumed discount rate, mortality rates and salary increases all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Impact on liability Decrease increase bn 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.2 salary increases 0.3 Additional 1 year increase to life expectancy 1.3 124 BT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FORM 20-F
