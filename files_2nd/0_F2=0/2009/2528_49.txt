The notional values shown are the notional amounts of the derivatives identied.
The Groups portfolio of derivatives is diversied by maturity, counterparty and type.
Natural offsets between transactions within the portfolio and the designation of certain derivatives as hedges signicantly reduce the risk of income statement volatility.
The Group manages credit risk by diversifying its exposures across a wide number of counterparties, such that the maximum exposure to any individual counterparty was less than 12% of the total asset value of instruments at the end of the period.
Treasury policies ensure that transactions are only effected with strong relationship banks and all counterparties at the end of the period carried a credit rating of BBB or better.
Included within the fair value of forward exchange contracts are a number of US dollar-denominated forward exchange contracts which the Group has taken out with counterparty banks on behalf of two of its joint ventures: The History Channel UK and Chelsea Digital Media Limited.
On the same dates as these forward contracts were entered into, the Group entered into equal and opposite forward contracts with the respective joint ventures.
As a result, the net fair value of these contracts to the Group was nil 2008: nil.
The gross sterling equivalent face value of these forward contracts at 30 June 2009 was 3 million 2008: 5 million.
Group treasury activity The Groups treasury function is responsible for raising finance for the Groups operations, together with associated liquidity management and the management of foreign exchange, interest rate and credit risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by both the Audit Committee and the Board, which receive regular updates of treasury activity.
Derivative instruments are transacted for risk management purposes only.
It is the Groups policy that all hedging is to cover known risks and that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Regular and frequent reporting to management is required for all transactions and exposures, and the internal control environment is subject to periodic review by the Groups internal audit team.

Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash ow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts: Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash ows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates: and The fair value of obligations under finance leases and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present value.
