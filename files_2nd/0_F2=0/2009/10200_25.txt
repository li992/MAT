The operating pro t for each segment takes into account the transfer pricing agreements in place between the Group companies.
Segment assets include goodwill, property, plant and equipment, stocks, debtors, operating cash and other intangible assets and exclude deferred tax assets.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude current and deferred tax liabilities.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment.

Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs which represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
It has been determined that the three geographical segments, which form the primary reporting format each equate to a CGU.
For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
No impairment charge was required in the year 2008: $Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is $Nil 2008: $Nil.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
These are based on the forecast operating cash ows for the next five years based on approved budgets and plans.
These budgets and plans are based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that re ects the market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks speci c to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was 11% 2008: 8.9%.
Micro Focus Annual Report and 66 International plc Accounts 2009 The long-term operating margin assumed for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
In these instances, expected future improvements from sustainable cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The longterm operating margin applied to CGUs was 38.6% 2008: 35.6% Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 1.5% 2008: 3%.
Long-term growth and discount rates are applied consistently across all CGUs as: The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics: Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs: Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs: and The Group has no debt and therefore no gearing across all CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis as at 30 April 2009 has indicated that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a signi cant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see accounting policy 1Hd.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual debtor.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2009, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2009, trade receivables of $13.1 million 2008: $7.8 million were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 35 days in excess of due date 2008: 32 days.
As at 30 April 2009, trade receivables of $1.6 million 2008: $1.1 million were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $1.6 million 2008: $1.2 million.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2009 2008 $000 $000 Three to four months 321 434 Over four months 1,272 692 Total 1,593 1,126 Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2009 2008 $000 $000 At 1 May 2008 1,217 242 Provision for receivables impairment 643 718 Acquisition of subsidiaries 114 581 Receivables written off as uncollectable 275 430 Exchange adjustments 106 106 At 30 April 2009 1,593 1,217 14 Cash and cash equivalents 2009 2008 $000 $000 Cash at bank and in hand 18,267 25,626 Short-term bank deposits 53,302 66,779 Total 71,569 92,405 The effective interest rate on short-term deposits was 0.4% 2008: 2.8% and these deposits have an average maturity of one day 2008: three days.
At 30 April 2009, the carrying amount approximates to the fair value of the instrument due to the instrument bearing interest at market rates and or the short-term nature of the instrument.

Such exposures re ect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
Note 3 shows the impact of foreign exchange gains in the year.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and bene ts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.
At 30 April 2009, the Group did not have net debt and therefore no gearing.
On 13 May 2008, the Company entered into a $40 million credit facility with HSBC Bank Plc and Lloyds TSB Bank plc for general corporate purposes.
The facility expired on 12 May 2009.
On 6 May 2009, the Company entered into a $175 million credit facility provided through a syndicated loan consortium comprising Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc to assist with the funding of acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.
On 12 June 2009, the Company entered into a supplemental agreement for an additional $40 million to assist with the acquisition of Borland Software Corporation at an increased offer price.
