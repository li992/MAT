EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: 2009 2008 Weighted Earnings Weighted Earnings average per average per number of ordinary number of ordinary Earnings shares share Earnings shares share From continuing operations 000 pence 000 pence For basic earnings per ordinary share 28,970 99,711,536 29.0 54,916 99,621,531 55.1 For diluted earnings per ordinary share 28,970 100,951,386 28.7 54,916 100,889,516 54.5 2009 2008 Weighted Earnings Weighted Earnings average per average per number of ordinary number of ordinary Earnings shares share Earnings shares share From discontinued operations 000 pence 000 pence For basic earnings per ordinary share 5,569 99,711,536 5.6 2,188 99,621,531 2.2 For diluted earnings per ordinary share 5,569 100,951,386 5.5 2,188 100,889,516 2.2 2009 2008 Weighted Earnings Weighted Earnings average per average per number of ordinary number of ordinary Earnings shares share Earnings shares share From total operations 000 pence 000 pence For basic earnings per ordinary share 34,539 99,711,536 34.6 52,728 99,621,531 52.9 For diluted earnings per ordinary share 34,539 100,951,386 34.2 52,728 100,889,516 52.3 The difference between the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the dilutive effect of the Companys Performance Share Plan, Save As You Earn Scheme and the Chairmans award.

GOODWILL Group 2009 2008 000 000 Cost and net book value at 1 January and 31 December 39,107 39,107 Accumulated amortisation is nil at 1 January and 31 December 2009.
Existing goodwill relates entirely to the initial purchase of the offshore business and has been allocated to that business, which is considered to be a single cash generating unit.
Upon further acquisitions goodwill acquired in a business will be allocated to the cash generating units that expect to benefit from that business acquired.
The basis on which the recoverable amount has been determined is the value in use.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following years operating budget approved by the directors and preliminary forecasts for the two years thereafter.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10%.
In determining the discount rate, management considered the Groups weighted average cost of capital and the Groups incremental borrowing rates.
The discount rate best reflects the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the cash generating units.
Consideration has also been given to other risks such as currency risk and country risk.
Discounted cash flow projections for the next three years exceed the carrying value of Goodwill and other non-current assets and therefore no impairment of goodwill is evident as at 31 December 2009.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount, and therefore there are no key assumptions that require disclosure.
During the year property, plant and equipment with a net book value of 4,056,000 was disposed of as part of the sale of FlexSteel.
Included in the depreciation charge for the year is 1,033,000 in respect of those assets.
The Company holds no property plant or equipment.

Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes the bulk of its business in Sterling or in the local currency of its overseas operations.
Trade carried out in any other currency is by exception and as such any exposure to transactional currency risk can be easily identified.
In such circumstances natural hedges are first sought and if significant residual exposure exists, it is hedged using derivative financial instruments.
There were no such contracts in existence at the year end.
The Group has considerably expanded its activities in Brazil during the current and prior years.
With this expansion it has developed a significant Brazilian Real denominated operating cost base, a potential exposure exists to the extent that local currency sales fall below this level.
In addition to this, a further exposure exists within the Group due to US dollar and Euro denominated material costs: this exposure exists to the extent that these costs are not covered by corresponding revenues.
In both 2008 and 2009, Euro denominated exposure was not significant.
Although the Group did not hold any financial instruments to hedge currency risk at the balance sheet date, the increased activity in Brazil did necessitate the hedging of consequent currency exposures during the second half of 2009.
The Group has significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities by virtue of its overseas operations.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the Brazilian Real and US Dollar.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% 2008: 10% increase in Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies, being managements reasonable assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
Where assets exceed liabilities in respect of monetary items denominated in a foreign currency, a 10% increase in Sterling against that currency results in a reduction of profit and or other equity.
For a 10% weakening of Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
Real impact US Dollar impact 2009 2008 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 Recognised in equity 1,340 587 41 31 Recognised in profit 386 431 Interest rate risk management and sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
At the period end fixed interest rate loans represented 19% 2008: 91% of total borrowings.
The Group had no interest rate swaps at the year end.
If interest rates had been 0.5% 2008: 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2009 would decrease increase by 209,000 2008: decrease increase by 123,000.
0.5% is managements reasonable assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group contracts all of its significant business in such a way that it receives regular stage payments from its customers that are appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract.
The payment profile is approved by senior management in advance of accepting the contract and is monitored subsequent to acceptance at regular intervals.
This approach and the Groups customer profile which consists largely of national and international oil companies with well established and substantial credit histories, significantly mitigates the risk of financial loss from default.
At 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 there were credit risks associated with the concentration of the offshore business into a limited number of large contracts with a limited number of customers and counterparties.
Information about these major customers and their geographic profile is included in note 5.
No significant unrecovered receivables have arisen as a result of this risk.
At 31 December 2009 past due but not impaired receivables totalled 10,593,000 2008: 42,606,000, of which 9,995,000 has been received since the year end.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral obtained.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Liquidity risk management The Group was contractually obliged to make repayments of principal and payments of interest at 31 December as detailed below: In the In the Within one year second third to After five or on demand year fifth years years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2009 Bank borrowings term loan 11,783 11,473 41,163 64,419 Rio State Government loan 807 1,591 6,071 10,557 19,026 12,590 13,064 47,234 10,557 83,445 In the In the Within one year second third to After five or on demand year fifth years years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2008 Bank overdrafts 7,274 7,274 Bank borrowings 1,767 1,767 61,123 64,657 Rio State Government loan 618 618 4,303 9,342 14,881 9,659 2,385 65,426 9,342 86,812 Payments of interest are calculated using the interest rates applicable as at 31 December.

The directors therefore do not consider the Companys historic share price volatility to be a suitable basis on which to set an expectation for the purpose of option valuations.
Therefore the expected share price volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities in the share prices of a selection of UK companies operating in the same industry as the Group.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural conditions and forfeiture.
The risk free rate has been determined by reference to yields on UK government gilts.
