Derivative financial instruments Categories of financial instruments The table below details the categories of fi financial instruments across the Group and the carrying values of each category: 2009 2008 Carrying Carrying value value m m Financial assets: Fair value through profit and loss held for trading 0.1 20.5 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 2.4 0.4 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents 251.3 293.1 253.8 314.0 Financial liabilities Fair value through profit and loss held for trading 0.1 1.4 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 57.7 127.5 Amortised cost 617.0 786.1 674.8 915.0 The amounts detailed above as fair value through profit and loss held for trading do not relate to speculative transactions.
They relate to foreign exchange contracts which are not designated in a formal hedging relationship and are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc Company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash management structure.
Derivative financial instruments The fair values of all derivative fi financial instruments shown in the table below are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date and are held as assets and liabilities within other receivables and other payables.
The notional amounts of the derivative fi financial instruments detailed in the table below are based on the contractual gross amounts as at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative fi financial instruments in the table below are categorised within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as confi rmation that the fair values have been calculated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group does not have any derivative fi financial instruments which would be categorised as level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

104 Shareholder information Financial Risk Factors Our activities expose us to a variety of fi financial risks: market risk including currency risk and cash fl ow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall our risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of fi financial markets and seeks to manage and minimise potential fi financial risks through the use of derivative fi financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying fi financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This department identifi es, evaluates and hedges fi financial risks in close co-operation with our subsidiaries.
The treasury policies cover specifi c areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative fi financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined further as described on page 43.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two fi financial covenant requirements under its two main credit facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
In the primary $900 million facility the Group has the option of relaxing the fi financial covenants for a period of time if certain acquisition criteria are met.
Following the acquisition of Hawker Beechcraft in 2008 these criteria were met and the Group exercised this option to increase the net debt to EBITDA covenant to 4.25 times at the 31 December 2008 testing date and to 4.0 times at the 30 June and 31 December 2009 testing dates.
From 30 June 2010 this covenant will revert to 3.5 times.
This acquisition spike is not incorporated, and therefore not available, under the $175 million facility.
Derivative financial instruments continued Market Risk Market risk is the risk of adverse fi financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash fl ows of fi financial instruments from fl uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defi ned policies for the management of these risks and the management of these risks includes the use of derivative fi financial instruments.
i Foreign Exchange Risk The Group has signifi cant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash fl ows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in which the operations are located.
The Group is, therefore, exposed to foreign currency translation risk from the translation of these overseas operations fi financial statements into sterling.
During 2009 the Board reviewed its foreign currency translation policy and identifi ed the protection of the net debt to EBITDA fi financial ratio as a priority rather than minimising volatility in shareholders funds.
It was therefore decided that in future the balance sheet foreign currency translation exposure will only be hedged using borrowings and new derivative fi financial instruments will not be used.
The Board also approved a transition plan to ensure that the existing cross currency swap book is being actively managed.
The Board decided that the income statement translation exposure should remain unhedged, since such hedges have only a temporary eff ect.
As at 31 December 2009 the majority of the Groups net borrowings were denominated in US Dollars as detailed in the table below: 2009 2008 US Dollar Euros Sterling Other Total US Dollar Euros Sterling Other Total m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 66.8 11.6 35.5 1.5 115.4 57.2 11.0 28.7 1.5 98.4 Debt and finance leases 471.0 2.9 30.3 2.8 507.0 623.4 1.2 24.8 3.4 652.8 Net debt 404.2 8.7 5.2 1.3 391.6 566.2 9.8 3.9 1.9 554.4 At the end of 2009 the Group had outstanding $400 million 2008: $550 million and 50 million 2008: 50 million of cross currency swaps.
During 2009 $150 million of cross currency swaps were closed out early at a cash cost of 2.9 million.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and eff ective as net investment hedges at the 2009 year end amounting to a payable of 47.7 million 2008: payable 97.7 million has been deferred in equity.
The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging signifi cant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where signifi cant foreign currency exposures exist then we generally will also cover a percentage of the projected foreign currency fl ows depending on the certainty of these cash fl ows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting monthly reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with signifi cant foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash fl ows over the life of the policy.
The pre-determined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with our relationship banks.

A loss of 5.7 million 2008: loss 5.5 million has been transferred to the income statement in respect of contracts that matured during the period.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash fl ow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency fl ows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash fl ow hedges amounting to 17.8 million 2008: 74.1 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
The net impact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similar but opposite eff ect on administrative expenses.
ii Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Groups debt and cash balances are based on fl oating interest rates which expose the Group to cash fl ow interest rate risk.
A very small proportion of the Groups borrowings 2.8 million is issued at fi xed interest rates and, therefore, overall the Group is not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to use a combination of debt and derivative instruments to fi x proportions of the exposure for varying periods based upon the maturity profi le and the expectation of future interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to the movements on these fl oating interest rates.

the Company 98 Notes to the Company As at 31 December 2009 and 2008 the Group had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These are within the maximum limits permissible under financial statements our policy and these exposures are continually monitored and reported.
No individual exposure is considered signifi cant in the ordinary course of treasury 102 Principal subsidiary management activity and the Group does not expect any signifi cant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
undertakings 103 Five year summary Commercial Related Credit Risk The Groups exposure to commercial related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and fi finance lease receivables and the amounts presented in the 104 Shareholder information balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled by a number of diff erent ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any signifi cant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 12.
Liquidity Risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash fl ow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of highly rated banks to mitigate this risk further.
Headroom on our facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and liquidity.
The Groups committed facilities are a $175 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2011 and a $900 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2012.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and cash fl ow interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: t he balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative instruments as cash and debt balances are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: c hanges in the carrying value of derivative fi financial instruments designated as cash fl ow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net fl oating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative fi financial instruments not in hedging relationships only aff ect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative fi financial instruments designated as hedges are fully eff ective with no impact on the income statement: all debt is fl oating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the fl oating rate leg of any swap or any fl oating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rates aff ects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: t he sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances at plc company only as at the balance sheet date and assumed this is the position for a full 12-month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used as over the last three years fl oating $ interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.
Using the above assumptions the following table shows the illustrative eff ect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, before the eff ects of tax.

The translation impact on profi t before tax in the Groups income statement from the movement in exchange rates is approximately 0.35 million for each 1 cent movement in the $ exchange rate.
