9 Intangible assets continued Management has also considered the key sensitivities that impact future cash flows.
The key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent relates to the underlying customer base.
In particular the assumptions are sensitive to customer attrition and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established.
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management considers that it is unlikely that a change in key assumptions would result in impairment, as it is reasonable to assume that there will not be a major deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact future cash flows.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.
