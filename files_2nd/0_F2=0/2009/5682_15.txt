Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies General information Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC the company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom UK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the group and equity-account the groups interest in associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the entity and not about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 2.
In the current year, IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction is effective for the current period.
The adoption of this interpretation has not led to any changes in the groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new accounting standards, or amendments and interpretations to existing standards have not been applied as they are not yet effective: IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 : Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 : Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements relating to puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to eligible hedged items effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 : IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions effective for annual periods beginning on or after March 1 2007 : IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2008 : The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures.
In addition, certain other standards and interpretations were issued during the period which either do not apply to the group or are not expected to have any material effect.
Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
The directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this report as explained in detail on page 31.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Where the group owns a non-controlling interest in the equity share capital of a non-quoted company and does not exercise significant influence, it is held as an investment and stated in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The results of subsidiary and associated undertakings acquired during the year are incorporated from the effective date of acquisition.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method, with consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired being recorded at fair value.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the groups equity therein.
Minority interests consists of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 55 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The functional and presentation currency of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC and its UK subsidiaries is sterling.
The functional currency of subsidiaries and associates is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the weighted average exchange rates for the year and their balance sheets are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken to equity.
In the event of the disposal of an operation, the related cumulative translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period of disposal.
Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings and derivative instruments, to the extent that they are used to provide a hedge against the groups equity investments in overseas undertakings, are taken to equity together with the exchange difference arising on the net investment in those undertakings.
All other exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land do not depreciate Freehold buildings 2% Long-term leasehold premises over term of lease Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% 33% Motor vehicles 20% All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that have benefited from the acquisition.
Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and may not subsequently be reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on foreign subsidiary investments held in the consolidated balance sheet are retranslated into sterling at the applicable period end exchange rates.
Any exchange differences arising are taken directly to equity as part of the retranslation of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts having been tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP before October 1 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
56 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 1 Accounting policies continued Other intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
An intangible asset will be recognised as long as the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is charged so as to write off the costs of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line or reducing balance method.
All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The costs of acquiring and developing software that is not integral to the related hardware is capitalised separately as an intangible asset.
These intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis as appropriate over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Brands 20 30 years Data provider contracts 5 years Customer relationships 3 - 16 years Licences and software 3 years Subscription contracts 1 year Business combinations achieved in stages Where a business combination is achieved by more than one exchange transaction, goodwill is calculated separately for each transaction with the appropriate share of the acquirees net assets based on the net fair values at the time of each exchange transaction.
Any adjustment to an increase in fair values related to previously held interests is credited to the fair value reserve.
A decrease in carrying amounts arising on the revaluation of such assets is charged as an expense to the income statement to the extent that it exceeds the balance held in the fair value reserve, if any, relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.
Purchases and sale of shares in a controlled entity Where the groups interest in a controlled entity increases, which does not result in a change of control, the group calculates the goodwill arising as the difference between the cost of the additional interest acquired and the fair value of the groups interest in the subsidiarys net assets at the date of the change in interest.
All of the assets and liabilities are fair valued at the date of acquisition of the additional controlling stake.
Financial assets Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the income statement when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities and equity Committed borrowings and bank overdrafts Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the amounts received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value of the borrowings or overdraft to the extent they are not settled in the period which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 57 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Derivatives financial instruments The group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognised in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognised as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Liabilities in respect of put option agreements Liabilities for put options over the remaining minority interests in subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheet at their estimated discounted present value.
These discounts are unwound and charged to the income statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of IAS 12 Income tax and is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
No provision is made for temporary differences on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries or associates where the group has control and the reversal of the temporary difference is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
58 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, ex-gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions are based on the advice of independent actuaries.
Payments to the Euromoney Pension Plan and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan, both defined contribution pension schemes, are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The company operates the Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
The cost of providing benefits is determined by triennial valuations using the attained age method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
The company also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole to the individual entities, the company recognises an expense equal to its contributions payable in the period and does not recognise any unfunded liability of this pension scheme on its balance sheet.
Share-based payments The group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 Share-based payments has been applied to all grants of options after November 7 2002, that were unvested at October 1 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
For cash settled share-based payments a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value as determined at each balance sheet date.
Revenue Revenue represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
y Advertising revenues are recognised in the income statement on the date of publication.
y Subscription revenues are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
y Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the income statement over the period the event is run.
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line or other systematic basis as allowed by IAS 17 Leases.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Own shares held by Employees Share Ownership Trust Transactions of the group-sponsored trust are included in the group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts holdings of shares in the company are debited direct to equity.
Earnings per share The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share calculations follow the provisions of IAS 33 Earnings per share.
The diluted earnings per share figure is calculated by adjusting for the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share options, SAYE options and the Capital Appreciation Plan options granted by the company, but excluding the ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees Share Ownership Trust.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by the directors, either individually or if of a similar type in aggregate, as being either material or significant and which require disclosure in order to provide a view of the groups results excluding these items.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 59 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The group prepares its group financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the application of which often requires judgements to be made by management when formulating the groups financial position and results.
Under IFRS, the directors are required to adopt those accounting policies most appropriate to the groups circumstances for the purpose of presenting fairly the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the reported results or net asset position of the group should it later be determined that a different choice would have been more appropriate.
Management considers the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed below to be its key judgemental areas and, accordingly, provides an explanation of each below.
Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the groups audit committee.
The discussion below should also be read in conjunction with the groups disclosure of IFRS accounting policies, which is provided in note 1.
Acquisitions The groups accounting policy is that on acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated over the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill.
Fair value Determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired requires managements judgement and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, recoverability of assets, and unprovided liabilities and commitments particularly in relation to tax and VAT.
Intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
The measurement of the fair value of intangible assets acquired requires significant management judgement particularly in relation to the expected future cash flows from the acquired marketing databases which are generally based on managements estimate of marketing response rates, trademarks, brands, repeat and well established events.
At September 30 2009 the net book value of intangible assets was 134.0 million 2008: 135.1 million.
Goodwill Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Goodwill is impaired where the carrying value of goodwill is higher than the net present value of future cash flows of those cash generating units to which it relates.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the net present value are the forecast cash flows, the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
During the year the group recognised a goodwill impairment of 21.9 million 2008: 3.0 million note 5 and a reduction in goodwill arising from a deferred tax adjustment of nil 2008: 2.8 million note 5.
Goodwill held on the balance sheet at September 30 2009 was 291.3 million 2008: 272.1 million.
Acquisition option commitments The group is party to a number of put and call options over the remaining minority interests in some of its subsidiaries.
IAS 39 requires the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments to be recognised as a liability on the balance sheet with a corresponding decrease in reserves.
The discounts are unwound as a notional interest charge to the income statement.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the discounted present value of the options are the expected future cash flows and earnings of the business, the period remaining until the option is exercised and the discount rate.
At September 30 2009 the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments was 11.9 million 2008: 29.8 million.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
These assumptions are set out in note 23.
Management regularly perform a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest, which is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
The charge for share-based payments for the year ended September 30 2009 is 2.7 million 2008: 5.4 million.
Defined benefit pension scheme The surplus or deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme that is recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.
The calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, the long-term expected return on the schemes assets and member longevity.
Details of the assumptions used are shown in note 27.
Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against similar pension schemes.
60 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts continued Taxation The groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The group is a multi-national group with tax affairs in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to a higher than usual complexity to the groups tax structure and makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the group and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legislative processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The group has certain significant open items in several tax jurisdictions and as a result the amounts recognised in the group financial statements in respect of these items are derived from the groups best estimation and judgement, as described above.
However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means eventual resolution could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore affect the groups results and cash flows.
Recognition of deferred tax assets The recognition of net deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Historical differences between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
At September 30 2009, the group had a deferred tax asset of 18.5 million 2008: 16.5 million.
Treasury Interest rate exposure Interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
The maturity profile of these derivatives is matched with the expected future debt profile of the group.
The groups policy is to fix the interest rates on approximately 80% of its term debt looking forward over five years.
The expected future debt profile of the group is based on estimates of both timings and size of future, as yet unknown, acquisitions offset by an estimate of the cash generated by the group over a five year period.
If management materially underestimate the groups future debt profile this would lead to too few interest rate instruments being in place and the group more exposed to swings in interest rates.
An overestimate of the groups future debt profile would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess interest rate instruments.
At September 30 2009, the fair value of the groups interest rate swaps was a liability of 7.6 million 2008: 2.9 million.
Forward contracts The group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transactions in foreign currencies entered into by group companies and by the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling for reporting purposes.
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries, consequently, fluctuations in the value of pounds sterling versus currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their values have not changed in their original currency.
The group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Approximately two-thirds of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations.
However, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward partially to hedge its dollar revenues into sterling.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 18 month period.
If management materially underestimated the groups future US dollar revenues this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the group being more exposed to swings in US dollar to sterling exchange rates.
An overestimate of the groups US dollar revenue would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts.
At September 30 2009, the fair value of the groups forward contracts was a liability of 15.8 million 2008: 10.9 million and the foreign exchange loss on restructured hedging arrangements from unwinding excess forward contracts was 7.9 million 2008: nil note 7.
Details of the financial instruments used are set out in note 18 to the accounts.

A credit of 19,854,000 2008: 11,966,000 relating to tax on foreign exchange losses has been treated as exceptional as it is hedged by 19,854,000 2008: 11,966,000 of foreign exchange losses on tax equalisation contracts included within net finance costs note 7.
The group presents the above underlying effective tax rate to help users of this report better understand its tax charge.
In arriving at this rate, the group removes the tax effect of items which are adjusted for in arriving at the underlying profit disclosed in the appendix to the Chairmans Statement.
However, the current tax effect of goodwill and intangible items is not removed.
The group considers that the resulting underlying effective tax rate is more representative of its tax payable position, as the deferred tax effect of the goodwill and intangible items is not expected to crystallise.

During the year the goodwill in respect of each of the above businesses was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
The methodology applied to the value in use calculations, reflecting past experience and external sources of information, included: y Forecasts by business based on pre-tax cash flows derived from approved budgets for 2010.
Management believe these budgets to be reasonably achievable: y Subsequent cash flows for between one and three additional years increased in line with growth expectations of the applicable business: y The pre-tax discount rate of 10.5%, reflecting the companies weighted average cost of capital: and y Long-term growth rate of 3%.
Impairment Due to current market conditions an impairment of capitalised goodwill of 21,929,000 2008: 2,952,000 was recognised in the year.
This is limited mainly to the US-based activities in the structured finance sector where its main customers are experiencing a fall in demand and its Asia-based conference organiser and training business which has suffered a decline in its customers spend on training.
Both these businesses are part of the conferences and seminars business division.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 71 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 11 Goodwill and other intangibles continued Sensitivities Certain businesses, after the annual impairment review required under IAS 36, had a limited value in use in excess of carrying value of 1.8 million.
For these businesses management has set out below the change in assumptions required, in isolation, in order for the estimated carrying value to be equal or less than the value in use.
The change in assumptions are summarised as follows: y Increase in the WACC by 1% point.
y Decrease in the long-term growth rate by 1%.
The result of the change in assumptions of a 1% decrease in growth rates would result in an additional impairment of 1.1 million.
A 1% increase in WACC would result in an additional impairment of 1.9 million.
Management believes the general market conditions seem to have stabilised and therefore a decrease in growth rates to 2% or a WACC of 11.5% would be severe.
Management will continue to conduct regular reviews to monitor this matter.

Due to this, management believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
As of September 30 2009, trade receivables of 12,415,000 2008: 17,625,000 were past due for which the group has not provided as there has been no significant change in their credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The average age of these receivables is 59 days 2008: 71 days.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The ageing of these trade receivables is as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s Past due less than a month 8,618 9,276 Past due more than a month but less than two months 2,510 3,487 Past due more than two months but less than three months 703 2,780 Past due more than three months 584 2,082 12,415 17,625 As at September 30 2009, trade receivables of 11,524,000 2008: 9,174,000 were impaired and partially provided for.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s Past due less than a month 1,119 346 Past due more than a month but less than two months 2,644 541 Past due more than two months but less than three months 2,005 663 Past due more than three months 5,756 7,624 11,524 9,174 Movements on the group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s At October 1 6,593 4,287 Impairment losses recognised 4,684 3,662 Impairment losses reversed 1,295 758 Amounts written off as uncollectible 1,967 783 Exchange differences 174 185 At September 30 8,189 6,593 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts does not include individually impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation as these trade receivables are written off directly to the income statement.

In summary, the groups tax and treasury committee normally meets twice a year and is responsible for recommending policy to the board.
The groups treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that the group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions.
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates within policies and procedures approved by the board.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
Further details are set out in the interest rate risk section on page 80.
Forward contracts are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements.
Further details are set out in the foreign exchange rate risk section on page 79.
Capital risk management The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2008.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 22 and 24 respectively.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 77 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Net debt to EBITDA ratio The groups tax and treasury committee reviews the capital structure at least twice a year.
As part of the debt covenants under the loan facility provided by Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT, the board has to ensure that net debt to EBITDA does not exceed 4 times on a rolling 12 month basis.
The group expects to remain within these limits.
The net debt to EBITDA covenant is defined to allow the rate used in the translation of US dollar EBITDA, including hedging contracts, to be used also in the calculation of net debt, thereby removing any distortion to the covenant from increases in net debt due to short-term movements in the US dollar.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio at September 30 is as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s Committed loan facility 165,151 184,594 Loan notes 5,719 7,579 Total debt 170,870 192,173 Cash and cash equivalents 12,063 20,179 Net debt 158,807 171,994 EBITDA 79,769 79,221 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.99 2.17 EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation underlying operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of licences and software.
Categories of financial instruments The groups financial assets and liabilities at September 30 are as follows: 2009 2008 000s 000s Financial assets Derivative instruments fair value through profit and loss 138 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 1,138 1,681 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents 65,569 239,743 66,707 241,562 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments fair value through profit and loss 4,510 9,410 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 19,999 15,528 Acquisition option commitments 11,943 29,848 Loans and payables including overdrafts 283,791 429,612 320,243 484,398 Market price risk Market price risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, currency options and forward exchange contracts are set out in this note and represent the value for which an asset could be sold or liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at September 30 2009.
The group has no other material market price risks.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
There has been no change to the groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year.
78 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 18 Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange rate risk The groups principal foreign exchange exposure is to US dollar.
The group generates approximately two-thirds of its revenues in US dollars, including approximately 30% of the revenues in its UK-based businesses, and approximately 60% of its operating profits are US dollar-denominated.
The group is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the US dollar revenues in its UK businesses, and on the translation of the results of its US dollardenominated businesses.
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries.
Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially affect the translation of these results in the consolidated financial statements.
The group endeavours to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries with the related foreign currency interest cost arising from these borrowings providing a partial hedge against the translation of foreign currency profits.
The carrying amounts of the groups US dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2009 2008 2009 2008 000s 000s 000s 000s US dollar 238,928 319,647 499,659 412,386 Approximately two-thirds of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
However, at a group level, a series of US$ forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars.
In 2008, the group hedged fully for the coming 12 months and partially for a further 36 months.
This year, the directors reviewed the groups hedging policy and as a result reduced the period of partial hedging from up to 48 months to between 12 and 18 months and reduced the percentage of revenues hedged in the first 12 months to 80%.
The transition to the revised policy will take a number of months, with forward deals in excess of 18 months being allowed to naturally unwind.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 18 month period and is regularly reviewed and revised with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out or existing contracts maturity dates being moved forward or back.
The group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues are mainly in US dollars.
At a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the operations Canadian cost base.
In addition, each subsidiary is encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency where possible.
Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity.
The following table details the groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US dollar.
A 10% sensitivity has been determined by the board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
Where sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency a positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity.
For a 10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling against US dollar 2009 2008 000s 000s Change in profit for the year in income statement 106 1,652 Change in equity 897 606 The change in the loss to a profit from the sensitivity analysis is due to a change in the net working capital balance moving from a net asset to a net liability.
The increase in the profit in equity from the sensitivity analysis is due to the decrease of the value of net investment value in US dollar companies and the increase in the value of the derivative financial liabilities.
Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts.
This year, the directors reviewed the groups hedging policy and as a result reduced the period of hedging from up to 48 months to 18 months and reduced the percentage of revenues hedged in the first 12 months to 80%.
In 2008 the group designated certain forward contracts as a hedge of its net investment in US subsidiaries which had US dollar as their functional currency.
In 2008 this represents outstanding foreign currency to buy JPY and GBP.
As at September 30 2009, the aggregate amount of unrealised losses under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future revenue transactions is 11,273,000 2008: 10,078,000.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 36 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released in the income statement.
As at September 30 2009, the aggregate amount of unrealised losses under ineffective cash flow hedges still in place at the year end is 4,510,000 2008: nil, which have been recognised in the income statement.
Interest rate risks The groups borrowings are in both sterling and US dollars with the related interest tied to US and UK LIBOR.
This results in the groups interest charge being at risk to fluctuations in interest rates.
It is the groups policy to hedge approximately 80% of its interest exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps.
The maturity dates are spread in order to avoid interest rate basis risk and also to negate short-term changes in interest rates.
The predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates and this hedging strategy has the effect of spreading the groups exposure to fluctuations arising from changes in interest rates and hence protects the groups interest charge against sudden increases in rates but also prevents the group from benefiting immediately from falls in rates.
The groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on page 82.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents directors assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at the reporting date.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups: y Profit for the year ended September 30 2009 would decrease or increase by 199,000 2008: 420,000.
This is mainly attributable to the groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings: and y Other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 2,501,000 2008: 3,617,000 mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
The groups sensitivity to interest rates has not materially changed during the period due to the group benefiting from similar levels of fixed rates.
80 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 18 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the discount curves at reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges US dollar: Receive floating pay fixed Average contracted Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Less than 1 year 4.28 4.08 40,640 30,856 1,276 182 1 to 2 years 3.64 4.81 31,262 30,856 1,448 866 2 to 5 years 4.21 4.77 40,640 47,686 2,812 1,745 GBP: Receive floating pay fixed Average contracted Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Less than 1 year 5.73 5.61 15,000 14,000 385 100 1 to 2 years 5.68 5.73 12,000 15,000 779 23 2 to 5 years 5.53 5.61 10,000 22,000 888 240 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is LIBOR.
The group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact the income statement.
As at September 30 2009, the aggregate amount of unrealised interest under swap contracts deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future interest payable is 7,580,000 2008: 2,683,000.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 36 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the income statement.
As at September 30 2009, the aggregate amount of unrealised interest under ineffective swaps still in place at the year end is 8,000 2008: 227,000 which has been recognised in the income statement.
Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
The group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding, with and the credit quality of, these counterparties.
For the groups cash and cash equivalents these are principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and for derivative financial instruments with DMGT who have treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA.
The group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the groups large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk of non-payment taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the balance sheet.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 81 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The group has significant intercompany borrowings and is an approved borrower under a DMGT, $400 million dedicated multi-currency borrowing facility.
The facility is divided into four quantums of sterling and US dollar funds with three and five year terms with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $310 million 194 million and 59 million.
Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate of between 1.3% and 3.0% above LIBOR dependent on the ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
The facilitys covenant requires the groups net debt to be no more than four times adjusted EBITDA on a rolling 12 month basis.
Failure to do so would result in the group being in breach of the facility potentially resulting in the facility being withdrawn or impediment of management decision making by the lender.
Management regularly monitor the covenant and prepare detailed debt forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach.
The groups strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its debt.
The group has a cash conversion rate the percentage by which cash generated by operations covers operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation, share option expense and exceptional items of 91% 2008: 123%, due to much of its subscription, conference and training revenue being paid in advance.
The three year quantums of the facility are due for renewal in December 2011 and the five year quantums in December 2013.
Under the DMGT facility, at September 30 2009, the group has 81.4 million of undrawn but committed facilities available to draw upon if required.
This is more than sufficient for the group to meet expected and unexpected short-term working capital requirements.
However, given the level of uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, there is a risk that the undrawn portion of the facility may be unavailable or withdrawn if DMGT experience funding difficulties themselves.
It is, however, unlikely that this would impact the group as DMGT have a wide range of funding sources, other than bank debt, available to them.
In addition, if DMGT were unable to fulfil its commitment to the group the directors are confident that the group is in a position that would enable it to secure adequate facilities outside of DMGT, albeit at an increased cost to the business due to high interest charges imposed given the crisis in the credit markets.
The following table details the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, mainly variable borrowings.
This table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the financial liabilities including both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that the interest rates are floating, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at September 30 2009.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the group may be required to settle.

The facility was renewed in December 2008 on terms broadly similar to those of the previous facility.
The previous facility was due to expire in August 2009 and hence classified in September 2008 as a current liability.
On renewal the directors took the opportunity to reduce the size of the facility from 300 million to $400 million.
The new facility is divided into four quantums of sterling and US dollar funds with three and five year terms with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $310 million 194 million and 59 million.
Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate of between 1.25% and 3.0% above LIBOR dependant on the ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
At September 30 2009, the groups net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.99 times and the uncommitted undrawn facility available to the group was 81,419,000 2008: 115,406,000.

At September 30 2009 a deferred tax asset of 4,515,000 2008: 3,728,000 has been recognised.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose.
The US losses have expiry dates between 2010 and 2029.
At the balance sheet date, the group has unused UK tax losses available for offset against future profits.
At September 30 2009 a deferred tax asset of 1,165,000 2008: nil has been recognised.
UK losses have no expiry dates.
At the balance sheet date, a net deferred tax asset of 12,794,000 2008: 12,731,000 has been recognised in respect of US tax deductible goodwill amortisation, capitalised intangible assets and other short-term timing differences.
The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, it is probable that the level of profits in the future years are sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 24,363,000 2008: 121,912,000 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at September 30 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after July 1 2009.
The temporary differences at September 30 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

Options granted relate to those that are likely to be issued under the third and final tranche of the CAP 2004 which vest on February 12 2010, three months following the announcement of the companys results.
The number of options granted is provisional and will primarily require a true-up to reflect adjustments of the individual businesses profits during the period to December 31 2009 as required by the Remuneration Committee.
As such the actual number of options vested could vary from that disclosed.

86 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 23 Share-based payments continued Capital Appreciation Plan 2004 CAP 2004 The CAP 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005.
Each of the CAP awards comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The initial performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards.
One third of the awards vested immediately.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009.
The primary performance target was also achieved this year and 1,521,498 options for the third final tranche of options in 2009 will vest in February 2010, the maximum number of options potentially vesting adjusted for the businesses not achieving the additional performance criteria page 37.
For those individual participants businesses where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranche have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
Share Option Schemes The group has 11 share option schemes for which an IFRS2 Share based payments charge has been recognised.
Details of these schemes are set out in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 36 and 37.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are shown below: The executive and Save as You Earn Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over a period of 12 years.
The executive options fair values have been discounted at a rate of 10% to reflect their performance conditions.
The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The credit recognised in the year in respect of these options was 142,000 2008: expense 281,000.

Under both plans, contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
However, Euromoney PensionSaver is a group personal pension arrangement rather than the trust-based arrangement used by the Euromoney Pension Plan.
Under both schemes, employees are able to contribute a minimum of 3% of salary with an equal company contribution in the first three years of employment and thereafter at twice the employee contribution rate, up to a maximum employer contribution of 10% of salary.
The Euromoney Pension Plan is a part of the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK trust-based defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits previously held under this trust have been transferred to a new trust-based arrangement specifically for life assurance purposes.
The process of transferring out the remaining assets of the Euromoney Pension Plan is now in its final stages following which the Plan will be wound up.
Assets of both plans are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of both plans is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The scheme is closed to new members.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension and its assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.

Harmsworth Pension Scheme The Harmsworth Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a trustee company.
The scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
The contributions payable to the scheme are determined by the trustee company after taking advice from an independent qualified actuary, and following agreement with the company.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at March 31 2007 using the projected unit credit method.
On September 14 2009 DMGT announced a number of changes affecting the Harmsworth Pension Scheme that are designed to help secure the financial health of this scheme into the future and to control the cost of its operation.
DMGT decided that the scheme would remain open for future accrual of pension benefits for current employees.
However, from October 1 2009 new employees will no longer be offered the option to transfer from PensionSaver plans to the Harmsworth Pension Scheme after five years service.
Existing members of the scheme will continue to be able to earn additional pension benefits in the scheme but their pay increases counting towards pension will be limited to those at or below the prevailing rate of inflation, with inflation capped at 5%.
In addition, the company plans to introduce a series of measures principally designed to limit the companys exposure to people living longer than is expected.
The measures will be discussed with scheme trustees and a formal process of employee consultation will begin as soon as the proposals have been finalised.
The funding strategy agreed with the Trustee of the principal scheme made allowance for assumed future investment returns on the schemes assets of 3.3% p. a. above price inflation, compared with the real return of some 2.6% p. a. implicit within the calculation of the Technical Provisions i. e. the value of the schemes benefit liabilities.
DMGT agreed with the Trustee that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and DMGT has put in place a letter of credit to be updated annually of an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment return arising prior to the next triennial valuation.
As at October 4 2009, the letter of credit had a value of 32.1 million 2008: 21.8 million.
Cash contributions paid by the Company to the Harmsworth Pension Scheme as required by the schedule of contributions remain at the same level of 18.0% of members scheme salaries 2008: 18.0% with employees contributing either 5% or 7.5% depending on which section of the scheme they are in.
However, since January 1 2009 a majority of members have agreed to a salary sacrifice arrangement whereby the company pays the equivalent of the employees contribution in exchange for a corresponding reduction in salary.
In addition, DMGT agreed to make a series of funding payments amounting to 3.2 million over a period of 27 months commencing in September 2009 in exchange for which the Trustees agreed to accept the cancellation of letters of credit that had been provided by DMGT following the merger of the two main pension schemes of the DMGT group in November 2007.
The first payment of 1.0 million under this agreement was made on September 29 2009.
Other key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: 2009 2008 Long-term assumed rate of: Price inflation 3.0% p. a.
Pension increases on excess over guaranteed minimum pension 3.0% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities Pre-retirement 6.4% p. a.
The financial assumptions shown above used in the most recent actuarial valuation were selected to provide a basis for funding the schemes and are not intended to reflect the companys experience or policy regarding pay in any one financial year.
The valuation of the scheme showed that the combined accumulated assets of the scheme as at March 31 2007 represented 99% of the schemes Technical Provisions in respect of past service benefits.
However, in common with the majority of defined benefit schemes, there was a sharp deterioration over the following twelve months, with the equivalent funding level falling to 84% as at March 31 2008.
Members are able to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
No benefit obligation arises to the DMGT, or the company, from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been excluded from the valuation of assets and liabilities reported below.
The groups pension charge for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme for the year ended September 30 2009 was 207,000 2008: 203,000.
The group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
90 Euromoney In stitutional Investor PLC 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued The ultimate parent company, DMGT, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of DMGT have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2007, and adjusted to October 4 2009 by the actuary.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1,228.4 million 2008: 1,322.5 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 78% 2008: 99% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Defined benefit scheme The company operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme closed to new members, a defined benefit scheme.
Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme The Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme MBPS is a defined benefit scheme providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances, being invested with the Norwich Union Life Insurance Society, Schroder Investment Management Ltd, and certain other specific investments managed directly by the Trustees.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the group.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at June 1 2007.
The company cash contribution rate to the scheme during the year was 22.8% 2008: 22.8% of pensionable salaries.
This MBPS is closed to new members.
The figures in this note are based on calculations carried out in connection with the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at June 1 2007 and adjusted to September 30 2009 by the actuary.
The key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: 2009 2008 Long-term assumed rate of: Pensionable salary growth 4.4% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pre January 1997 members 5.0% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pensions earned from May 30 2002 to June 30 2006 post January 1997 members 3.1% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pensions earned from June 30 2006 post January 1997 members 2.5% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities 5.6% p. a.
Pension increase in deferment 3.1% p. a.
The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
The fair value of the assets held by the MBPS and the long-term expected rate of return on each class of assets are shown in the following table: With profits Equities Bonds policy Cash Total 2009 Value at September 30 2009 000 5,474 11,616 2,091 2,371 21,552 % of assets held 25.4% 53.9% 9.7% 11.0% 100.0% Long-term rate of return expected at September 30 2009 8.00% 5.50% 5.75% 3.50% With profits Equities Bonds policy Cash Total 2008 Value at September 30 2008 000 4,449 7,512 2,400 5,151 19,512 % of assets held 22.8% 38.5% 12.3% 26.4% 100.0% Long-term rate of return expected at September 30 2008 8.70% 5.00% 5.75% 5.00% A reconciliation of the net pension surplus reported in the balance sheet is shown in the following table: 2009 2008 000s 000s Present value of defined benefit obligation 21,916 16,985 Assets at fair value 21,552 19,512 Deficit surplus reported in the balance sheet 364 2,527 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 91 COMPANY ACCOUNTS OUR GOVERNANCE OUR PERFORMANCE GROUP ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme continued The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a company can recognise a pension surplus on its balance sheet.
In 2008, having taken account of the rules of the scheme, the fact that the scheme remains open to new accrual, and the levels of service cost and cash contributions, the company considered that recognition of the schemes surplus on its balance sheet at September 30 2008 was in accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14.
