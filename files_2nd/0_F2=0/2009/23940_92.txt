These expenses will only be utilised if the Company generates sufficient taxable profits in the future or if there is a change in the legislation and capital gains become taxable for investment trust companies.
It is considered too uncertain that either of these will occur and, therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
There is no capital gains tax payable by the Company because investment trust companies are exempt from this tax.
