Operating leases The presentation of operating lease expense and future minimum lease payments has been revised in 2009 in order to provide more meaningful information about the costs incurred by BP under these arrangements, and the associated future commitments.
The comparative information has been amended to conform to the revised presentation.
In the case of an operating lease entered into by BP as the operator of a jointly controlled asset, the amounts shown in the tables below represent the net operating lease expense and net future minimum lease payments.
These net amounts are after deducting amounts reimbursed, or to be reimbursed, by joint venture partners, whether the joint venture partners have co-signed the lease or not.
Where BP is not the operator of a jointly controlled asset, BPs share of the lease expense and future minimum lease payments is included in the amounts shown, whether BP has co-signed the lease or not.
The table below shows the expense for the year in respect of operating leases.
$ million 2009 2008 2007 Minimum lease payments 4,109 4,114 3,522 Contingent rentals 9 97 80 Sub-lease rentals 133 194 183 3,967 4,017 3,419 The future minimum lease payments at 31 December, before deducting related rental income from operating sub-leases of $379 million 2008 $547 million, are shown in the table below.
This does not include future contingent rentals.
Where the lease rentals are dependent on a variable factor, the future minimum lease payments are based on the factor as at inception of the lease.
