Report & Accounts 2009 Statement of Investment Objective and Policy Alliance Trust is a self-managed investment company with investment trust status.
Our objective is to be a core investment for investors seeking increasing value over the long term.
We have no fixed asset allocation benchmark and we invest in a wide range of asset classes throughout the world to achieve our objective.
Our focus is to generate a real return for shareholders over the medium to long term by a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend.
We pursue our objective by: Investing in both quoted and unquoted equities across the globe in different sectors and industries: Investing internationally in fixed income securities: Investing in other asset classes and financial instruments, either directly or through investment vehicles: and Investing in subsidiaries and associated businesses which allow us to expand into other related activities.
We are prepared to invest any proportion of the total corporate capital in any of the above asset classes, subject only to the restrictions imposed on us by the regulatory or fiscal regime within which we operate.
However, we would expect equities to comprise at least 50% of our portfolio.
Changes to the asset allocation will be dependent upon attractive investment opportunities being available.
Where market conditions permit, we will use gearing of not more than 30% of our net assets at any given time.
We can use derivative instruments to hedge, enhance and protect positions, including currency exposures.
