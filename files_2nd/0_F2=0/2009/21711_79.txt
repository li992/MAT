The reserve created was thereafter available as distributable profits to be used for all purposes permitted by the 1994 Law, including the buy back of Shares and the payment of dividends.
On 1 July 2008 The Companies Guernsey Law, 1994 as amended was replaced by The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 as amended the 2008 Law.
The 2008 Law does not require share premium to be held in a separate account and any premium at which Shares are issued can be used for all purposes, including the buy back of Shares and the payment of dividends, provided that the Company would after any distribution still meet the statutory Solvency Test as such is defined in the 2008 Law.
Accordingly, upon the issue of C Shares in August 2008 and December 2009 the entire amount of share premium received on the issue of such C Shares was immediately transferred to distributable reserves.
