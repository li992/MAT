Notes to the Company Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate accounts of the parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The accounts have been prepared under the historic cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments detailed below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The retained loss of the Company for the year is 85.9m 2008: 59.0m.
Leases Leases of tangible fixed assets where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Company are classified as finance leases and the assets are capitalised in the balance sheet as plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases of assets where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or to the first review if shorter.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 3 to 5 years The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
Available for sale investments Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified as a loan or receivable, held to maturity or at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
124 National Express Group PLC 1 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
Pensions The Company participates in both the National Express Group multi-employer funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme under the requirements of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits.
Share-based payment In accordance with the transition provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payment to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
Non-market-based performance-related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead those non-market conditions are taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and at each balance sheet date before vesting.
The cumulative expense is calculated based on that estimate.
Market-based performance conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value and at each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated irrespective of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the profit and loss account.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, including the foreign currency contracts, gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 29 for parent company accounts.
The disclosures are included within the consolidated accounts.

For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise prices.
The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted Number average Number average 2 of share exercise price of share exercise price 2 options p options p Options without a nil exercise price: At 1 January 35,299 381 62,931 385 Granted during the year 10,671 479 Lapsed during the year 4,540 420 Group transfers during the year 2,500 863 Exercised during the year 35,803 793 1 Outstanding at 31 December 30,759 376 35,299 381 Exercisable at 31 December 22,480 338 24,628 339 Options with a nil exercise price: At 1 January 812,210 nil 879,121 nil Granted during the year 1,495,767 nil 452,375 nil Lapsed during the year 280,186 nil 284,469 nil Group transfers during the year nil 10,733 nil Exercised during the year 130,533 nil 224,084 nil Outstanding at 31 December 1,897,258 nil 812,210 nil Exercisable at 31 December Total outstanding at 31 December 1,928,017 847,509 Total exercisable at 31 December 22,480 24,628 1 Included within this balance are options over 5,774 2008: 5,774 shares for which no expense has been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, as the options were granted before 7 November 2002.
Although there has been subsequent modification to the options, no FRS 20 charge has been recognised as the amounts are not material.
2 Movement in allocations prior to 11 November 2009 and the corresponding weighted average exercise price have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the Rights Issue.
Details of the Rights Issue are provided in note 32 of the consolidated accounts.
1 The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had exercise prices that were between 207p and 479p 2008 : between 207p and 479p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: 1 Exercise price p 2009 2008 0300 6,142 6,142 350650 24,617 29,157 30,759 35,299 1 The 2008 exercise prices have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the bonus element of the Rights Issue.
The options have a weighted average contractual life of one year 2008: two years.
Options were exercised throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 341p 2008: 863p.
132 National Express Group PLC 17 Share-based payment continued The weighted average fair value of the remaining share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without nil exercise price Share options with nil exercise price 2009 2008 2009 2008 Risk free interest rate 2.8% 4.2%4.9% 2.0% Expected volatility 32.5% 26.8%27.2% 48.4% 25.1%32.0% Peer group volatility 49.9% 30.8% Expected option life in years 6 years 36 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 12.6% 3.4%4.0% 2.7% 3.8%7.2% Weighted average share price at grant date 248p 884p1135p 175p405p 547p972p Weighted average share price adjusted for Rights Issue 129p 459p590p 91p210p 284p505p Weighted average exercise price at grant date 248p 922p1163p nil nil Weighted average exercise price adjusted for Rights Issue 129p 479604p nil nil Weighted average fair value of options at grant date 20p 140p211p 174p374p 166p868p Weighted average fair value of options granted adjusted for Rights Issue 10p 73p110p 91p194p 86p451p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2008: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last nine years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.
National Express Group PLC 133 Notes to the Company Accounts continued 18 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Company has entered into operating leases on certain properties.
Annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Land and buildings 2009 2008 m m Operating leases which expire: Within one year 0.2 Within two to five years 0.5 1.1 Contingent liabilities a Guarantees The Company has guaranteed credit facilities totalling 56.6m 2008: 129.5m of certain subsidiaries.

These proceedings relate to a period of time when Ray OToole was director of Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd, which was a subsidiary of the Group.
The Company is also a defendant to these proceedings.
The Directors believe no liabilities will arise from these proceedings and therefore no provision has been made at 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2008.
19 Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 3c of FRS 8, Related party disclosures from disclosing transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
20 Post balance sheet events On 7 January 2010, National Express Group PLC issued a 350.0m seven year Sterling bond with a coupon of 6.25% under the 1,000,000,000 ETM programme.
The proceeds from the issue were used to repay the remaining 270.0m outstanding on the 540.0m bridge facility, which was subsequently cancelled.
The remaining proceeds were used to repay other borrowings.
The bond was issued subject to the Group obtaining two investment grade credit ratings prior to 13 January 2011.
In the event that the Group does not obtain such ratings by this date, the coupon will step up by 1.25% thereafter.
