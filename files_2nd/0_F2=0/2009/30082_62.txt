11 Financial Instruments Risk management policies and procedures The Group invests in equities and other investments for the long term in pursuit of the Investment Objectives set out for each share class on pages 2 and 3.
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction or an increase in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: Market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk Liquidity risk Credit risk The Investment Managers policies and processes for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
TR Property Investment Trust 75 THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11.1 Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Manager runs diversified portfolios for each share class and reports to the Board on the portfolio activity and performance at each board meeting.
The Board monitors the investment activity and strategy to ensure it is compatible with the stated objectives for each share class.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its quoted equity investments and investment property portfolio, was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Investments held at fair value 343,905 697,750 Concentration of exposure to price risks As set out in the Investment Policies for each share class on pages 2 and 3, there are limitations on the amount of exposure to a single company, geographical region or direct property.
These limitations ensure an appropriate spread of exposure to individual or sector price risks.
As an investment company dedicated to investment in the property sector, the Group is exposed to price movements across the property asset class as a whole.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity and direct property investments.
This level of change is consistent with the example shown in the previous year.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and direct property exposure at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The Board receives a report at each board meeting on the proportion of the investment portfolio held in Sterling, Euros or other currencies.
The Group sometimes hedges foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into Sterling upon receipt.
Cash deposits are held in Sterling and or Euro denominated accounts.

It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling Euro - 15% 2008: 15% Sterling Swedish Krona - 15% 2008: 15% These percentages are consistent with those used in the preceding financial year.
If Sterling had strengthened against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 Swedish Swedish Euro Krona Other Euro Krona Other '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 1,074 187 2 1,009 109 20 Capital return 30,737 1,782 558 37,141 4,901 1,298 Change to the profit after tax for the year 31,811 1,969 556 38,150 5,010 1,318 Change to the shareholders' funds 31,811 1,969 556 38,150 5,010 1,318 2009 2008 Change to total earnings: per Ordinary share 10.36 p 13.19 p per Sigma share 6.19 p 8.13 p If Sterling had weakened against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2009 2008 Swedish Swedish Euro Krona Other Euro Krona Other '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 1,461 253 3 1,332 147 27 Capital return 39,560 2,411 755 60,962 6,630 1,757 Change to the profit after tax for the year 41,021 2,664 752 62,294 6,777 1,784 Change to the shareholders funds 41,021 2,664 752 62,294 6,777 1,784 2009 2008 Change to total earnings: per Ordinary share 13.79p 19.44p per Sigma share 7.22p 14.94p 78 TR Property Investment Trust THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11.3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of any investments in fixed interest securities the fair value of the debenture loans the level of income receivable from cash at bank and on deposit the level of interest expense on any variable rate bank loans the prices of the underlying securities held in the portfolios Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
Property companies usually have borrowings themselves and the level of gearing and structure of its debt portfolio is a key factor when assessing the investment in a property company.
The Group has fixed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rate on the debenture loan is fixed, details are set out in note 14.
In addition to the debentures the Group has an unsecured, multi-currency revolving loan facility which carries a variable rate of interest based on the currency drawn, plus a margin.
The Manager considers both the level of debt on the balance sheet of the Group i. e. the debenture and any bank loans drawn and the see-through gearing, taking into account the assets and liabilities of the underlying investments, when considering the investment portfolio.
These gearing levels are reported regularly to the Board.
The majority of the Companys investment portfolio is non-interest bearing.
As a result the Companys financial assets are not directly subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
At the year end the Group was holding significant cash balances: part of these cash balances were held to offset the long term borrowings it has in place.
Interest rate risk exposure The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 77,568,000 2008: 51,881,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is 1,489,000 2008: Nil.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 15,000,000 2008: 39,994,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2008: same Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facility is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type of loan The finance charge on the debenture stocks was at a weighted average interest rate of 9.891% 2008: 9.625%.
The year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates changes.
Interest rate sensitivity A change of 2% on interest rates at the reporting date would have had the following direct impact: 2009 2009 2008 2008 2% 2% 2% 2% Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 000 000 000 000 Change to shareholders funds 1,551 1,551 1,038 1,038 Change to total earnings loss : per Ordinary share 0.48p 0.48 p 0.29p 0.29 p per Sigma share 0.25p 0.25 p 0.23p 0.23 p This level of change is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes throughout the period.
This assessment does not take into account the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of the investments the Group holds.
