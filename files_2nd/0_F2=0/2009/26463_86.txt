GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37.
SHARE SCHEMES The London Stock Exchange Group Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, approved at the 2004 AGM, has two elements, a conditional award of Performance Shares and an award of Matching Shares linked to investment by the executive of annual bonus in the Companys shares.
Vesting of these awards is dependent upon the Companys total shareholder return performance and also for awards made since 2008 adjusted basic earnings per share.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 48.
Under the Groups previous share option plan approved by shareholders in 2002, the maximum value of shares placed under option to an individual was equivalent to 100 per cent of their annual salary.
No further awards will be made under this scheme.
Prior to 2002, under the previous long-term incentive scheme comprising the Initial and Annual Share Plans option grants and share awards were made based on approvals prior to the Groups listing in July 2001.
No further option grants or share awards will be made under this scheme apart from the SAYE scheme available to all staff.
Under both the Initial and Annual Share Plan, share awards have a vesting period of three years and share options become exercisable at 20 per cent per annum over five years with a contractual life of 10 years.
The SAYE scheme and International Sharesave Plan provide for grants of options to employees who enter into a SAYE savings contract and options were granted at 20 per cent below fair market value.
Share awards were granted at nil cost to employees and share options were granted at fair market value or above.
Under terms agreed at the time of the merger, Massimo Capuano and a small number of senior executives in Italy were eligible to participate in a share bonus plan for the year ended 31 March 2009.
He received an award of ordinary shares with a value equal to 100 per cent of his full-year equivalent annual bonus, subject to a maximum award of 150 per cent of base salary.
A performance-related Restricted Share Plan was introduced in 2008.
Under this plan if the Company meets or exceeds its stretching financial targets for the financial year, deferred shares will be awarded to a limited number of employees who have contributed to this success.
These shares will then be released to individuals 12 months after grant contingent on continued employment.
Any recipient of an LTIP award in 2008, including executive directors and other senior executives, will not participate in the Restricted Share Plan.
The Group established an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire the shares to meet commitments to Group employees.
At the year end 3,621,781 2008: 2,178,665 shares were held by the trust, funded by an interest free loan from the Group.
The Company has no employees, but in accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities has the obligation for the assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP trust and these have been consolidated in the Groups financial statements.
The cost of the Groups shares held by the trust are deducted from retained earnings.
