The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004 and expanded by the Additional Guidance on European Embedded Values Disclosures issued in October 2005.
Life insurance products are, by their nature, long-term and the profit on this business is generated over a significant number of years.
Accounting under IFRS alone does not, in Prudentials opinion, fully reflect the value of future profit streams.
Prudential considers that embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profit streams of the Groups long-term businesses and is a valuable supplement to statutory accounts.
Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns Consistent with previous reporting practice, the Group provides supplementary analysis of the IFRS profit before tax attributable to shareholders analyses its EEV basis results so as to distinguish operating profit based on longer-term investments returns from other elements of total profit.
On both the IFRS and EEV bases, operating earnings per share are calculated using operating profits based on longer-term investment returns, after related tax and minority interests.
These profits exclude short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
Under the EEV basis, where additional profit and loss effects arise, operating profit based on longer term investment returns also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings and the effect of changes in economic assumptions and changes in the time value of cost of options and guarantees arising from changes in economic factors.
In 2009, as a result of the exceptional dislocated market conditions, the Group incurred non-recurrent cost of 235 million for hedging its Insurance Groups Directive IGD capital surplus.
These costs have been shown separately from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns as part of the short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
Also, in June 2009 the Group completed the previously announced sale of its Taiwan agency business.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the Groups businesses, the effect of disposal and the results of the Taiwan agency business are shown separately from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The presentation of the comparative results for 2008 has been adjusted accordingly as described in notes 18 and I1 of the EEV and IFRS financial statements, respectively.
After adjusting for related tax and minority interests, the amounts excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share.
