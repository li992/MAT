To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption set at 31 December 2007, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily Government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Over the course of 2007, the Plans investment strategy changed and a series of derivatives were implemented to remove risk within the portfolio.
The value of the derivative instruments was contained within the asset values at 31 December 2007 and reflected in the expected return for 2008.
