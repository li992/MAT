Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC 33 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 January 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation and going concern The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued in January 2009 and adopted early.
The early adoption of the January 2009 SORP had no effect on the financial statements of the Company, other than the requirement to separately disclose capital reserves that relate to the revaluation of investments held at the reporting date.
These are disclosed in note 14.
This new requirement replaces the previous requirement to disclose the value of the capital reserve that was unrealised.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe this is appropriate for the reasons outlined in the Directors Report on page 21.
The financial statements and the net asset value per share figures have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
b Revenue, expenses and interest payable Income from equity investments other than special dividends, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Special dividends are credited to revenue or capital according to the circumstances.
Foreign income is converted at the exchange rate applicable at the time of receipt.
Interest receivable on AAA rated money market funds and short term deposits and expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Income from underwriting commission is recognised as earned.
Interest payable is calculated on an effective yield basis.
Expenses are charged to capital when they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments.
In this respect, the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Boards expectation of returns from the Companys investments over the long-term in the form of revenue and capital respectively see note 3. c Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
SETS is the London Stock Exchange electronic trading service covering most of the market including all FTSE All-Share and the most liquid AIM constituents.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement.
d Dividends payable Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
e Capital reserves Gains or losses on disposal of investments and changes in fair values of investments are transferred to the capital reserve.
The capital element of the management fee and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is also credited to this reserve.
The ordinary share capital on the Balance Sheet relates to the number of shares in issue and in treasury.
Only when the shares are cancelled, either from treasury or directly, is a transfer be made to the capital redemption reserve.
f Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax 34 Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets being recognised only if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Temporary differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Owing to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
g Foreign currency The Company receives a small proportion of its investment income in foreign currency.
These amounts are translated at the rate ruling on the date of receipt.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the Balance Sheet date.
h Traded options The Company may enter into certain derivatives eg options to gain exposure to the market.
The option contracts are accounted for as separate derivative contracts and are therefore shown in other assets or other liabilities at their fair value ie market value adjusted for the amortisation of transaction expenses.
The premium received and fair value changes in the open position are recognised in the revenue column, losses realised on the exercise of the contracts are recorded in the capital column of the Income Statement.

At the year end there were four open positions, valued at 89,000 2008 nil.

The management fee is chargeable 40% 2008 30% to revenue and 60% 2008 70% to capital.
There were no commonly managed funds held in the portfolio during the year to 31 January 2009 2008 none.

2009 2008 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 5.
Taxation 000 000 Withholding tax on income from overseas 77 85 investments There is no liability to corporation tax for the year 2008 nil.
At the year end, the Company had accumulated surplus management expenses and loan relationship losses of 102,263,000 2008 99,304,000.
These have been generated because such a large part of the Companys income is derived from dividends from UK companies.
These losses are not recognised as a deferred tax asset because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that future period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.
36 Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC Due to the Companys status as an investment trust and the intention to continue to meet the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and futures and options for the purpose of managing currency and market risks arising from the Companys activities.
During the year, the Company entered into certain derivative contracts.
Positions closed during the year realised a capital loss of 169,000 2008 nil.
As disclosed in note 2, the premium received and fair value changes in respect of options written in the year was 336,000.
The largest position in derivative contracts held during the year at any given time was 103,000 2008 nil.
The Company had four open positions in derivative contracts at 31 January 2009 valued at 89,000 2008 nil.
Risk management The Manager has a dedicated investment management process, which ensures that the investment policy explained on page 7 is followed.
Stock selection procedures are in place based on active portfolio management and identification of stocks.
The portfolio is reviewed on a periodic basis by a Senior Investment Manager and also by the Managers Investment Committee.
Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The Manager has an independent Investment Risk department for reviewing the investment risk parameters of the Companys portfolio on a regular basis.
The department reports to the Managers Performance Review Committee which is chaired by the Managers Chief Investment Officer.
The departments responsibility is to review and monitor ex-ante predicted portfolio risk and style characteristics using best practice, industry standard multi-factor models.
During the past year these have highlighted both the highest market volatility on record and an increased correlation in equity share price movements.
Additionally, the Managers Compliance department continually monitors the Companys investment and borrowing powers and reports to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market risk comprising interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude shortterm debtors and creditors, other than for currency disclosures.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: and interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Interest risk profile The interest rate risk profile of the portfolio of financial assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 January 2009 Years % 000 000 Assets Sterling 5.95 5.13 2,725 5,199 Total assets 2,725 5,199 Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate Years % 000 000 Liabilities Bank loans 0.02 1.86 12,000 Debenture Stock 10.25 7.87 28,467 Total liabilities 40,467 42 Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 January 2008 Years % 000 000 Assets Sterling 5.50 3,004 Total assets 3,004 Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate Years % 000 000 Liabilities Bank loans 0.01 6.09 18,000 Debenture Stock 11.24 7.87 28,454 Total liabilities 46,454 The weighted average interest rate is based on the current yield of each asset, weighted by its market value.
The weighted average interest rate on bank loans is based on the interest rate payable, weighted by the total value of the loans.
The maturity dates of the Companys borrowings are shown in notes 11 and 12 to the financial statements.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The Companys equity portfolio and short-term debtors and creditors excluding bank loans have been excluded from the above tables.
All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Companys: profit before tax for the year ended 31 January 2009 would increase by 52,000 2008 increase by 30,000 and had interest rates been 100 basis points lower the converse would apply.
This is attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
the Company holds no financial instruments that will have an equity reserve impact.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the interest rate risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
Foreign currency risk A small proportion of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities whose values are subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
In addition, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates upon the profits of investee companies can result, indirectly, in changes in their valuations.
Consequently the Balance Sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates and it is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuations arising on dividends paid in foreign currencies, and, indirectly due to the impact of foreign exchange rates upon the profits of investee companies.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC 43 continued Notes to the Financial Statements Foreign currency risk exposure by currency of denomination: 31 January 2009 31 January 2008 Net Total Net Total monetary currency monetary currency Investments assets exposure Investments assets exposure 000 000 000 000 000 000 Euro 13,219 28 13,247 12,431 12,431 Sterling 259,510 30,946 228,564 413,147 39,044 374,103 Total 272,729 30,918 241,811 425,578 39,044 386,534 The asset allocation between specific markets can vary from time to time based on the Managers opinion of the attractiveness of the individual stocks in these markets.
Foreign currency sensitivity There is no sensitivity analysis included as the Board believes the amount exposed to foreign currency denominated monetary assets to be immaterial.
Where the Companys equity investments which are non-monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included within the other price risk sensitivity analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
Both the allocation of assets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 17, act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges in the UK and Europe.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 January 2009 would have increased by 27,273,000 2008 increase of 42,558,000 and equity reserves would have increased by the same amount.
Had market prices been 10% lower the converse would apply.
ii Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise Debenture Stock and a revolving facility.
The Debenture Stock provides secure longterm funding while short term flexibility is achieved through the borrowing facility.
It is the Boards policy to maintain a gearing level, measured on the most stringent basis of calculation after netting off cash equivalents, of less than 30% at all times.
Details of borrowings at the 31 January 2009 are shown in notes 11 and 12.
Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly cash and listed securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities, details of which can be found in note 11.
Under the terms of the loan facility, the Manager provides the lender with loan covenant reports on a monthly basis, to provide the lender with assurance that the terms of the facility are not being breached.
The Manager will also review the credit rating of a lender on a regular basis.
Details of the Boards policy on gearing are shown in the interest rate risk section of this note.
Liquidity risk exposure At 31 January 2009 and 31 January 2008 the amortised cost of the Companys Debenture Stock was 28,467,000 and 28,454,000 respectively.
This is due to be redeemed at par on 30 April 2019.
At 31 January 2009 and 31 January 2008 44 Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC the Companys bank loans, amounted to 12,000,000 and 18,000,000, respectively.
The facility is committed until 31 July 2009 and subsequent to 31 January 2009 the amount outstanding was reduced to 2,000,000. iii Credit risk This is failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The Company considers credit risk not to be significant as it is actively managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the review of failed trade reports on a monthly basis.
In addition, the custodian carries out a stock reconciliation to third party administrators records on a monthly basis to ensure discrepancies are picked up on a timely basis.
The Managers Compliance department carries out periodic reviews of the custodians operations and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
This review will also include checks on the maintenance and security of investments held: the risk of counterparty exposure due to stock lending as detailed in note 9 is mitigated by the review of collateral positions provided daily by the various counterparties involved: cash is held only with reputable banks whose credit ratings are monitored on a regular basis.
Other than the assets which have been loaned out under the Companys stock lending programme during the year see note 9, none of the Companys financial assets is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts in the Balance Sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 January was as follows: 2009 2008 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum Sheet exposure Sheet exposure 000 000 000 000 Current assets Fixed interest securities 2,725 2,725 Debtors and prepayments 5,227 5,227 5,404 5,404 Cash and short term deposits 5,199 5,199 3,004 3,004 13,151 13,151 8,408 8,408 None of the Companys financial assets is past due or impaired.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair value of borrowings has been calculated at 45,965,000 as at 31 January 2009 2008 51,759,000 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 40,600,000 2008 46,600,000 note 11.
The fair value of each loan is determined by aggregating the expected future cash flows for that loan discounted at a rate comprising the borrowers margin plus an average of market rates applicable to loans of a similar period of time and currency.
All other assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Contingent asset On 5 November 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that management fees on investment trusts should be exempt from VAT.
HMRC has announced its intention not to appeal against this ruling to the UK VAT Tribunal and therefore protective claims which have been made in relation to the Company will be processed by HMRC in due course.
The Company has accepted the Managers offer to refund 1,020,000 to the Company, representing all VAT charged on investment management fees for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 October 2007: this has been recognised in these financial statements and has been allocated to revenue and capital respectively, in accordance with the accounting policy Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust PLC 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued of the Company for the periods in which the VAT was charged.
The amount for earlier periods and the timescale for receipt are at present uncertain and the Company has therefore taken no account in these financial statements of any such repayment.
It is expected that repayments will be made by HMRC to the Manager in respect of VAT which has been charged on the Companys investment management fees in periods prior to 1 January 2004.
The Manager has undertaken to pass these amounts on to the Company, including any interest received, without undue delay.
The Manager is at present awaiting HMRCs confirmation of the amounts to be received and these are expected to come in two further tranches, one for VAT paid from 2001 to 2003 and the second covering the period from 1990 to 1996.
The timing of these payments is not certain, although we would expect the total amount, covering both those earlier periods, to be in excess of 1,000,000 plus interest, which will, once again, be split in accordance with the prevailing accounting policy.
The Company has not been charged VAT on its investment management fees from 1 November 2007.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The capital of the Company consists of equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

This review includes the nature and planned level of gearing, which takes account of the Managers views on the market and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
