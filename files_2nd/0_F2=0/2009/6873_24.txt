Exceptional items The following items, all relating to 2008, have been presented separately on the face of the consolidated income statement for the comparative period in order to show separately the underlying trading performance of the Group.
There are no such items for 2009.
Profit on disposal of properties During 2008 the Company had a profit on disposal of properties of 1,064,000, principally relating to the disposal of a freehold development site in Scotland.
Curtailment of defined benefit pension scheme An exceptional credit of 6,969,000 arose on the curtailment of the defined benefit scheme following a change in the calculation assumptions.
The scheme is now closed as regards the accrual of future benefits and the assumptions regarding future payments increases were therefore changed from being salary based to inflation based.
Restructuring costs A oneoff restructuring charge of 3,715,000 was taken in 2008 which reflected the expected exit costs from our Belgian operation, the costs of closing two Bakers Oven shops in January 2009 which were not suitable for conversion to Greggs, and an increase in previously disclosed provisions for the restructuring of Bakers Oven in the North and Scotland to reflect the worsening property market.
An additional charge of 1,263,000 arose in 2009 but this is not considered material in itself to merit disclosure as an exceptional item.
