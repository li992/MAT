The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 May 2009. a Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The most significant assumptions in the financial statements relate to the provisions for delinquent customers, which is referred to in the Business Review under principal risks.
These assumptions have been rigorously reviewed by the Audit Committee and the provision included in Accrued expenses and deferred income is 2.1m 2008: 2.0m.
By virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from presenting a profit and loss account.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom plus PLC and its subsidiary.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
39 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED d Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the income statement on acquisition.
e Revenue Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Transactions are recorded as sales when the delivery of products or performance of services takes place in accordance with the contract terms of sale.
f Interest income Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
g Leases Payments on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Taxation The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less a provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided on other assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 15 years Fixtures and fittings 7 years Leasehold improvements 3 years Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
40 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
ii Other intangible assets The Groups other intangible asset relates to a source code license for the software which is used by our billing and customer management systems.
It is stated at cost less a provision for amortisation, which has been calculated so as to write off the cost of the asset in equal instalments over five years.
The carrying amount of the intangible assets is reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
k Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
l Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments.
m Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including related overheads, and net realisable value.
Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
n Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
o Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks.
p Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
41 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED q Research and development Research costs are written off as incurred.
Development costs incurred in the development of new or substantially improved products and processes are capitalised as intangible assets if it is probable that the expenditure will generate future economic benefits and costs can be measured reliably.
r Share-based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
All share based remuneration is equity settled.
s Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Groups primary reporting format is business segments.
t Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
u Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees personal pension plans.
These are charged to the income statement in the year in which they become payable.
v Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
w New standards issued but not yet effective The Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.
It is not expected that adoption of standards or interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been adopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements.
Of these standards, IFRS 8 Operating segments and IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements will impact only on the presentation of the financial statements.
IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements and IFRS 3 Business combinations will only have an impact on future business combinations.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board.
They are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from interest rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments All financial assets, which include cash and trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of 80,568,000 2008: 60,212,000 and for the Company of 79,442,000 2008: 59,753,000.
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 57,334,000 2008: 35,507,000 and for the Company 55,516,000 2008: 33,539,000. Credit risk All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit, accordingly credit risk in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of whom represents an insignificant proportion of our total revenue.
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers.
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new customer who is not considered credit worthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone who submits a properly completed application form.
Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have used delinquent customers, there is likely to be a considerable delay before the Company is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from increasing their indebtedness are not always recoverable.
The provision for delinquent customers included in accrued expenses and deferred income is 2.1m 2008: 2.0m.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations primarily through the issue of equity shares and from cash generated and retained within the business.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank plc at money market rates to maximise returns.
The Group does not currently require any external loan funding.
The Groups profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK base rate of - 1% from current levels, due to the policy of placing funds on fixed rate deposit for terms of up to one year.
Commodity price risk The Group is not exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such fluctuations through to its customers.
Liquidity risk The Groups treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.
Generally the operations are strongly cash generating and the Group had significant surplus cash at the year end.
59 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Foreign currency risk The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Receivables due after one year comprise 1,698,000 2008: 1,035,000 due from employees and Distributors which earns interest at variable rates above Base Rate.
Borrowing facilities At 31 March 2009, the Group had no committed bank borrowing facilities 2008: nil and had a facility of 40,000,000 2008: 32,000,000 for Bonds, Guarantees and or Indemnities.
Subsequent to the year end, Barclays Bank plc have offered to increase the facility for Bonds, Guarantees and or Indemnities up to a maximum of 62,000,000 for the period until 30 June 2010, and to provide an overdraft facility of up to 5,000,000 and a money market loan of up to 10,000,000.
These facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a cross guarantee with the Companys subsidiary TML.
Fair values There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments and their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments.
