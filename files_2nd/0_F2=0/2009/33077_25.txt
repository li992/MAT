Vodafone is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates and the following items have reached litigation.
The Group holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise, however, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the overall profitability and cash flows of the Group in future periods.
The Groups subsidiary Vodafone 2 is responding to an enquiry by HMRC with regard to the UK tax treatment of one of its Luxembourg holding companies under the controlled foreign companies CFC rules.
Further details in relation to this enquiry are included in note 33 Contingent liabilities.
A Spanish subsidiary, Vodafone Holdings Europe SL VHESL, is in disagreement with the Spanish tax authorities regarding the tax treatment of interest expenses claimed by VHESL in the accounting periods ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004.
The matter is now being pursued through the Spanish court system.

Taxation continued At 31 March 2009, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 6-10 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 2 343 345 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 908 366 81,845 83,119 910 366 82,188 83,464 Included above are losses amounting to 1,940 million 2008: 1,969 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The losses above also include 77,780 million 2008: 82,204 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
Since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
In addition to the losses described above, the Group has potential tax losses of 46,716 million 2008: 40,181 million in respect of a write down in the value of investments in Germany.
These losses have to date been denied by the German tax authorities.
The outcome of the ongoing tax audit and the timing of the resolution are not yet known.
The Group has not recognised the availability of the losses, nor the income statement benefit arising from them, due to this uncertainty.
If upon resolution a benefit is recognised, it may impact both the amount of current income taxes provided since the date of initial deduction and the amount of the benefit from tax losses the Group will recognise.
The recognition of these benefits could affect the overall profitability of the Group in future periods.
The 6,535 million increase compared to the position at 31 March 2008 is due to foreign exchange.
The Group holds provisions in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 63,551 million 2008: 49,000 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.

Spain During the year ended 31 March 2009, the goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in Spain was impaired by 3,400 million following a fall in long term cash flow forecasts resulting from the economic downturn.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 January 2008 was 10.6%.
Turkey During the year ended 31 March 2009, the goodwill and other intangible assets in relation to the Groups operations in Turkey was impaired by 2,250 million.
At 30 September 2008, the goodwill was impaired by 1,700 million following adverse movements in the discount rate and adverse performance against previous plans.
During the second half of the 2009 financial year, impairment losses of 300 million in relation to goodwill and 250 million in relation to licences and spectrum resulted from adverse changes in both the discount rate and a fall in the long term GDP growth rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plans used for impairment testing were substantially unchanged from those used at 30 September 2008.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 January 2008 was 16.2%.
Ghana During the year ended 31 March 2009, the goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in Ghana was impaired by 250 million following an increase in the discount rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plan used for impairment testing was substantially unchanged from the acquisition business case.
Year ended 31 March 2007 Germany During the year ended 31 March 2007, the goodwill in relation to the Groups mobile operation in Germany was impaired by 6,700 million following an increase in long term interest rates and increased price competition in the German market along with continued regulatory pressures.
The impairment loss was based on a value in use calculation using a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate at 31 March 2007 of 10.6% 31 January 2008: 10.2%: 31 January 2007: 10.5%: 30 September 2006: 10.4%: 31 January 2006: 10.1%.
Italy During the year ended 31 March 2007, the goodwill in relation to the Groups mobile joint venture in Italy was impaired by 4,900 million.
During the second half of the 2007 financial year, 3,500 million of the impairment loss resulted from the estimated impact of legislation cancelling the fixed fees for the top up of prepaid cards and the related competitive response in the Italian market.
At 30 September 2006, the goodwill was impaired by 1,400 million, following an increase in long term interest rates.
The impairment loss was based on a value in use calculation using a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate at 31 March 2007 of 11.5% 31 January 2008: 11.5%: 31 January 2007: 11.2%: 30 September 2006: 10.9%: 31 January 2006: 10.1%.

Budgeted capital expenditure T he cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and includes the ongoing capital expenditure required to roll out networks in emerging markets, to provide enhanced voice and data products and services and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Groups licences.
Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software.
Long term growth rate For businesses where five years of management plan data is used for the Groups value in use calculations, a long term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the long term compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
For businesses where the ten years of management plan data is used for the Groups value in use calculations, a long term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years eight to ten of the management plan.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market, where possible adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the required increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Groups operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed mobile telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory.
Management has used a forward looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating acquisition proposals.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2009 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10.
Impairment continued Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
31 March 2009 The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups operations in Spain, Turkey and Ghana equalled their respective carrying value and, consequently, any adverse change in key assumption would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups operations in the UK, Ireland, Romania, Germany and Italy exceeded their carrying value by approximately 900 million, 60 million, 300 million, 9,250 million and 2,200 million respectively.
The tables below show the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation and, for the UK, Ireland, Romania, Germany and Italy, the amount by which each key assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying value in both cases.

Foreign exchange management As Vodafones primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange, its share price is quoted in sterling.
Since the sterling share price represents the value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, US dollars and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal multi-currency cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions denominated in other currencies above certain fide minimis levels.
As the Groups future cash flows are increasingly likely to be derived from emerging markets, it is likely that more debt in emerging market currencies will be drawn.
As such, at 31 March 2009, 117% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than sterling 57% euro, 46% US dollar and 14% other, while 17% of net debt had been purchased forward in sterling in anticipation of sterling denominated shareholder returns via dividends.
This allows euro, US dollar and other debt to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and, therefore, provides a partial hedge against income statement translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies.
Yen debt is used as a hedge against the value of yen assets as the Group has minimal yen cash flows.
A relative weakening in the value of sterling against certain currencies in which the Group maintains cash and cash equivalents has resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 371 million from currency translation differences in the year ended 31 March 2009 2008: 129 million.

Legal proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries are currently, and may be from time to time, involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from or discussions with governmental authorities, that are incidental to their operations.
However, save as disclosed below, the Company and its subsidiaries are not involved currently in any legal or arbitration proceedings including any governmental proceedings which are pending or known to be contemplated which may have, or have had in the 12 months preceding the date of this report, a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of the Company and its subsidiaries.
With the exception of the Vodafone 2 enquiry, due to inherent uncertainties, no accurate quantification of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings outlined below can be made.
The Company is one of a number of co-defendants in four actions filed in 2001 and 2002 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in the United States alleging personal injury, including brain cancer, from mobile phone use.
The Company is not aware that the health risks alleged in such personal injury claims have been substantiated and is vigorously defending such claims.
In August 2007, the court dismissed all four actions against the Company on the basis of the federal pre-emption doctrine.
The plaintiffs have appealed this dismissal.
A subsidiary of the Company, Vodafone 2, is responding to an enquiry the Vodafone 2 enquiry by HMRC with regard to the UK tax treatment of its Luxembourg holding company, Vodafone Investments Luxembourg SARL VIL, under the Controlled Foreign Companies section of the UKs Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 the CFC Regime relating to the tax treatment of profits earned by the holding company for the accounting period ended 31 March 2001.
Vodafone 2s position is that it is not liable for corporation tax in the UK under the CFC Regime in respect of VIL.
Vodafone 2 asserts, inter alia, that the CFC Regime is contrary to EU law and has made an application to the Special Commissioners of HMRC for closure of the Vodafone 2 enquiry.
In May 2005, the Special Commissioners referred certain questions relating to the compatibility of the CFC Regime with EU law to the European Court of Justice the ECJ for determination the Vodafone 2 reference.
HMRC subsequently appealed against the decision of the Special Commissioners to make the Vodafone 2 reference but its appeal was rejected by both the High Court and Court of Appeal.
114 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2009 Financials In September 2006, the ECJ determined in the Cadbury Schweppes case C-196 04 the Cadbury Schweppes Judgment that the CFC Regime is incompatible with EU law unless it applies only to wholly artificial arrangements intended to escape national tax normally payable wholly artificial arrangements.
At a hearing in March 2007, the Special Commissioners heard submissions from Vodafone 2 and HMRC, in light of the Cadbury Schweppes Judgment, as to whether the CFC regime can be interpreted as applying only to wholly artificial arrangements and whether the Vodafone 2 reference should be maintained or withdrawn by the Special Commissioners.
On 26 July 2007, the Special Commissioners handed down their judgment on these questions.
The tribunal decided on the basis of the casting vote of the Presiding Special Commissioner that the CFC regime can be interpreted as applying only to wholly artificial arrangements and that the Vodafone 2 reference should be withdrawn.
Vodafone 2 appealed these decisions to the High Court and this appeal was heard in May 2008.
The High Court granted Vodafone 2s appeal on 4 July 2008, holding that the CFC regime could not be interpreted consistently with EU law and that, therefore, the Vodafone 2 enquiry should be closed.
HMRC has appealed the High Courts findings to the Court of Appeal.
The High Courts order requiring HMRC to close the Vodafone 2 enquiry has been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.
In light of the High Courts decision, the Special Commissioners withdrew the Vodafone 2 reference on 17 July 2008.
The hearing of the Vodafone 2 appeal was heard on 6 and 7 May 2009.
The Company is awaiting the High Courts decision.
The Company has taken provisions, which at 31 March 2009 amounted to approximately 2.3 billion, for the potential UK corporation tax liability and related interest expense that may arise in connection with the Vodafone 2 enquiry.
The provisions relate to the accounting period which is the subject of the proceedings described above as well as to accounting periods after 31 March 2001 to date.
The provisions at 31 March 2009 reflect the developments during the year.
The Company has previously been served with a complaint filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by Cem Uzan and others against the Company, Vodafone Telekomunikasyon A. S. VTAS, Vodafone Holding A. S. and others.
The plaintiffs made certain allegations in connection with the sale of the assets of the Turkish company Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A. S. Telsim to the Groups Turkish subsidiary, which acquired the assets from the SDIF, a public agency of the Turkish state, in a public auction in Turkey pursuant to Turkish law in which a number of mobile telecommunications companies participated.
The plaintiffs sought an order requiring the return to them of Telsims assets or else an award of damages.
The plaintiffs discontinued the complaint with prejudice in August 2008.
The court disposed of the case on 24 October 2008.
On 12 November 2007, the Company became aware of the filing of a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by The City of Edinburgh Council on behalf of the Lothian Pension Fund Lothian against the Company and certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors for alleged violations of US federal securities laws.
The complaint alleged that the Companys financial statements and certain disclosures between 10 June 2004 and 27 February 2006 were materially false and misleading, among other things, as a result of the Companys alleged failure to report on a timely basis a write-down for the impaired value of Vodafones German, Italian and Japanese subsidiaries.
The complaint seeks compensatory damages of an unspecified amount and other relief on behalf of a putative class comprised of all persons who purchased publicly traded securities, including ordinary shares and American depositary receipts, of the Company between 10 June 2004 and 27 February 2006.
The plaintiff subsequently served the complaint and, on or about 27 March 2008, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, asserting substantially the same claims against the same defendants on behalf of the same putative investor class.
Thereafter, an additional plaintiff, a US pension fund that purportedly purchased Vodafone ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange, was added as an additional plaintiff by stipulated order.
The Company believes that the allegations are without merit and filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on 6 June 2008.
By judgment entered on 1 December 2008, the court dismissed the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of that dismissal, arguing that the court overlooked the claims of the US pension fund, as to which there had been no subject matter jurisdiction challenge.
On 9 April 2009, the court granted that motion to the extent that it sought reopening of the action for the purpose of adjudication of the claims asserted on behalf of the US pension fund, but denied the motion with respect to the dismissal of Lothians claims.
The court ordered the case re-opened pending consideration and order with respect to other arguments of the Company in its motion to dismiss in connection with which the court also indicated it will address any arguments regarding supplemental jurisdiction over Lothians claims.
The Company is awaiting the Courts further consideration and order.
Vodafone Essar Limited VEL and Vodafone International Holdings B. V. VIHBV each received notices in August 2007 and September 2007, respectively, from the Indian tax authorities alleging potential liability in connection with alleged failure by VIHBV to deduct withholding tax from consideration paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group HTIL in respect of HTILs gain on its disposal to VIHBV of its interests in a wholly-owned subsidiary that indirectly holds interests in VEL.
Following the receipt of such notices, VEL and VIHBV each filed writs seeking orders that their respective notices be quashed and that the tax authorities take no further steps under the notices.
Initial hearings have been held before the Bombay High Court and in the case of VIHBV, the High Court heard the writ in June 2008.
In December 2008, the High Court dismissed VIHBVs writ.
VIHBV subsequently filed a special leave petition to the Supreme Court to appeal the High Courts dismissal of the writ.
On 23 January 2009, the Supreme Court referred the question of the tax authoritys jurisdiction to seek to pursue tax back to the tax authority for adjudication on the facts with permission granted to VIHBV to appeal that decision back to the High Court should VIHBV disagree with the tax authoritys findings.
VELs case continues to be stayed pending the outcome of the VIHBV hearing.
VIHBV believes that neither it nor any other member of the Group is liable for such withholding tax and intends to defend this position vigorously.

Change in accounting policy During the year, the Group changed its accounting policy with respect to the acquisition of minority interests in subsidiaries.
The Group now applies the economic entity method, under which such transactions are accounted for as transactions between shareholders and there is no remeasurement to fair value of net assets acquired that were previously attributable to minority shareholders.
Prior to this change in policy, the Group applied the parent company method to such transactions, and assets attributable to minority interests immediately prior to the respective acquisition, including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, were remeasured to fair value at the date of acquisition.
The Group believes the new policy is preferable as it more closely aligns the accounting for these transactions with the treatment of minority interest as a component of equity and will aid comparability.
The impact of this voluntary change in accounting policy on the consolidated financial statements is primarily to reduce goodwill and acquired intangible assets and related income statement amounts arising on such transactions.
This change did not result in a material impact on the current year or any years included within these consolidated financial statements.
