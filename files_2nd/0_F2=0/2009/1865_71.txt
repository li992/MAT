statements Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 96 Company balance sheet 31 March 2007.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK defi ned benefi t plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated 96 Accounting policies of with pensioner members.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the the Company plan.

financial statements 102 Principal subsidiary The UK defi ned benefi t BBA Income and Protection Plan IPP was closed to new members in 2002.
During the second half of 2009, the Company consulted undertakings with the active members of the IPP with a view to changing the benefi ts payable to members to address the defi cit expected to arise out of the 2009 valuation, 103 Five year summary and also to restrict the increasing cost of providing defi ned benefi t pensions and thereby place the plan on a more secure fi financial footing and make provision 104 Shareholder information of benefi ts more sustainable in the future.

These changes are expected to have an immediate impact in reducing the ongoing cost of pension provision and reducing BBA Aviations net liability to the pension plan, and are expected to be taken into account in the fi nalisation of the 2009 valuation.
