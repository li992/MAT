82 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Adoption of new and revised standards The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
IAS 1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial statements IAS 1 2007 has introduced a number of changes in format and contents of the financial statements.
IAS 23 revised 2007 The principal change to the Standard was to eliminate the option to expense all Borrowing Costs borrowing costs when incurred.
This change has had no impact on these financial statements because it has always been the Groups accounting policy to capitalise borrowing costs incurred on qualifying assets.
Amendments to IAS 32 The revisions to IAS 32 amend the criteria for debt equity classification by permitting Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation certain puttable financial instruments and instruments or components of instruments of Financial Statements Puttable Financial Instruments that impose on an entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rate share of and Obligations Arising on Liquidation the net assets of the entity only on liquidation, to be classified as equity, subject to specified criteria being met.
Amendments to IAS 39 The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge accounting: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement identifying inflation as a hedged risk or portion, and hedging with options.
Eligible Hedged Items Embedded Derivatives Amendments to IFRIC 9 The amendments clarify the accounting for embedded derivatives in the case of Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39 a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement FVTPL category as permitted by the October 2008 amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement see above.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and returns approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures value measurements and liquidity risk.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment The amendments clarify the definition of vesting conditions for the purposes of Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 2, introduce the concept of non-vesting conditions and clarify the accounting treatment for cancellations.
Amendments to IAS 20 Accounting for Government IAS 20 has been amended to require that the benefit of a government loan at a Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance below-market rate of interest to be treated as a government grant.
This accounting treatment was not permitted prior to this amendment.
Adoption of new and revised standards continued IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation The Interpretation provides guidance on the detailed requirements for net investment hedging for certain hedge accounting designations.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from customers The Interpretation addresses the accounting by recipients for transfers of property, plant and equipment from customers and concludes what item of property, plant and equipment transferred meets the definition of an asset from the perspective of the recipient, the recipient should recognise the asset at its fair value on the date of transfer, with the credit recognised in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 2 amended Group cash-settled share based payment transactions IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IAS 24 amended Related Party Disclosures IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised 2008 Investments in Associates IAS 32 amended Classification of Rights Issues IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirements IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments Improvements to IFRSs April 2009 The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries and associates when IFRS 3 revised 2008, IAS 27 revised 2008 and IAS 28 revised 2008 come into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2010.
Significant accounting policies General Information Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on page 131.
Basis of accounting Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLCs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to market of certain financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups previously published financial statements were also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The presentational and functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is the US Dollar as the majority of the Companys business is conducted in US Dollars USD.
The significant accounting policies are set out below.
84 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Notes to the consolidated statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC the Company and entities controlled by the Company together the Group and the Groups share of the results and net assets of its associates.
Control is achieved where the Company has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies either directly or indirectly of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
The non-controlling interest is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements see page 60.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but not control or joint control over these policies.
Investment in joint venture A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and a third party undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity, and exists only when the strategic financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control the venturers.
Each venturer contributes cash or other resources to the jointly controlled entity.
These contributions are included in the accounting records of the venturer and recognised in its financial statements as an investment in the jointly controlled entity.
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using proportionate consolidation.
The application of proportionate consolidation means that the balance sheet of the Group includes its share of the assets that it controls jointly and its share of the liabilities for which it is jointly responsible.
Significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets a Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequent when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Marketing rights are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights first generate sales.
c Customer relationships represent the value attributed to the long term relationships held with existing customers at the date of acquisition and are amortised over their useful economic life.
d Product related intangibles i product files and under-licenced products are assigned indefinite useful lives which are reviewed for impairment at least annually: and ii Under licence agreements and product dossiers are amortised over their useful lives in the year of acquisition.
e Purchased software is amortised over the useful economic lives when the asset is available for use.
f In process research and development recognised on acquisition is amortised over the useful life in the year of acquisition.
g Trade name some trade names are assigned indefinite useful lives and others have finite useful lives over which they are amortised where applicable, in the period from acquisition.
Foreign currencies For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US dollars, the functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and the presentational currency of the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in currencies other than local currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value and the related foreign exchange are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers against orders received and when title and risk of loss has passed.
Revenue represents the amounts receivable after the deduction of discounts, value added tax, other sales taxes, and allowances given, provisions for chargebacks and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns.
The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and historical information and past experience.
86 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.
In the USA the Group sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies.
The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and Group purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.
The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products.
The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices.
The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesalers invoice price.
This credit is called a chargeback.
The provision for chargebacks is based on historical sell-through levels by the Groups wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
As sales are made to the large wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves.
Returns and rebates In certain countries and consistent with industry practice, the Group has a product return policy that allows selected customers to return the product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date, in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases.
The Group estimates its provision for returns and rebates based on historical experience, changes to business practices and credit terms.
While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns.
The Group continually monitors the provisions for returns and rebates, and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves.
Price adjustments Price adjustments, also known as shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the Groups products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction.
Decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by Group management to reflect competitive market conditions.
Amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated declines in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers.
The Group regularly monitors these and other factors and re-evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
To the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash flow hedge of interest rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is deferred in equity and released to profit or loss when the qualifying asset impacts profit or loss.
To the extent that fixed rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk, the capitalised borrowing costs reflect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend income Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classified as capital leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under capital leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a capital lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Significant accounting policies continued Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the statement of comprehensive income over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Research and development Research and development expenses are fully charged to the statement of comprehensive income, as the Group considers that the regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of its products generally mean that the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible assets are not met.
Where, however the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets will be recognised and amortised over their useful economic life.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Tax The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates.
Furthermore, the Group computes and records deferred tax assets and liabilities according to IAS 12 Income Taxes.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payments requires an expense to be recognised when the Group buys goods or services in exchange for share or rights over shares share-based payments or in exchange for other equivalent assets.
The cost of share based payments transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which the share based payments are granted.
The fair value of the equity settled stock options scheme is determined using a binomial model.
The fair value of the long-term incentive plan is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations further details are given in note 36.
In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the market price of the shares of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC.
88 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments continued The cost of share-based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of a share-based payments award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the modification date.
Where a share based payments award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for a cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share based payments is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment have been stated at cost on acquisition and are depreciated, except for land, on a straight-line basis at the following depreciation rates: Buildings 2% to 4% Vehicles 10% to 20% Fixtures & equipment 6% to 33% Projects under construction are not depreciated until construction has been completed.
Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalised.
Property, plant and equipment which are financed by leases giving Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, and depreciated in the same manner as other property, plant and equipment over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life.
Whenever the recoverable amount of an asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
Projects under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Purchased products are stated at acquisition cost and all other costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost of own-manufactured products comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
In the balance sheet, inventory is primarily valued at standard cost, which approximates to historical cost determined on a moving average basis, and this value is used to determine the cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Provisions are made for inventories with net realisable value lower than cost or for slow moving inventory.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The principal derivative instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and then re-measured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as fair value hedges are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the statement of comprehensive income in line with the hedged forecast transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Significant accounting policies continued Investments Available for sale investments with quoted market prices are initially recognised at cost on acquisition and re-measured to their fair values at year-end.
Gains or losses on re-measurement to fair value are recognised in shareholders equity until the investments are sold, disposed of, or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gains or loss relating to these investments previously recognised in equity is included in the statement of comprehensive income.
Available for sale financial assets without market prices and the fair value of which cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, less a provision for any impairment loss, which is taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of quoted financial assets represents the closing price in the financial markets at the date of the financial statements.
However, the fair value of unquoted financial assets, or those with no declared price are estimated by comparing the fair value of a similar financial instrument or through a discounted cash flow method.
Accounts receivable Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or income-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset income-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
90 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The Groups management believes that, among others, the following accounting policies that involve management judgements and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Groups financial results.
Chargebacks see details above Revenue recognition The Groups revenue recognition policies require management to make a number of estimates, with the most significant relating to chargebacks, product returns, rebates and price adjustments which vary by product arrangements and buying groups.
Accounts receivable and bad debts The Group estimates, based on its historical experience, the level of debts that it believes will not be collected.
Such estimates are made when collection of the full amount of the debt is no longer probable.
These estimates are based on a number of factors including specific customer issues and industry, economic and political conditions.
Bad debts are written-off when identified.
Goodwill and intangible assets The critical areas of judgement in relation to goodwill and intangible assets are the useful economic lives of the product-related intangibles and the growth rates used in the impairment tests for goodwill.
Contingent liabilities The Group is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business relating to employment, product liability and other commercial disputes.
Often this litigation is subject to substantial uncertainties, and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained or an estimate of the amount of any loss, is difficult to ascertain.
Consequently, it is often not practicable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible financial effect, if any, that could arise from the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings.
In such cases, where the Group believes that a disclosure is required, information regarding the nature and facts of the case is disclosed.
For current matters see Note 35.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of the disclosed legal proceeding, based on managements current and considered view, the Group does not expect it to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position.
This position could change over time.
Segmental reporting For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions Generic, Branded and Injectables.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
The Group discloses underlying operating profit as the measure of segment result as this is the measure used in the decision-making and resource allocation process of the chief operating decision maker, who is the Groups Chief Executive Officer.
Information regarding the Groups operating segments is reported below.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 $000s $000s Branded Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Co. 74,399 74,399 Al Jazeera Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd 6,752 6,752 Hikma Pharma SAE Egypt 34,877 34,680 116,028 115,831 Injectables German operations 37,787 37,162 Hikma Italia S. p.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value in use calculations are based on the budget for the following year, grown at 2% in perpetuity.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and short-term growth forecast in budgets.
Management estimates discount rates using WACC rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The discount rates used varied between 8.4% and 13.4%.
The short-term growth rates range from 17% to 78%.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2009 2008 $000s $000s Deferred tax liabilities 11,734 12,425 Deferred tax assets 18,793 13,305 7,059 880 No deferred tax asset has been recognised on tax losses totalling USD 3,873,000 2008: USD 6,647,000 due to the unpredictability of the related future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward for four years before expiry.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of USD 30 million 2008: USD 246 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

The average lease term is four years 2008: five years.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the average effective borrowings rate was between 1.8% and 7.0% 2008: between 3.9% and 7.0%.
Financial policies for risk management and their objectives Credit and concentration of risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks in the US, expired goods and without recourse discounts.
A provision for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to clients in Europe and the US.
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Groups largest three clients in the MENA region represented 21% of Group Turnover, 15% in Saudi Arabia and two customers in Algeria making up 4% and 2% each.
The amount of receivables due from customers based in the Algerian market at 31 December 2009 is USD 32,016,596 2008: USD 32,784,000 and Saudi Arabia is USD 53,373,000 2008: USD 44,366,000.
The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies and procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the creditworthiness of a particular customer.
The Group is exposed to a variety of customers ranging from government backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic risks vary across the Group.
Typical credit terms in the US range from 3060 days, in Europe 60120 days, and MENA 180360 days.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Market risk The Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses the USD as its functional currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in the Euro and Algerian Dinar.
Consequently, where possible the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of debt that is fixed by entering into interest rate swap agreements.
Using these derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31 December 2009 or the Groups results of operations for the year then ended.

Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at 31 December 2009, a 1% increase decrease in interest rates would result in an additional USD 1.4 million 2008: USD 2.0 million in interest expense income being incurred per year.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount: Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments: Long-term loans approximates to the carrying amount in the case of floating rate bank loans and other loans: Forward exchange contracts based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date: Receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount: and Lease obligations approximates to the carrying value.
Management considers that the book value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities does not materially differ from their fair value.
Currency risk Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is other than the functional currency of the booking entity and being of a monetary nature.
The currencies that have a significant impact on the Group accounts and the exchange rates used are as follows: Period end rates Average rates 2009 2008 2009 2008 USD EUR 0.6977 0.7094 0.7170 0.6797 USD Sudanese Pound 2.2398 2.1840 2.3173 2.0924 USD Algerian Dinar 72.7309 71.1999 72.6817 64.4330 USD Saudi Riyal 3.7495 3.7495 3.7495 3.7495 USD British Pound 0.6278 0.6907 0.6386 0.5390 USD Jordanian Dinar 0.7090 0.7090 0.7090 0.7090 USD Egyptian Pound 5.5051 5.5375 5.5776 5.4557 The Jordanian Dinar and Saudi Riyal have no impact on the statement of comprehensive income as those currencies are pegged against the US Dollar.

USD 95,451,783 2008: USD 33,000,000 of these was committed and the remainder was uncommitted.
Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At the balance sheet date the Group was not committed to any outstanding forward exchange contracts.
The total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed to, have been translated at 31 December exchange rates as below.
2009 2008 $000s $000s Foreign exchange forward contracts and options Euro 3,552 Foreign exchange forward contracts Yen 443 These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures.
At 31 December 2008 the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives all of which were designated as effective cash flow hedges was an asset of USD 382,000.
The movement in fair value in the year resulted in a loss of USD 382,000 2008: USD 407,000 net gain which has been reflected in equity.
These amounts were based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of cash flow hedges of currency and interest rate fluctuations is not significant and will not materially affect the financial position of the Group.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
These contracts have nominal values of USD 34.4 million 2008: USD 22.8 million and have fixed interest payments at rates ranging from 1.91% to 4.75% 2008: 3.9% to 4.75[%] for periods up until 2016 and have floating interest receipts at LIBOR or EURIBOR.
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated as a liability of USD 932,000 2008: liability of USD 896,000.
These amounts are based on market values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Some of these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges and the movement in fair value totalling a gain of USD 180,000 2008: USD loss of 485,000 has been reflected in equity.
The remaining outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group was committed to at year end are held at fair value through profit and loss.
A loss of USD 216,000 has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2009 2008: loss of [USD] 329,000 in respect of such derivatives.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of interest rate swaps by interest rate fluctuations will not materially affect the financial position of the Group.

Contingent liabilities The Group was contingently liable for letters of guarantee and letters of credit totalling USD 62.4 million 2008: USD 23.6 million.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is ongoing.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industry the Group is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including litigation relating to employment, product liability and other commercial disputes.
In particular, West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp. is a co-defendant, with four other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, in litigation brought by Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. regarding the continued sale by West-ward and the others of generic oral colchicine in the United States, TM following the approval by the FDA of Mutuals Colcrys colchicine product the Claim.
Pursuant to the Claim, Mutual alleges unfair competition and false advertising by the Defendants in respect of their sale of oral colchicine, and seeks damages for loss of sales.
The Claim was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and subsequently, on petition by the Defendants, transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
At the same time as the transfer of the Claim to the District of New Jersey, the Court denied a preliminary injunction that Mutual had sought to prevent the Defendants from continuing their alleged unfair competition and false advertising pending the final outcome of the Claim, finding that Mutual had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.
Discovery is ongoing, and on 12 March 2010, the Court made a scheduling order for the purpose of setting a final schedule to govern further proceedings in the case.
This matter remains subject to substantial uncertainties.
As this litigation is at an early stage, it is also not practicable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible financial effect, if any, that could arise.
Management has assessed and considered all the relevant facts of the litigation and having done so does not consider that a provision is required to be made in respect of the Claim see note 3.
Share-based payments Equity settled share option scheme During the year ended 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Company had one stock option compensation scheme settled by equity instruments, with four separate grant dates.
The options over these instruments are settled in equity once exercised.
Details of the grants under the scheme are shown below: 2008 Type of arrangement General employee share option plan Date of grant 4 November 2008 Number granted 85,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $1.14.
This was calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $5.45, exercise price of $5.45, expected volatility of 34.9%, expected dividend yield of 1.21%, expected average contractual life of 4 years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.11%.
It was assumed that each Option tranche will be exercised within one year of the date of vesting.
2008 Type of arrangement General employee share option plan Date of grant 29 April 2008 Number granted 1,041,500 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $2.61.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $9.19, exercise price of $9.19, expected volatility of 31.5%, expected dividend yield of 0.08%, expected average contractual life of 3.8 years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.54%.
It was assumed that each Option tranche will be exercised within one year of the date of vesting apart from the final Option tranche which will be exercised immediately on vesting given the five year time scale.
Share-based payments continued 2005 Type of arrangement General employee share option plan Date of grant 13 October 2005 Number granted 1,600,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $0.74.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $4.50, exercise price of $4.50, expected volatility of 26.2%, expected dividend yield of 6.67%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.54%.
To allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options immediately after vesting date.
2004 Type of arrangement General employee share option plan Date of grant 12 October 2004 Number granted 9,520,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $0.35.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $0.91, exercise price of $0.91, expected volatility of 44.8%, expected dividend yield of 3.85%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.22%.
Further details of the general employee share option plan are as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise Number of exercise shares option price in $ shares option price in $ Outstanding at 1 January 6,201,800 2.73 6,859,400 1.43 Granted during the year 85,000 5.45 1,041,500 9.19 Exercised during the year 2,390,000 1.34 1,503,800 1.12 Expired during the year 251,100 6.83 195,300 4.47 Outstanding at 31 December 3,645,700 3.42 6,201,800 2.73 Exercisable at 31 December 2,682,900 1.85 2,830,400 1.39 The cost of the equity settled share option scheme of USD 1,245,000 2008: USD 1,487,000 has been recorded in the statement of comprehensive income as part of general and administrative expenses.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was USD 7.14.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of one year.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three to four years.
Long-term incentive plan During 2007, 2008 and 2009 year, the Company granted awards under Hikma Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP to certain employees.
Under the LTIP, conditional awards of nil cost options are made which vest after three years subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance condition.
This condition measures the Groups TSR relative to a comparator group of other pharmaceutical companies.
In this case, the vesting schedule dictates that 20% of awards vest for median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance, with pro-rata vesting in between these points.
No awards vest for performance which is below the median.
