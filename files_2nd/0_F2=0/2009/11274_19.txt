The CGUs have been defined as the operating business to which the goodwill relates.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2009 2008 m m Solway Foods 30.1 30.1 Ethnic Cuisine 5.1 5.1 Green Isle 20.1 17.8 Convenience Foods 1.8 1.8 57.1 54.8 Impairment tests for goodwill The Group tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, gross margin and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The key assumptions are based on past experience which has been adjusted for expected changes in future conditions.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate used is not more than 3.0% 2007 08: not more than 3.0%, and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs are based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.1% 2007 08: 11.1%.
The recoverable amount for each CGU exceeded its carrying value at the impairment test date.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis based on reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions used for the impairment test.
This has not resulted in any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill as at 28 March 2009.
In relation to Ethnic Cuisine, reasonable possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount of Ethnic Cuisine is 23.0% higher than the carrying amount and a reduction of 3.0% in the gross margin percentage or a reduction of 3.0% in forecast sales would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Management believe that these balances have low credit risk because the Groups top five customers, all leading UK retailers, represent 77% of the Groups revenue.
This results in a high concentration of credit risk, however, these customers have good credit ratings and consequently the credit risk for the Groups overall trade receivables is considered low.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system and trade references to assess potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Included in the trade receivables balance are receivables with a carrying amount of 6.4m 2007 08 9.5m which are past due at the period end for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The amount drawn down is repayable in periods of up to one year but is capable of being immediately refinanced as part of the committed Revolving credit facility 2010.
The rate of interest fluctuates in line with market rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
In March 2009 the Group established a Forward Start banking facility of 250.0m to July 2012 which will replace the existing 460.0m Revolving credit facility on expiry in July 2010.
In April 2009, the existing facility was reduced from 460.0m to 305.0m.
The current facility banking covenants are calculated under Frozen UK GAAP.
The new facility covenants will be calculated under IFRS from July 2010.
The new financing costs agreed as part of the Forward Start facility were effective from 25 March 2009.
The maturity profile of the Revolving credit facility 2010 is shown below.
This assumes that the interest paid during future years is paid at the expected future interest rate 5.83% and the level of debt drawn down remains consistent with borrowings at the balance sheet date.

Notes are in both US Dollars $155.0m and pounds Sterling 54.3m.
The notes are fixed rate and unsecured.
The maturity profile below shows the annual cash flows paid in both the current and prior year.
The cash flow hedge is currently effective.
In consequence, the interest payments are fixed and are accounted for in the Consolidated income statement on an accruals basis.
The charge to the Consolidated income statement corresponds to the annual interest paid.
The repayment of the principal amount will not enter into the determination of profit or loss unless the hedge becomes ineffective.
The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge is assessed at each balance sheet date.

The weighted average interest rate payable in pounds Sterling by the Company is approximately 5.5%.
Additionally, the swap contracts provide for an exchange of the principal amounts at maturity at the same rate of exchange as the initial principal was translated 1 $1.752.
At the period end, the carrying value of the Senior loan notes 20122017 was 162.0m 2007 08: 131.6m and the derivative financial instrument on the cross currency interest rate swaps was an asset of 26.6m 2007 08: liability 4.1m.

25 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, as disclosed in note 26, and equity shareholders funds, as disclosed in notes 28 and 29.
Board policy is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20% to 50% of total net debt over the medium term, although the Group may operate outside of this range in the short term.
At the year end 78% of the Groups debt was fixed 2007 08: 71%.
The proportion of fixed rate borrowings increased after the business disposals made during 2006 07.
The Groups net debt position is maintained daily and reviewed by management on a weekly basis.
During the period, the Company repurchased 17,490,115 shares at a cost of 11.0m 2007 08: 6,056,846 shares at a cost of 5.3m.

The fair value of the trading investments and cash and cash equivalents are based on their market value.
The fair values of the financial assets that are designated and effective as hedging instruments, have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying period end exchange rates.
The directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for derivatives that are designated and effective as hedging instruments carried at fair value, but that are not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied and assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument.
The fair value of the other financial liabilities at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value.
The trade and other payables approximate to their fair value due to the short term nature of the payables.
The bank loans and overdrafts and the Revolving credit facility 2010 approximate to their fair value based on their variable market rate.
The finance lease fair value approximates to the carrying value based on discounted future cash flows.
Financial risk management objectives The Group collates information from across the business and reports to the Board of directors on key financial risks on a monthly basis.
These risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to these risks by using derivative financial instruments where applicable.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policies which have been approved by the Board of directors.
The Group only enters into trade financial instruments for specific purposes.
Speculative purchases are not made.
See page 87 for further details.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations of the loans and receivables at amortised cost held in the balance sheet.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The Groups top five customers, all leading UK retailers, continue to represent 77% of the Groups revenue.
These customers have favourable credit ratings and consequently reduce the credit risk for the Groups overall trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Processes are in place to manage receivables and overdue debt and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to resolve issues on a timely basis.
Credit control operating procedures are in place to review all new customers.
Existing customers are reviewed as management become aware of changes of circumstances for specific customers.
During the period, the amount written off in respect of credit risk was 0.7m 2007 08: 0.3m.
Highlights Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 85 Northern Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2008 09 25 Financial instruments continued The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of appropriate allowance for doubtful trade receivables, specific customer risk and assessment of the current economic environment.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not be able to fund the day to day running of the Group.
Liquidity risk is reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group also monitors the drawdown of debt against the available banking facilities and reviews the level of reserves.
Liquidity risk management ensures sufficient debt funding is available for the Groups day to day needs.
Board policy is to maintain reasonable headroom of unused committed bank facilities in a range of maturities at least 12 months beyond the period end.
The Group has two principal debt facilities notes 23 and 24 : Revolving credit facility 2010 extended to 2012 through the Forward Start facility Senior loan notes 20122017 The Board also monitors the Groups banking covenants which are calculated under Frozen UK GAAP.
When the Forward Start Revolving credit facility begins in July 2010 the covenants will be calculated under IFRS.
No breaches have been made during the year or prior period.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Interest risk management balances debt financing as a tool to improve the returns through leverage in the capital structure with the potential for an increase in interest rates to impact profits negatively.
Board policy is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20% to 50% of total net borrowings over the medium term although the Group may operate outside this range in the short term.
At the year end 78% of the Groups net debt is fixed 2007 08: 71%.
Board approval is required for the use of any interest rate derivative.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis has been performed on the financial assets and liabilities to illustrate the impact on Group profits and equity if interest rates increased decreased.
This analysis assumes the liabilities outstanding at the period end were outstanding for the whole period.
A 100 bps increase or decrease has been used, comprising managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 bps higher lower, then profit before taxation for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2009 would have decreased increased by 1.2m 2007 08: 1.3m and equity at the balance sheet date would have decreased increased by 1.2m 2007 08: 1.3m.
It has been assumed that all other variables remained the same when preparing the interest rate sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management Foreign currency risk management occurs at a transactional level on revenues and purchases in foreign currencies and at a translational level in relation to the translation of overseas operations.
Board policy is for UK businesses to hedge transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts wherever material.
Transactional exposure in our Irish business has been partly hedged during the year.
The remaining transactional exposure is partially offset by a translation exposure.
The Senior loan notes 20122017 have been hedged using cross currency interest rate swaps of equivalent maturity subject to a one off right for the counterparty bank to break the swap after seven years at the market value of the swap at that date.
The Group monitors foreign exchange rates to assess the potential impact on Group profits if exchange rates move significantly and a summary of hedges in place is reported monthly to the Board.
The Groups main foreign exchange risk is to the Euro.
During the 52 week period to 28 March 2009, the Euro strengthened against GBP by 14.7%, mainly in the second half of the year, with the closing rate at a1.0765 compared to a1.2621 at the prior period end.
The average rate for the 52 week period to 28 March 2009 was a1.2058, a reduction of 15.1% versus prior year.
The net impact of the stronger Euro on our Euro manufacturing base reduced overall profitability by 5.0m.
The overseas subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, has pounds Sterling assets and liabilities at both balance sheet dates.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on these pounds Sterling financial assets and liabilities to sensitivity of a 10% increase decrease in pounds Sterling to Euro exchange rate.
A 10% increase decrease has been used, comprising managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in Euro exchange rates.
The impact on profit for the period is an increase decrease of 0.4m 2007 08: increase decrease of 0.3m and the impact on equity is an increase decrease of 0.4m 2007 08: increase decrease of 0.3m.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the financial assets and liabilities to sensitivity of a 10% increase decrease in the pounds Sterling to US Dollar exchange rate.

Highlights Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 87 Northern Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2008 09 25 Financial instruments continued Forward foreign exchange contracts Group policy is to hedge individual capital expenditure foreign currency transactions of more than 0.3m.
During 2008 09 the Group also entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge an element of Sterling sales in the Irish business.
The contracts are fair valued at the period end and the Group tests the effectiveness of the hedge using the hypothetical derivative method.
The cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative is compared to the cumulative fair value changes of the hedge instrument.
All outstanding contracts at the period end will vest within one year.

Cross currency interest rate swaps The Company has cross currency interest rate swaps to provide a cash flow hedge against currency and interest rate movements on the US$155.0m Senior loan notes 20122017.
Swap contracts with a nominal value of US$155.0m 88.5m have fixed Sterling interest payments at an average rate of 5.5% for periods up to 2017 and have fixed US Dollar interest receipts at an average rate of 5.76%.
At the period end, swap contracts had a fair value of 26.6m 2007 08: negative 4.1m.
The cash flow hedge forms part of the Groups risk management strategy which is reviewed and authorised by the Board.
The fixed cash flows will be achieved through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps.
The actual risk being hedged is the foreign exchange risk.
The Group uses the Dollar offset hypothetical derivative method to test the effectiveness of the hedge.
The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward foreign exchange rates and yield curves from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The maturity profile is shown on page 83.
26 Analysis of net debt References to net debt refer to the total borrowings of the Group, including both short term and long term bank loans, bonds, loan notes and finance leases, after offsetting the cash and cash equivalents of the business and short term investments.
Net debt will also include the proportion of the fair value of the currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the Groups US Dollar denominated loan notes.
The table below reconciles net debt: 2009 2008 m m Cash and cash equivalents 60.8 72.9 Trading investments 0.1 0.1 Bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes due within one year 9.9 0.3 Finance leases 0.5 0.8 Revolving credit facility 2010 115.0 130.0 Senior loan notes 20122017 162.0 131.6 Currency element of fair value of swaps hedging the Groups US Dollar denominated loan notes 19.8 10.5 Net debt 206.7 200.2 Net debt Net debt is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled non-IFRS debt measures reported by other companies.
The Group adopts this measure because it is used in calculating the banking covenants.
It is also the measure used for internal debt analysis.
In addition, the net debt balance provides an indication of the net borrowings on which the Company is required to pay interest.

Highlights Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 93 Northern Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2008 09 34 Equity settled share based payments continued Performance conditions notes A Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The target requires that the real growth in earnings per share over the three year performance period is greater than 3% per annum compound.
The performance condition allowed for retesting after years four and five against the full period from the grant.
B Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The performance condition does not allow for retesting.
C The LTIP has two performance conditions: TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on how the TSR in relation to an ordinary share of Northern Foods over the relevant performance period compares with TSR in relation to the ordinary shares of the companies in the comparator group in the same period.
Where the TSR of Northern Foods over the performance period places it between the median and the upper quartile the number of shares will be calculated on a straight line basis with 20% of the shares being received when Northern Foods is placed above median, and 50% being received where Northern Foods is placed in the upper quartile.
Where Northern Foods growth in TSR places it below median, no shares will vest in relation to this element of the award.
Return on invested capital ROIC : 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
Growth in ROIC over the period has to be 100 or more basis points.
The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a straight line basis with 7.5% of the shares being received if Northern Foods achieves growth of 100 basis points and maximum of 50% being received if the Company achieves growth of 200 basis points.
D Under the Share bonus plan, 80% of annual bonus opportunity is linked to specific financial targets, including targets for profit from operations and profit before tax, both measured before restructuring items.
The other 20% is directly related to individual performance against personal performance contracts set at the start of the financial year, which contain six individual and business performance targets which are considered appropriately stretching.
E The Deferred share bonus plan DSBP was introduced in June 2006 so as to incentivise and retain the key talent necessary to drive the specific performance improvements required.
Performance was assessed against key milestones over the 12 month period to 31 March 2007.
These four key milestones related to improving free cash flow and reducing net debt as at 1 April 2006 by 125m, reducing the run rate for central costs by 12m per annum compared to 2005 06 and the successful resolution of the pension deficit.
This DSBP provided a smaller number of key senior executives with an award of shares with a value up to 100% of base salary, at the prevailing market price of 81.75 pence per share on 13 July 2006.
These shares will be satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held in trust after the vesting date in July 2009.
F The Performance share plan was introduced to incentivise the Groups senior executives.
There are two performance conditions which will align the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders.
TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on TSR growth over the performance period.
TSR is required to grow by 30% from the effective base of 1.24 for 7.5% of the shares to vest up to a maximum of 50% being received if the TSR grows by 80% or more.
ROIC: 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a straight line basis with 7.5% of the shares being received if the Group achieves growth of 100 basis points and maximum of 50% being received if the Group achieves growth of 200 basis points or more.
G The award of matching shares to S Barden was made as part of his recruitment as chief executive.
The performance conditions attached to the matching share award are the same as those for the Performance share plan see F save that threshold vesting of the TSR element will not occur unless the Group achieves growth in TSR of 35% over the relevant period.
Half the matching award will vest on the third anniversary of the grant with the other half vesting on the fourth anniversary of the grant to the extent that the performance conditions are met and providing he retains the purchased shares and remains employed by the Group.
H The Group introduced a HM Revenue & Customs approved savings-related share option plan for all employees.
There are no performance conditions attached to these options.
I This relates to the second year of awards under the Performance share plan.
The two performance conditions which will align the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders are: TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on TSR growth over the performance period.
TSR is required to grow by 30% from the effective base of 0.659 for 7.5% of the shares to vest up to a maximum of 50% being received if the TSR grows by 80% or more.

35 Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees, principally the Northern Foods Pension Scheme the Scheme and Northern Foods Pension Builder Pension Builder in the United Kingdom and the Green Isle Foods Group Retirement and Death Benefit Plan the Plan in the Republic of Ireland.
Under the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on pay and service.
The Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are funded schemes whilst the Groups Post retirement medical benefit scheme is unfunded.
The Scheme and the Plan are final salary schemes.
The assets of the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the Group.
On 22 March 2005 the Company announced the closure of the Scheme to new entrants and withdrew its agreement to allow early retirement on an enhanced basis.
Pension Builder was introduced on 1 May 2005 and is available to all UK based employees.
Pension Builder is a defined benefit scheme based on the career average principle.
Northern Foods has reviewed the future cost of delivering benefits against a challenging background of social and economic changes in order to maintain competitiveness and long term success.
This has resulted in approximately 300 of the senior management population moving from the Scheme and Pension Builder to a defined contribution scheme from 29 March 2009.
The most recent valuation of the Scheme for the purpose of the financial statements and the present value of defined benefit obligations was carried out at 28 March 2009 by an independent qualified actuary,  LLP.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation asset, the related current service cost and past service cost was measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and Pension Builder are detailed below.
Valuation date 2009 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 3.0% 3.9% Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.7% 3.1% Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.0% 3.4% Discount rate 6.8% 6.4% Inflation assumption 2.8% 3.4% Highlights Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 95 Northern Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2008 09 35 Retirement benefit obligations continued Sensitivities The mortality assumptions used are based on mortality experience of the Scheme and anticipated mortality experience.
The assumptions are below the national average reflecting the socio-economic make up of the Scheme membership.
For the valuation at 28 March 2009, the Company has adopted the medium cohort principle for the Scheme and Pension Builder 2007 08: medium cohort.
If life expectancy is increased or decreased by one year, liabilities are estimated to increase or decrease by 15.0m respectively.
The impact of a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase liabilities by 11.0m respectively.
The impact of a 0.1% increase or decrease in the rate of increase to pensions would increase or decrease liabilities by 5.2m respectively.
The impact of a 0.1% increase or decrease in the inflation assumption would increase or decrease liabilities by 1.5m respectively.
The life expectancy in years for a member aged 65 is as follows: Valuation date 2009 2008 Current pensioner male 18.7 18.7 female 21.0 21.0 Future pensioner male 20.0 20.0 female 22.2 22.2 Post retirement medical benefit scheme Until 31 March 1999, the Group operated a post retirement medical benefit scheme.
The method of accounting, assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes detailed on page 94.
The main actuarial assumptions are the underlying medical cost inflation of 4.8% per annum 2007 08: 5.4% and the discount rate of 6.8% per annum 2007 08: 6.4%.
If the assumed rate of underlying medical cost inflation increased or decreased by 1.0% per annum then the valuation of the liabilities is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately 0.5m 2007 08: 0.4m respectively.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes and post employment medical benefit scheme are as follows: Defined benefit Post retirement Total retirement schemes medical benefit scheme benefit schemes 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m m m Current service cost 6.2 9.7 6.2 9.7 Interest on obligation 45.0 42.3 0.3 0.2 45.3 42.5 Expected return on scheme assets 53.8 58.2 53.8 58.2 Curtailment gain 1.2 1.2 3.8 6.2 0.3 0.2 3.5 6.0 The service cost for the period has been included within cost of sales 5.4m 2007 08: 8.4m, distribution costs 0.3m 2007 08: 0.5m and administrative expenses 0.5m 2007 08: 0.8m.
The interest on obligation and expected return on scheme assets is included within financing.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The curtailment gain of 1.2m consists of a 0.4m gain following the mothballing of the Fenland site, and a 0.8m gain on moving 300 members of the leadership population out of the defined benefit schemes to a defined contribution scheme effective 1 April 2009.

The overall expected rate of return is the weighted average of the returns above, allowing for anticipated balances held in each asset class according to the Schemes investment strategy.
The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of 126.2m 2007 08: 16.0m.
Work has continued to reduce future funding volatility of the Scheme as the revised investment strategy, agreed in 2008 09 is implemented.
Paragraph 106 of IAS 19 requires the expected return on plan assets to be based on market expectations of returns over the entire life of the related obligation and as such the revised expected returns have been reflected.
The weighted average expected return of the revised investment strategy is 7.1% and this will be used to calculate the expected return on assets for 2009 10.

The cumulative effect of the experience adjustments on scheme assets as included in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense is a loss of 170.2m 2007 08: gain of 9.8m.
The Group expects to make contributions of approximately 5m to its defined benefit schemes in 2009 10.
98 Northern Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2008 09 No tes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Events after the balance sheet date On 27 May 2008 the Group announced that following the conclusion of negotiations to seek mutually acceptable and commercially viable terms for business supplied from Northern Foods Hull ready meals facility, Northern Foods and its main customer served by the site have agreed to terminate the existing supply contracts.
As a result, we will be commencing consultation with employees on a proposal to cease production and close the site, in accordance with our strategy to continue with business only where terms generate an adequate return.
The proposal includes consultation to move a proportion of production to other facilities.
The net profit impact in 2009 10 will be minimal and the Company will incur a one off cash restructuring cost in the 2009 10 financial year which is expected to be less than 5m.
Our 2008 09 accounts include a non-cash impairment of 5.9m.
The Group has also proposed a final dividend outlined in note 11 which is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.
There have been no other post balance sheet events.
