The historical volatility is calculated using a weekly rolling share price for the three year period immediately prior to the option grant date.
Share options are granted under a service condition and, for grants to senior employees, a nonmarket performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.

Provisions Group and Parent Company Closed Shop Provision 2009 2008 000 000 Balance at start of year 5,271 Additional provision in the year 1,263 3,715 Transfer from trade and other payables 1,556 Utilised in year 2,381 Balance at end of year 4,153 5,271 Included in current liabilities 857 2,843 Included in noncurrent liabilities 3,296 2,428 4,153 5,271 The closed shop provision relates to costs in respect of the closure of shops and in particular the onerous lease and other commitments associated with the closure of a shop.
Included within the provision is 199,000 in respect of possible recourse on leases transferred to the purchaser on the sale of the Belgian operation.
The key area of uncertainty relates to the net future rental costs to be incurred on closed shops and, in particular, whether the shops can be sublet until lease exit.
The provision assumes that subletting is unlikely in the current climate.
The provision is expected to be substantially utilised within three years such that the impact of discounting would not be material.
