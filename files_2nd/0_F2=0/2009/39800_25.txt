FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Groups financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
In addition, the Group has also followed best practice recommendations issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 33.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement for the Parent Company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and the financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
These financial statements are presented in sterling since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
Management believes that the judgements, estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable, however actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements, where made, are disclosed within the relevant section of the financial statements in which such judgements have been applied.
The key estimates and assumptions relate to the property valuations applied by the Groups property valuers, the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations, valuation of share options granted under share-based payment schemes, the valuation of available-for-sale investments and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Brixton at acquisition and are described in more detail in the accounting policy notes below, or the applicable note to the financial statements.
During 2009 the Group has adopted the IASBs Annual Improvements of IFRSs as they relate to development properties, IFRS 8 Operating Segments and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007.
Previously, development properties were accounted for under IAS 16, but are now accounted for under IAS 40.
This change has meant that with effect from 1 January 2009, revaluation surpluses and deficits on development properties are now recognised in the income statement rather than in equity.
There is no impact on previously reported figures in respect of this change, as prior year comparatives are not required to be restated.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments is effective from 1 January 2009, resulting in a change to presentation and disclosure of the Groups segmental analysis, whereby business segments are no longer shown.
IAS 1 revised 2007 requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
As a result, a statement of changes in equity for each period is presented.
The amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk.
The Group also adopted IAS 23 revised 2007, Borrowing Costs and IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, neither of which materially impact the current or prior year reported results.
Following the rights issue and share consolidation the comparative earnings per share and net assets per share calculations have been restated as discussed in more detail in note 14.
This restatement has not impacted the income statement or balance sheet and therefore, since it has not changed from the previously presented figures, a balance sheet at 31 December 2007 has not been shown.
The following published standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and in some cases have not been adopted by the EU have not been adopted early by the Group: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended, Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate: IFRS 2 amended, Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations: IFRS 3 revised 2008, Business Combinations: IAS 27 revised 2008, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 revised 2008, Investments in Associates: IAS 32 amended, Classification of Rights Issues: IAS 39 amended, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items: IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements: IFRIC 14, amended, Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement: IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers: IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: and Improvements to IFRSs April 2009.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for the treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries and associates when IFRS 3 revised 2008, IAS 27 revised 2008 and IAS 28 revised 2008 come into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2010.
86 SEGRO plc Annual Report 2009 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group income statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts are: Balance sheet: 1 1.13 31 December 2008: 1 1.05 Income statement: 1 1.12 2008: 1 1.26 Investment properties These properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the income statement.
As the Group uses the fair value model as per IAS 40, no depreciation is provided.
Development properties These comprise properties acquired to be developed for future use as investment properties and are initially measured at cost including capitalised interest where applicable.
Development properties are held at fair value on the same basis as investment properties with revaluation movements being booked in the income statement.
Trading properties These are properties developed and held for sale, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Property purchases and sales Property purchases and sales are recognised on the date of unconditional exchange, or, where exchange is conditional, on the date that the conditions have been satisfied.
com 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee, are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Revenue Revenue includes rent, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Rental income This includes net income from managed operations.
Rentals from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For properties let as finance leases, minimum lease receipts are apportioned between finance income and principal repayment, but receipts that were not fixed at lease inception e. g. rent review rises, are booked as income when earned.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided at the reporting date.
Service charge income was previously presented within gross rental income, however it is now presented against property operating expenses at 31 December 2009 in order to be more consistent with industry practice.
This change in presentation has also been reflected in the 31 December 2008 year comparatives with 25.3 million being reclassified in order to present results on a consistent basis.
The change has had no net impact on net rental income.
Financial instruments Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives especially interest rate swaps in managing interest rate risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the income statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged.
None of the Groups interest rate derivatives qualify as a hedge.
However, there are USD and Euro forward currency sales that have been designated as effective net investment hedges.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, since cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Available-for-sale AFS investments AFS investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to market value based on quarterly reports received from the fund manager, or other market evidence where publicly traded.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Pensions Defined benefit schemes The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the balance sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the income statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through equity in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in note 24.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that performance will not be met.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model.

A detailed breakdown of the adjustments and additional adjustments to the share of profit loss from joint ventures are included in note 9.
The adjustments outlined above arise from adopting the recommendations of the Best Practices Committee of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate or relate to exceptional items that are disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable better understanding of performance.
The EPRA adjusted profit measure is included to enable comparison between European property companies.
Adjusted profit before tax previous reporting basis relates to the Groups profit before tax adjusting for investment, development and owner occupied property gains and losses whether realised or unrealised, fair value of derivatives gains or losses and excluding exceptional items.
This approach is consistent with adjusted profit as reported in prior periods.
Adjusted profit before tax recurring rental profits includes additional adjustments for trading property gains and losses whether realised or unrealised and other investment income.
In March 2009, the Group revised its dividend policy such that, from 2009 onwards, dividends will be based upon underlying recurring rental earnings which excludes trading property gains losses and other investment income.
This approach is therefore consistent with the new dividend policy and relates to the Groups core property rental business.
It is intended to adopt this approach as the Groups core Adjusted profit metric for reporting purposes going forward.
com 89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Adoption of IFRS 8, Operating Segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and returns approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
As a result, following the adoption of IFRS 8, the identification of the Groups reportable segments has resulted in only geographical segments being disclosed on a consistent basis with prior year.
A detailed breakdown of the adjustments to the share of profit loss from joint ventures are included in note 9.
ACQUISITIONS Brixton plc On 24 August 2009, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the voting equity in Brixton, in a share for share exchange for 186.8 million.
Brixton was previously an investor in industrial and warehousing property in the UK, listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The benefits of the transaction are discussed more fully in the Financial Review on page 27.
The acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
A gain arose on acquisition which has been immediately credited to the income statement, shown separately as gain arising from bargain purchase.
Details of the book values and the fair values of the assets and liabilities at the date of the acquisition, after making the necessary adjustments described below, are summarised as follows: Fair value Fair value Book values adjustment Total m m m Non-current assets investment properties 1,143.7 1,143.7 Non-current assets other 43.7 0.8 42.9 Receivables 21.0 12.1 8.9 Cash 67.7 67.7 Derivatives 134.3 134.3 Other current liabilities 65.0 65.0 Non-current liabilities debt 873.9 15.9 858.0 Deferred tax liability 4.6 4.6 Other non-current liabilities 5.9 5.9 Net assets at date of acquisition 192.4 3.0 195.4 Total consideration for net assets acquired 186.8 Gain arising on bargain purchase 8.6 Fair value adjustments arise on debt, receivables and non-current assets.
The book value of Brixton bonds was based on amortised cost at acquisition and therefore adjusted to fair value.
Fair value was ascertained using comparable instruments actively traded.
Receivables have been adjusted in respect of tenant incentive balances for rent free periods and letting fees paid prior to acquisition being written off.
Receivables are stated net of 0.8 million bad debt provision.
The non-current assets adjustment is in relation to the carrying value of joint ventures where tenant incentive balances have been adjusted as described above and the write off of Groups share of capitalised finance costs.
The enterprise value of the acquisition is 1,111.4 million and is calculated by adding back net debt and derivatives to total consideration for net assets acquired.
Consideration is made up as follows: m Market value of shares issued in exchange for net assets 173.8 Expenses paid 13.0 Total consideration for net assets acquired 186.8 Less non-cash consideration 173.8 Less cash acquired 67.7 Net cash inflow arising on acquisition 54.7 Settlement of bank borrowings 245.0 Buy back of bonds 262.7 Settlement of derivatives 126.3 Net cash outflow arising on closing out Brixton debt and derivatives 634.0 www.

The total dividend paid and proposed per share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 is 14.0 pence 2008 13.7 pence.
The comparative per share data is based on the actual number of shares in issue at the time.
EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS PER SHARE The earnings per share calculations use the weighted average number of shares and the net assets per share calculations use the number of shares in issue at year end.
Both earnings per share and net assets per share calculations exclude 1.3 million shares held on trust for employee share schemes 2008 1.5 million.
On 7 April 2009, the Company issued 5,240.7 million new ordinary shares pre-share consolidation through a rights issue.
The rights issue was offered at 10 pence per share and represented a discount to the fair value of the existing shares.
The number of shares used for prior year calculations of earnings per share and net assets per share shown below have been adjusted for the discounted rights issue in order to provide a comparable basis for the current year.
An adjustment factor of 6.92 has been applied based on the Companys share price of 136.5 pence per share on 20 March 2009, the day before the new shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange and the theoretical ex-rights price at that date of 19.73 pence per share.
In addition, the impact of the 10 for 1 share consolidation has also resulted in an adjustment to the prior period comparables.
Note 25 provides further detail on the rights issue and the share consolidation.
As discussed in note 1, these adjustments to comparative earnings per share and net assets per share calculations have not impacted the income statement or balance sheet and therefore, since it has not changed from the previously presented figures, a balance sheet at 31 December 2007 has not been shown.

The information in the Property Analysis booklet is unaudited and does not form part of the financial statements.
Investment, development and owner occupied properties are stated at market value as at 31 December 2009 based on external valuations performed by professionally qualified valuers.
In prior periods, the Groups wholly owned property portfolio was valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung DTZ and CB Richard Ellis, however DTZ were appointed as sole external valuer of the wholly owned portfolio for the 31 December 2009 valuations.
Valuations for some of the joint venture properties within the UK portfolio were performed by King Sturge and Colliers CRE at 31 December 2009 consistent with prior years.
The valuations conform to International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of the transaction prices paid for similar properties.
DTZ, CB Richard Ellis, Colliers CRE and King Sturge also undertake some professional and letting work on behalf of the Group, although this is limited in relation to the activities of the Group as a whole.
All four firms have advised us that the total fees paid by the Group represent less than 5 per cent of their total revenue in any year.
From 1 January 2009, all development properties are accounted for under IAS 40 see note 1.
As a result, properties under development that were previously classified as investment property have been reclassified to development property so that all properties being developed are grouped together.
Development properties includes land available for development, land under development and construction in progress.
The historical cost of investment and development properties was 4,660.4 million 2008 3,732.9 million and the cumulative valuation surplus at 31 December 2009 amounted to 164.9 million 2008 578.2 million.
Long-term leasehold values within investment properties amount to 9.8 million 2008 11.2 million.
All other properties are freehold.
Net rental income in the period from rented investment properties was 290.7 million 2008 236.6 million.
Prepaid operating lease incentives at 31 December 2009 were 32.7 million 2008 31.1 million.

FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES The Group has leased out a number of investment properties under finance leases.
These are presented as finance lease receivables rather than investment properties.
A reconciliation between finance lease receivables and the present value of the minimum lease payments receivable at the balance sheet date is as follows: Present value of minimum Minimum lease payments lease payments 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Amounts receivable under finance leases: Within one year 0.7 1.0 0.2 In the second to fifth years inclusive 3.1 3.6 0.4 0.6 Later than five years 21.3 25.2 8.5 9.6 25.1 29.8 8.9 10.4 Less unearned finance income 16.2 19.4 n a n a Present value of minimum lease payments receivable 8.9 10.4 8.9 10.4 Analysed as : Non-current finance lease receivables 24.4 28.8 8.9 10.2 Current finance lease receivables 0.7 1.0 0.2 25.1 29.8 8.9 10.4 The interest rate inherent in the lease is fixed at the contract date for all of the lease term.
The weighted average interest rate on finance lease receivables at 31 December 2009 is 7.8 per cent 2008 7.7 per cent.
At 31 December 2009, the fair value of the Groups finance lease receivables is 8.9 million 2008 10.4 million, while the unguaranteed residual values of assets leased under finance leases are estimated at 1.8 million 2008 2.4 million.

Financial covenants relating to the borrowings include maximum limits to the Groups gearing ratio and minimum limits to permitted interest cover.
Financial covenants are discussed in more detail in the Gearing and Financial Covenants section in the Financial Review on page 32.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES Categories of financial instruments Financial assets in the Group comprise forward foreign exchange contracts which are categorised as derivatives designated as fair value through the income statement non hedge.
Financial assets also include finance lease receivables, available-for-sale investments and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classified as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise interest rate swaps which are categorised as fair value through the income statement non hedge.
Financial liabilities also include secured bank loans, unsecured bond issues, unsecured loan notes, bank loans and overdrafts and preference shares, all of which are categorised as debt at amortised cost, and trade and other payables, provisions and current tax liabilities, which are classified as other financial liabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues, secured bank loans and unsecured loan notes.
At 31 December 2009 the fair value of 1,934.1 million of unsecured bond issues was 1,892.8 million 2008 1,286.3 million compared to 875.8 million fair value, the fair value of 94.7 million of secured bank loans was 97.5 million 2008 108.8 million compared to 109.2 million fair value, and the fair value of 49.3 million of unsecured loans was 49.8 million 2008 52.8 million compared to 53.9 million fair value.
com 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments, such as those classified as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but use one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate a marketability discount will be applied.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Parent entity to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.
As the borrowing entity will have unencumbered directly owned property assets exceeding the value of the guaranteed borrowings the probability of the Parent entity having to recognise any loss in respect to these guarantees is considered to be highly unlikely.
Hence no fair value liability has been ascribed to these guarantees in the accounts of the Parent entity.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps as detailed in notes 17, 18 and 23.
All of these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and notes 25 to 27.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in note 20.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk management The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency flows.
However, it does have operations in Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing balance sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section in the Financial Review on page 33.
The Groups balance sheet translation exposure is summarised below: Euros US dollars Total Euros US dollars Total Group m m m m m m Gross currency assets 1,867.5 32.4 1,899.9 2,054.9 35.7 2,090.6 Gross currency liabilities 1,315.8 24.9 1,340.7 1,791.0 27.6 1,818.6 Net exposure 551.7 7.5 559.2 263.9 8.1 272.0 Company Gross currency assets 871.4 871.4 433.5 433.5 Gross currency liabilities 870.4 24.9 895.3 859.6 27.6 887.2 Net exposure 1.0 24.9 23.9 426.1 27.6 453.7 2009 gross currency liabilities include USD40.3 million 24.9 million designated as a net investment hedge.
2008 gross currency liabilities include EUR455.7 million 434.0 million and USD40.3 million 27.6 million designated as net investment hedges.
104 SEGRO plc Annual Report 2009 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 62.1 million 2008 30.2 million, with a sensitivity of 61.3 million against the euro 2008 29.3 million and 0.8 million against the US dollar 2008 0.9 million.
For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 2.9 million 2008 50.4 million with a sensitivity of 0.1 million against the euro 2008 47.3 million and 2.8 million against the US dollar 2008 3.1 million.
Forward foreign exchange contracts In the current year, the Group has entered into various forward sales and currency swap contracts that are effectively cash flow hedges, using the surplus cash in one currency to temporarily fund paying off debt in another currency.
These have not been designated as hedges and as a consequence their change in fair value is taken through the income statement.
The following table details the forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding as at the year end: Currency contract local Average exchange rates currency Contract value Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 rate rate m m m m m m Group Cash flow hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.11 1.20 688.5 242.7 609.4 231.1 8.2 28.0 Net investment hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.23 209.7 199.8 29.1 Sell US dollars buy sterling 1.45 25.0 17.1 0.1 8.2 57.0 Company Cash flow hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.11 1.21 688.5 452.4 609.4 430.9 8.2 57.1 Sell US dollars buy sterling 1.45 25.0 17.1 0.1 8.2 57.0 Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that around 60 to 100 per cent of borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Treasury Risk Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Group Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2009 would decrease increase by 5.5 million 2008 decrease increase by 3.0 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the balance sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Economic cash flow hedges Outstanding pay fixed, receive floating contracts are as follows: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m Group In one year or less 5.68 17.7 0.7 In more than one year but less than two 4.4 212.4 4.7 In more than two years but less than five 3.01 3.9 243.4 761.9 7.1 30.2 Total 261.1 974.3 7.8 34.9 Company In one year or less 4.3 123.8 2.3 In more than two years but less than five 2.62 4.0 44.2 423.8 0.6 19.2 Total 44.2 547.6 0.6 21.5 Economic fair value hedge receivable Outstanding receive fixed, pay floating contracts are as follows: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % m m m m Group More than 5 years 6.75 300.0 7.6 Company More than 5 years 6.75 300.0 7.6 The above cash flow and fair value hedges are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them.
Hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the income statement rather than to other equity.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a 3 month or 6 month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or Sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables which include unpaid rent and amounts receivable in respect of property disposals were approximately 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2009 and at 31 December 2008.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
2009 Aging of past due but not impaired receivables were as follows: m 0 -30 days 11.6 30-60 days 3.5 60-90 days 0.6 90-180 days 1.0 180 days Past due but not impaired 16.7 Not due 36.5 Total receivables 53.2 No other receivables were considered impaired.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquid funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
106 SEGRO plc Annual Report 2009 Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows forward over a rolling 12 month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity Position and Going Concern sections in the Financial Review on pages 32 and 33.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity profile for its financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Background The Group has four defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the Slough scheme, the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme and two additional schemes following the acquisition of Brixton, the Brixton plc Pension Plan the Brixton scheme and the J Saville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme the Industrious scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held by Trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes in the UK and Continental Europe.
All four defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
Valuation of the schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations: 31 March 2007 for Slough, 5 April 2007 for Bilton, 31 December 2008 for Brixton and 30 June 2009 for Industrious and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2009.
The Company has an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS for one employee, the Chief Executive.
This arrangement is a defined benefit scheme in nature.
The calculation of the value of this unapproved benefit promise uses assumptions which are consistent with those used for the Slough scheme.
At 31 December 2009, there are no assets supporting this UURBS, however plans are in place to provide funding for this scheme in 2010.
2009 2008 The major assumptions used were as follows: % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.7 6.0 Rate of inflation 3.7 2.9 Rate of increase to pensions in payment in excess of GMP Before April 2003 Slough Bilton 4.3 3.6 4.2 2.8 From April 2003 to October 2005 3.6 2.8 After October 2005 2.3 2.0 Rate of general long-term increase in salaries 5.7 4.9 Expected Analysis Expected Analysis return of assets return of assets 2009 2009 2008 2008 Composition of scheme assets % m % m Equities 8.5 70.6 7.9 45.0 Gilts 4.5 29.8 4.0 33.1 Bonds 5.5 53.7 5.8 30.9 Property 9.0 0.8 6.9 0.9 Insured pensions 5.7 2.0 Other assets 1.0 0.7 2.8 0.2 Overall Slough scheme 6.7 102.3 6.2 89.1 Overall Bilton scheme 6.3 21.9 5.9 21.0 Overall Brixton scheme 6.7 33.4 Life expectancy at age The mortality rates used are as follows: 65 years Mortality table Male Female Current pensioners PNxA00U2007MC with 1% p. a. underpin to future improvements 22.1 24.5 Future pensioners PNxA00U2007MC with 1% p. a. underpin to future improvements 23.6 25.9 The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes.
Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Bond and gilt returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.

112 SEGRO plc Annual Report 2009 The rights issue required certain resolutions to be passed at the General Meeting held on 20 March 2009 as follows: a a special resolution to sub-divide and reclassify each existing authorised but unissued ordinary share of 271 12 pence into new ordinary shares of 1 pence each: b a special resolution to sub-divide and reclassify each existing authorised issued ordinary share of 271 12 pence each into one new ordinary share of 1 pence and one deferred share of 261 12 pence each: c an ordinary resolution to increase the authorised share capital of the Company from 146,000,000 to 250,000,000 by the creation of 10,340,000,000 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the capital of the Company ranking pari passu with the existing new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the capital of the Company: d an ordinary resolution that the Directors be generally and unconditionally authorised to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot relevant securities of the Company up to an aggregate nominal value of 52,406,507 5,240,650,704 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the capital of the Company pursuant to a rights issue of 12 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each for each existing share of 271 12 pence each: and e a special resolution that the Company shall be irrevocably appointed as agent and or attorney of the holders of the deferred shares and in such capacity shall be authorised to, inter alia, cancel and or acquire all or any of the deferred shares.
On 7 May 2009, the Company acquired and, subsequently, cancelled all deferred shares that were in issue.
At the General Meeting held on 28 July 2009: a an ordinary resolution was passed to conduct a share consolidation, consolidating and re-classifying 10 of each existing authorised and existing issued shares of the Company of 1 pence each into 1 share of 10 pence each.
The purpose of the share consolidation was to reduce the number of the Companys shares in issue so that the likely share price is appropriate for a Company of SEGROs size.
The share consolidation took effect on 31 July 2009. b a special resolution was passed for the Company to issue 119,047,619 10 pence ordinary shares under the placing and open offer at an issue price of 210p per ordinary share.
The shares began trading on 31 July 2009.
Pursuant to the acquisition of Brixton plc discussed in more detail in note 4 on 24 August 2009, as detailed in the scheme of arrangement document dated 17 July 2009, the Company issued 47,548,742 ordinary shares to Brixton shareholders which began trading on 25 August 2009.
25 ii Share-based payments With the exception of the share incentive plan where no adjustments were made and the global share incentive plan which was adjusted on the basis of a cashless exercise of the rights available under the rights issue, the Groups employee share schemes were adjusted for the rights issue on the basis of a HMRC approved formula, whereby the number of shares under option or award were multiplied by 6.92 and the exercise price was multiplied by 0.14.
As a result, participants of the various plans were no better or worse off as a result of the rights issue.
The number of options or awards under the Groups employee share schemes were subsequently reduced by a factor of ten and the exercise price increased by the same factor for the share consolidation.
Consequently, no additional expense was or will be recognised as a result of changes to the Groups employee share schemes.
Prior year comparables have been restated to reflect adjustments outlined above.
In addition, movements in allocations from 1 January 2009 to 31 July 2009 and the corresponding weighted average exercise price have also been adjusted to reflect the rights issue and share consolidation, as appropriate.
25 iii Executive share option plan ESOP The options in the executive share option plan are exercisable after three years but before ten years, subject to performance conditions.
The employee would normally have to remain with the Group for the three year period.
If the performance conditions have not been met by the third anniversary of the date of the grant, the options lapse.
The performance conditions are based on an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share by the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3 per cent per annum over the three year period.
At 24 February 2010, the number of ordinary shares under option in respect of the 1994 approved scheme was 3,746 at an option price of 515.3p and in respect of the 2002 approved and unapproved schemes were 8,704 and 214,930 respectively, with option prices ranging from 419.2p to 689.2p expiring on various dates up to 28 April 2015.

25 viii Cash settled overseas senior employees scheme One of the plans for overseas senior employees is a cash settlement scheme which mirrors the performance of the executive share option plan in 25 iii on page 114.
A notional number of shares were granted to employees equal to 100 per cent of their salary and divided by the share price on the date of the grant.
The equivalent of 54,148 shares were granted in 2005, based on the performance and assumptions of the executive share option plan on 29 April 2005.
The Black-Scholes model was used to fair value these shares at prevailing market rates, at a share price equivalent to 689.2p.
There have been no further grants since 2005.
The Company does not intend to make further grants under this scheme.
