THE BOARD, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES Remuneration report 53 9 Policy regarding pensions Andrew Cosslett, Richard Solomons and other senior UK-based employees participate on the same basis in the executive section of the registered defined benefit InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan and, if appropriate, the InterContinental Executive Top-Up Scheme.
The latter is an unfunded arrangement, but with appropriate security provided via a fixed charge on a hotel asset.
As an alternative to these unfunded arrangements, a cash allowance may be taken.
This Plan is now closed to new entrants.
Senior US-based executives participate in US retirement benefits plans.
Executives outside the UK and US participate in the InterContinental Hotels Group International Savings and Retirement Plan or other local plans.
10 Non-Executive Directors pay policy and structure Non-Executive Directors are paid a fee which is approved by the Board, having taken account of the fees paid in other companies of a similar complexity.
Higher fees are payable to the Senior Independent Director who chairs the Audit Committee and to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, reflecting the additional responsibilities of these roles.
In February 2009, a Corporate Responsibility Committee was established.
Jennifer Laing was appointed Chairman of this Committee on 1 March 2009.
Her fee was consequently increased pro rata by 10,000 per annum in recognition of these additional duties.
In light of the challenging external environment and consistent with the Executive salary freeze in 2009, the scheduled review of Non-Executive Director fees was postponed by an additional year.
Thus, Non-Executive Director fees were reviewed in the final quarter of 2009 and an increase of 2% for the Chairman and 5% for the Non-Executive Directors was agreed by the Board to be effective from 1 January 2010.
Non-Executive Director fees were last increased in 2007.
Non-Executive Directors fee levels have been typically reviewed every two years.
In view of prevailing market practice, this has been moved to an annual review in 2010.
The following table sets out the change in annual fee rates from 2009 to 2010 for the Non-Executive Directors.

Andrew Cosslett and Richard Solomons have service agreements with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments are intended to have 12-month notice periods.
However, on occasion, to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months may be used, in accordance with the Combined Code.
No provisions for compensation for termination following change of control, nor for liquidated damages of any kind, are included in the current Directors contracts.
In the event of any early termination of an Executive Directors contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.
David Websters appointment as Non-Executive Chairman, effective from 1 January 2004, is subject to six months notice.
The dates of appointment of the other Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 41.
